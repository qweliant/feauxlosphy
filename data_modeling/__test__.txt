thing is that we never stop debatingArchives TERFshttpswwwcontrapointscom7192020 Archived Transcript of TERFs  ContraPointshttpswwwcontrapointscomtranscriptsarchivesterfs 210Tonight well be debating the question are trans women women My first guest is Tiffany Tumbles host of the popular YouTube series Trans Tips with Tiffany Clarence could we role a clipHey fam welcome to trans tips with Tiffany with new feminization secrets every week to help you unlock your inner woman This week Ill be demonstrating how women eat barbecued ribs So you have your rack of ribs and what men will do is they hold the rib like this and they just dig right in Now some guys like it if you do that they like a girl whos a little bit messy But if you want to appear more feminine what you should do is just kind ofroar utter chaos smashing eating smearing bbq sauce Fuck Shit its so good Motherfucker crying etcJACKIE Wow truly inspiring My other guest tonight is Abigail Cockbane feminist activist and author of The Trans Menace Lesbian Genocide and the Rape of Feminism So tell me Abigail are trans women really womenABIGAIL If by trans women you mean men who put on lipstick and invade womens spaces then no men are not womenJACKIE Ok And Tiffany what do you say to thatTIFFANY Um do I really have to respond to thatJACKIE Well yes Yes you do Youre here to debate arent you The debate must commence Tiffany the debate must commenceTIFFANY Well I am a woman I live my life as a woman I wake up as a woman I make love as a woman I experience sexism as a woman Im treated like a woman in public ABIGAIL No no no no no no Females are oppressed under patriarchy because men want control of our wombs Males httpswwwcontrapointscom7192020 Archived Transcript of TERFs  ContraPointshttpswwwcontrapointscomtranscriptsarchivesterfs 310impersonating women dont have wombs and they cannot be oppressed on that basisTIFFANY Well what about infertile cis women men dont want to control their wombs but they still experience sexism dont theyABIGAIL Yes because being female means youre assumed to have female reproductive function Men do not try to control the reproductive function of other men pretending to be womenTIFFANY I am not a man pretending to be a woman When men catcall trans women when they rape us when they harass us when they deny us employment they dont care that we dont have wombs they only care that were womenABIGAIL Well does any of that even happen I mean I for one can always tell the difference between a real woman and a man in a wig and Im pretty sure so can menTIFFANY Well you would know that it happens all the time if you were willing to listen to the experiences of trans women but youre not willing to do that because you are a TERFstingABIGAIL What did you just call meJACKIE Yeah what does that meanTIFFANY A TERF A transexclusionary radical feministABIGAIL That is a vicious antifemale slurTIFFANY You know its really not Its just a fact that thats what you are If anything its too generous because theres nothing radical or feminist about your viewstinghttpswwwcontrapointscom7192020 Archived Transcript of TERFs  ContraPointshttpswwwcontrapointscomtranscriptsarchivesterfs 410ABIGAIL WhatTIFFANY Youre a bad feministABIGAIL What did you sayJACKIE Aw yeah this is a hot exchange of ideas Keep it going girlsTIFFANY Youre a bad feminist This is just reactionary gender essentialism with a radical veneerABIGAIL How dare you say that Ill teach you a thing or two about gender essentialism Gender essentialism is the idea that wearing high heels and a miniskirt makes you a womanTIFFANY I never wear high heels or miniskirts why do you think trans women do thisABIGAIL Well Caitlyn JennerTIFFANY Not all trans women are Caitlyn Jenner A lot of trans women are very feminine because we have to be in order for society to recognize us as women But makeup and long hair are not what makes us women thats just one way of communicating a truth that comes from withinABIGAIL Right so any hairy man who decides he feels like a woman one day can strut around naked in a womens locker room with his genitals flopping around and women who have been abused by men are expected to just allow that in their safe spaceTIFFANY Why is it always hairy and flopping genitals Trans women as a group are the most devoted body hair removers Ive ever met Theyre also some of the least likely to flop their genitals in public httpswwwcontrapointscom7192020 Archived Transcript of TERFs  ContraPointshttpswwwcontrapointscomtranscriptsarchivesterfs 510ABIGAIL That doesnt matter To a woman who has been abused the sight of male genitals is still triggeringJACKIE Wouldnt a sexual assailants genitals be hard instead of floppingTIFFANY I dont know but thats not the point Trans women are not hairy men who decide to wave their genitals at women This is just a scenario youve made up to scare people into thinking trans women are really just predatory menABIGAIL Im not making it up It happens all the time I can send you at least a dozen Daily Mail articles about itTIFFANY Oh the Daily Mail that radical feminist publication we all love so muchJACKIE Im sorry can I interrupt here It seems like the disagreement in this exchange is about what it means to be a woman Abigail it seems like the idea youre bringing to the marketplace is that women are people with vaginas and Tiffany youre trying to sell us on the idea that a woman is someone who fills the social role of a woman is that rightTIFFANY Well not exactly I mean you can radically reject conventional social roles while still being a woman This is why I emphasize psychology what matters is that you feel at ease with female embodiment and ill at ease with male embodimentABIGAIL Well Im not at ease with female embodimentTIFFANY Well would you rather be in a mans bodyABIGAIL Ew no The problem isnt my body and Im not going mutilate my body because Im not delusional like you The problem is the gendered assumptions that society projects onto female bodies If we abolish gender well also abolish gender dysphoriahttpswwwcontrapointscom7192020 Archived Transcript of TERFs  ContraPointshttpswwwcontrapointscomtranscriptsarchivesterfs 610TIFFANY But gender dysphoria isnt just dissatisfaction with gendered associations I dont like my body being viewed as a passive object anymore than you do but that doesnt mean Im not dysphoric about my male characteristics or that I dont prefer inhabiting a female bodyABIGAIL But this preference for a female body is nonsense You are a male who wants to occupy a female body like a parasite but you cant so you take pills that make you grow pectoral tissue and you paint your face like a parody of exploited womanhood and even if you do decide to mutilate your genitals youll still have big hands and wide shoulders and youll tower over females like a monster Society needs to stop enabling these ridiculous delusions right now and instead help you to get over the fact that no amount of surgery and makeup can make you into a womanO magnum mysteriumTIFFANY in deep painJACKIE slow applaud That was some good free speech right there at cam I totally just cameTIFFANY Well hold on arent you the one defining womanhood with stereotypes If wearing high heels doesnt make you a woman why does having small handsABIGAIL Because small hands are a result of the same biological features that engender the female reproductive role for which womenfemalesare oppressed under patriarchyTIFFANY Well even if reproductive control is the original reason patriarchy oppresses women reproductive capacity is not the criterion society uses when it comes to treating people like women or menhttpswwwcontrapointscom7192020 Archived Transcript of TERFs  ContraPointshttpswwwcontrapointscomtranscriptsarchivesterfs 710ABIGAIL You think because you identify as a woman society identifies you as one but youre wrong You cant just argue from your feelingsTIFFANY If you were a good feminist then maybe youd be willing to believe womens accounts of their own experiences but since you arent we can rely on data trans women experience domestic violence and employment discrimination at rates even higher than cis women and are less likely to get victim assistanceABIGAIL Well even if trans survey data is to be trusted being a victim still isnt what makes you a womanTIFFANY But you said that having a womb is the reason women are oppressed which in many cases is demonstrably falseABIGAIL Just because some men are victims of sexual violence doesnt mean that theyre womenTIFFANY But if they feel like women live like women and experience misogyny like women why is having a womb still more importantABIGAIL Because thats the original reason women are oppressed in the first placeTIFFANY Even if thats true its not always the reason women are oppressed now What reason could you have to insist on this apart from pure transphobic prejudiceABIGAIL The reason is that words have to mean something I have a definition of womanhood that makes sense and that everyone can understand And you want to tell me that anyone who says theyre a woman is a woman but that kind of postmodern nonsense makes it impossible to politically organize as women and as feminists which leads to men taking over womens movements and womens spaceshttpswwwcontrapointscom7192020 Archived Transcript of TERFs  ContraPointshttpswwwcontrapointscomtranscriptsarchivesterfs 810TIFFANY Your assumption is still that transwomen are lying men pretending to be women for what purpose to enjoy being potentially rejected by their families evicted from their homes abused by the police and raped in prison Why cant you believe that other people are radically unhappy with their assigned gender or sexABIGAIL Because one minute youre telling me severe mental illness is what makes someone transgender and the next youll be asking me to accept that not all trans people transition and that women with short hair are actually a third gender This is counterrevolutionary individualist nonsense that puts personal feelings over political structuresTIFFANY Im not denying political structures Im telling you that individual people interact with those structures in complex ways that dont always correspond to whether or not they have a wombABIGAIL Well give me a coherent definition of gender identity that doesnt fall apart on examination then maybe Ill be willing to reconsiderJACKIE drunk Yeah Tiffany can you explain gender identity I dont get itTIFFANY Well if youre expecting some ultimate definition that perfectly accounts for everyone youll never be satisfied But Abigail has no room to talk She just defined women as people with wombs Well what about women who have hysterectomiesABIGAIL They still have XX chromosomesTIFFANY Well what about women with Swyer syndrome who have a uterus but XY chromosomesABIGAIL Thats an aberrationhttpswwwcontrapointscom7192020 Archived Transcript of TERFs  ContraPointshttpswwwcontrapointscomtranscriptsarchivesterfs 910TIFFANY Well goddamn it Abigail every definition is perfect if you ignore everything that doesnt fit the definition And if this shitty argument is the only reason you can come up with to totally disregard the lived experiences of thousands of trans women well its hard for me to believe thats anything but bigotryJACKIE drunk well honey I dont know if we need to be accusing anyone of bigotry but Abigail if youre so smart then how do you know that shes not a womanlong silence awkward editingABIGAIL Palpatine voice Dost thou bleedTIFFANY WhatABIGAIL Dost thou bleed slams fistDostThouBleedTIFFANY I do not menstruate out of my dick if thats what youre askingABIGAIL Infiltrator Never canst thou enter the sisterhood of the bloodTIFFANY Good I just want to pee I dont want to be part of your creepy vagina cultABIGAIL Oh and now vaginas are creepy This is exactly the kind of antifemale sentiment Ive come to expect from male feminists Jackie I weary of this toilsome man Shall we perform the ritual of the bloodJACKIE Oh is it that time already Yeah yeah sure Lets do itSits at piano plays Moonlight Sonatahttpswwwcontrapointscom7192020 Archived Transcript of TERFs  ContraPointshttpswwwcontrapointscomtranscriptsarchivesterfs 1010CONTACT BECOME A PATRON GALLERYTIFFANY Um what is going onABIGAIL

Birmingham Jail iThe Three Dimensions o f a Complete Life 31Letter from Birmingham Ja ilApril 161963MY DEAR FELLOW CLERGYMENWhile confined here in the Birmingham city jail I came across your recent statement calling my present activities unwise and untim ely Seldom do I pause to answer criticism o f my work and ideas If I sought to answer all the criticisms that cross my desk m y secretaries would have litde time for anything other than such correspondence in the course of the day and I would have no time for constructive w ork But since I feel that you are men of genuine good will and that your criticisms are sincerely set forth I want to try to answer your statement in what I hope will be patient and reasonable termsI think I should indicate why I am here in Birmingham since you have been influenced by the view which argues against outsiders coming in I have the honor o f serving as president of the Southern Christian Leadership Conference an organization operating in everySouthern state with headquarters in Atlanta Georgia We have some eightyfive affiliated organizations across the South and one o f them is the Alabama Christian Movement for Human Rights Frequently we share staff educational and financial resources with our affiliates Several months ago the affiliate here in Birmingham asked us to be on call to engage in a nonviolent direct actionprogram if such were deemed necessary We readily consented and when the hour came we lived up to our promise Sol   along with several members o f my staff am here because I was invited here I am here because I have organizational ties hereBut more basically I am in Birmingham because injustice is here Just as the prophets o f the eighth century BC left their villages and carried their thus saith the Lord far beyond the boundaries o f their home towns and just as the Apostle Paul left his village o f Tarsus and carried the gospel o f Jesus Christ to the far comers of the Greco Roman world so am I compelled to carry the gospel o f freedom beyond my own home town Like Paul I must constantly respond to the Macedonian call for aidMoreover I am cognizant o f the interrelatedness of all communities and states I cannot sit idly by in Atlanta and not be concerned about what happens in Birmingham Injustice anywhere is a threat to justice everywheremarxmarxmarxWe are caught in an inescapable network o f mutuality tied in a single garment of destiny Whatever affects one directly affects all indirectly Never again can we afford to live with the narrow provincial outside agitator idea Anyone who lives inside the United States can never be considered an outsider anywhere within its boundsYou deplore the demonstrations taking place in Birmingham But your statement I am sorry to say fails to express a similar concern for the conditions that brought about the demonstrations I am sure that none of you would want to rest content with the superficial kind o f social analysis that deals merely with effects and does not grapple with underlying causes It is unfortunate that demonstrations are taking place in Birmingham but it is evenmore unfortunate that the citys whitepower structure left the Negro community with no alternativeIn any nonviolent campaign there are four basic steps collection o f the facts to determine whether injustices exist negotiation selfpurification and direct action We have gone through all these steps in Birmingham There can be no gainsaying the fact that racial injustice engulfs this community Birmingham is probably the most thoroughly segregated city in the United States Its ugly record o f brutality is widely known Negroes have experienced grossly unjust treatment in the courts There have been more unsolved bombings of Negro homesmarxmarxmarxand churches in Birmingham than in any other city in the nation These are the hard brutal facts of the case On the basis o f these conditions Negro leaders sought to negotiate with the city fathers But the latter consistently refused to engage in good faith negotiationThen last September came the opportunity to talk with leaders o f Birminghams economic community In the course o f the negotiations certain promises were made by the merchants   for example to remove the stores humiliating racial signs On the basis o f these promises the Reverend Fred Shuttlesworth and the leaders o f the Alabama Christian Movement for Human Rights agreed to a moratorium on all demonstrations As the weeks and months went by we realized that we were the victims o f a broken promise A few signs briefly removed returned the others remained As in so many past experiences our hopes had been blasted and the shadow of deep disappointment settled upon us We had no alternative except to prepare for direct action whereby we would present our very bodies as a means o f laying our case before the conscience o f the local and the national community Mindful o f the difficulties involved we decided to undertake a process o f selfpurification We began a series o f workshops on nonviolence and we repeatedly asked ourselves Are you able to accept blows without retaliating Are youmarxable to endure the ordeal of jail We decided to schedule our direct action program for the Easter season realizing that except for Christmas this is the main shopping period o f the year Knowing that a strong economic withdrawal program would be the byproduct of direct action we felt that this would be the best time to bring pressure to bear on the merchants for the needed changeThen it occurred to us that Birminghams mayoral election was coming up in March and we speedily decided to postpone actionuntil after election day When we discovered that the Commissioner of Public Safety Eugene Bull Connor had piled up enough votes to be in the run off we decided again to postpone action until the day after the run off so that the demonstrations could not be used to cloud the issues Like many others we waited to see Mr Connor defeated and to this end we endured postponement after postponement Having aided in this community need we felt that our direct action program could be delayed no longerYou may well ask W hy direct action W hy sitins marches and so forth Isnt negotiation a better path You are quite right in calling for negotiation Indeed this is the very purpose o f direct action Nonviolent direct action seeks to create such a crisis and foster such a tension that a community which has constantly  refused to negotiate is forced to confront the issue It seeks so tomarxmarxdramatize the issue that it can no longer be ignored My citing the creation of tension as part o f the work o f the nonviolent resister may sound rather shocking But I must confess that I am not afraid o f the word tension I have earnestly opposed violent tension but there is a type o f constructive nonviolent tension which is necessary for growth Just as Socrates felt that it was necessary to create a tension in the mind so that individuals could rise from the bondage o f myths and halftruths to the unfettered realm o f creative analysis and objective appraisal so must we see the need for nonviolent gadflies to create the kind of tension in society that will help men rise from the dark depths o f prejudice and racism to the majestic heights o f understanding and brotherhood The purpose o f our direct action program is to create a situation so crisispacked that it will inevitably open the door to negotiation I therefore concur with you in your call for negotiation Too long has our beloved Southland been bogged down in a tragic effort to live in monologue rather than dialogueOne of the basic points in your statement is that the action that I and my associates have taken in Birmingham is untimely Some have asked W hy didnt you give the new city administration time to act The only answer that I can give to this query is that the new Birmingham administration must be prodded about as much as themarxmarxmarxoutgoing one before it will act We are sadly mistaken if we feel that the election o f Albert Boutwell as mayor will bring the millennium to Birmingham While Mr Bout well is a much more gentle person than Mr Connor they are both segregationists dedicated to maintenance o f the status quo I have hope that Mr Boutwell will be reasonable enough to see the futility o f massive resistance to desegregation But he will not see this without pressure from devotees of civil rights My friends I must say to you that we have not made a single gain in civil rights without determined legal and nonviolent pressure Lamentably it is an historical fact that privileged groups seldom give up their privileges voluntarily Individuals may see the moral light and voluntarily give up their unjust posture but as Reinhold Niebuhr has reminded us groups tend to be more immoral than individualsWe know through painful experience that freedom is never voluntarily given by the oppressor it must be demanded by the oppressed Frankly I have yet to engage in a direct action campaign that was well timed in the view of those who have not suffered unduly from the disease of segregation For years now I have heard the word Wait It rings in the ear o f every Negro with piercing familiarity This Wait has almost always meant Never We must come to see with one o f our distinguished jurists that justice too long delayed is justice deniedmarxmarxmarxWe have waited for more than 340 years for our constitutional and Godgiven rights The nations of Asia and Africa are moving with jetlike speed toward gaining political independence but we still creep at horse and buggy pace toward gaining a cup o f coffee at a lunch counter Perhaps it is easy for those who have never felt the slinging darts of segregation to say Wait But when you have seen vicious mobs lynch your mothers and fathers at will and drown your sisters and brothers at whim when you have seen hatefilled policemen curse kick and even kill your black brothers and sisters when you see the vast majority of your twenty million Negro brothers smothering in an airtight cage o f poverty in the midst o f an affluent society when you suddenly find your tongue twisted and your speech stammering as you seek to explain to your sixyearold daughter why she cant go to the public amusement park that has just been advertised on television and see tears welling up in her eyes when she is told that Funtown is closed to colored children and see ominous clouds o f inferiority beginning to form in her litde mental sky and see her beginning to distort her personality by developing an unconscious bitterness toward white people when you have to concoct an answer for a fiveyearold son who is asking Daddy why do white people treat colored people so mean when you take a crosscounty drive and findunjust I would be the first to advocate obeying just laws One has not only a legal but a moral responsibility to obey just laws Conversely one has a moral responsibility to disobey unjust laws I would agree with St Augustine that fan unjust law is no law at allNow what is the difference between the two How does one determine whether a law is just o r unjust A just law is a manmade code that squares with the moral law or the law of God An unjust law is a code that is out o f harmony with the moral law To put it in the terms o f St Thomas Aquinas an unjust law  is a human law that is not rooted in eternal law and natural law Any law that uplifts human personality is just Any law that degrades human personality is unjust All segregation statutes are unjust because segregation distorts the soul and damages the personality It gives the segregator a false sense of superiority and the segregated a false sense o f inferiority Segregation to use the terminology of the Jewish philosopher Martin Buber substitutes an l it relationship for an T thou relationship and ends up relegating persons to the status o f things Hence segregation is not only politically economically and sociologically unsound it is morally wrong and sinful Paul Tillich has said that sin is separation Is not segregation an existential expression o f mans tragic separation his awful estrangement his terrible sinfulness Thus it is that I canmarxmarxmarxmarxit necessary to sleep night after night in the uncomfortable comers o f your automobile because no motel will accept you when you are humiliated day in and day out by nagging signs reading white and colored when your firstname becomes nigger your middle name becomes boy however old you areandyour last name becomes John and your wife and mother are never given the respected title Mrs when you are harried by day and haunted by night by the fact that you are a Negro living constandy at tiptoe stance never quite knowing what to expect next and are plagued with inner fears and outer resentments when you are forever fighting a degenerating sense o f nobodiness  then you will understand why we find it difficult to wait There comes a time when the cup of endurance runs over and men are no longer willing to be plunged into the abyss o f despair I hope sirs you can understand our legitimate and unavoidable impatience You express a great deal o f anxiety over our willingness to break laws This is certainly a legitimate concern Since we so diligently urge people to obey the Supreme Courts decision o f 1954 outlawing segregation in the public schools at first glance it m ay seem rather paradoxical for us consciously to breaklaws One may well ask How can you advocate breakingsome laws and obeying others The answer lies in the fact that there are two types o f laws just andmarxmarxurge men to obey the 1954 decision of the Supreme C ourt for it is morally right and I can urge them to disobey segregation ordinances for they are morally wrongLet us consider a more concrete example o f just and unjust laws An unjust law is a code that a numerical or power majority group compels a minority group to obey but does not make binding on itself This is difference made legal By the same token a just law is a code that a majority compels a minority to follow and that it is willing to follow itself This is sameness made legal Let me give another explanation A law is unjust if  it is inflicted on a minority that as a result o f being denied the right to vote had no part in enacting or devising the law Who can say that the legislature o f Alabama which set up that states segregation laws was democratically elected Throughout Alabama all sorts of devious methods are used to prevent Negroes from becoming registered voters and there are some counties in which even though Negroes constitute a majority o f the population not a single Negro is registered Can any law enacted under such circumstances be considered democratically structuredSometimes a law is just on its face and unjust in its application For instance I have been arrested on a charge o f parading without a permit Now there is nothing wrong in having an ordinance which requires amarxmarxmarxpermit for a parade But such an ordinance becomes unjust when it is used to maintain segregation and to deny citizens the First Amendment privilege of peaceful assembly and protestI hope you are able to see the distinction I am trying to point out In no sense do I advocate evading or defying the law as would the rabid segregationist That would lead to anarchy One who breaks an unjust law must do so openly lovingly and with a willingness to accept the penalty I submit thatan individual who breaks a law that conscience tells him is unjust and who willingly accepts the penalty of imprisonment in order to arouse the conscience o f the community over its injustice is in reality expressing the highest respect for lawO f course there is nothing new about this kind o f civil disobedience It was evidenced sublimely in the refusal o f Shadrach Meshach and Abednego to obey the laws o f Nebuchadnezzar on the grourid that a higher moral law was at stake It was practised superbly by the early Christians who were willing to face hungry lions and the excruciating pain o f chopping blocks rather than submit to certain unjust laws of the Roman Empire To a degree academic freedom is a reality today because Socrates practised civil disobedience In our own nation the Boston Tea Party represented a massive act o f civil disobediencemarxWe should never forget that everything Adolf Hitler did in Germany was legal and everything the Hungarian freedom fighters did in Hungary was illegal It was illegal to aid and comfort a Jew in Hitlers Germany Even so I am sure that had I lived in Germany at the time I would have aided and comforted m y Jewish brothers If today I lived in a Communist country where certain principles dear to die Christian faith are suppressed I would openly advocate disobeying that countrys antireligious lawsI must make two honest confessions to you my Christian and Jewish brothers First I must confess that over the past few years I have been gravely disappointed with the white moderate I have almost reached the regrettable conclusion that the Negros great stumbling block in his stride toward freedom is not the White Citizens Counciler or the Ku Klux Klanner but the white moderate who is more devoted to order than to justice who prefers a negative peace which is the absence o f tension to a positive peace which is the presence of justice who constantly says I agree with you in the goal you seek but I cannot agree with your methods of direct action who patemalistically believes he can set the timetable for another mans freedom w ho lives by  mythical concept of time and who constantly advises the Negro to wait for a more convenient season Shallowmarxmarxunderstanding from people of good will is more frustrating than absolute misunderstanding from people o f ill will Lukewarm acceptance is much more bewildering than outright rejectionI had hoped that the white moderate would understand that law and order exist for the purpose of establishing justice and that when they fail in this purpose they become the dangerously structured dams that block the flow of social progress I had hoped that the white moderate would understand that the present tension in the South is a necessary phase o f the transition from an obnoxious negative peace in which the Negro passively accepted his unjust plight to a substantive and positive peace in which all men will respect the dignity and worth of human personality Actually w ewho engage in nonviolent direct action are not the creators o f tension We merely bring to the surface the hidden tension that is already alive We bring it out in the open where it can be seen and dealt with Like a boil that can never be cured so long as it is covered up but must be opened with all its ugliness to the natural medicines o f air and light injustice must be exposed with all the tension its exposure creates to the light o f human conscience and the air o f national opinion before it can be curedIn your statement you assert that our actions evenmarxmarxthough peaceful must be condemned because they precipitate violence But is this a logical assertion Isnt this like condemning a robbed man because his possession of money precipitated the evil act o f robbery Isnt this like condemning Socrates because his unswerving commitment to truth and his philosophical inquiries precipitated the act by the misguided populace in which they made him drink hemlock Isnt this like condemning Jesus because his unique God consciousness and never ceasing devotion to Gods will precipitated the evil act of crucifixion We must come to see that as the federal courts have consistently affirmed it is wrong to urge an individual to cease his efforts to gain his basic constitutional rights because the quest may precipitate violence Society must protect the robbed and punish the robber I had also hoped that the white moderate would reject the myth concerning time in relation to the struggle for freedom I have just received a letter from a white brother in Texas He writes All Christians know that the colored people will receive equal rights eventually but it is possible that you are in too great a religious hurry It has taken Christianity almost tw o thousand years to accomplish what it has The teachings o f Christ take time to come to earth Such an attitude stems from a tragic misconception o f time from the strangelymarxmarxmarxirrational notion that there is something in the very flow of time that will inevitably cure all ills Actually time itself is neutral it can be used either destructively or constructively More and more I feel that the people of ill will have used lime much more effectively than have the people of good will We will have to repent in this generation not merely for the hateful words and actions o f the bad people but for the appalling silence of the good people Human progress never rolls in on wheels o f inevitability it comes through the tireless efforts o f men willing to be coworkers with God andwithoutthis hard work time itself becomes an ally o f the forces of social stagnation We must use time creatively in the knowledge that the time is always ripe to do right Now is the time to make real the promise of democracy and transform our pending national elegy into a creative psalm of brotherhood Now is the time to lift our national policy from the quicksand o f racial injustice to the solid rock o f human dignityYou speak of our activity in Birmingham as extreme At first I was rather disappointed that fellow clergymen would see my nonviolent efforts as those of an extremist I began thinking about the fact that I stand in the middle o f two opposing forces in the Negro community One is a force o f complacency made up in part o f Negroes who as a result of long years of oppression aremarxmarxso drained o f selfrespect and a sense o f somebodiness that they have adjusted to segregation and in part o f a few middleclass Negroes who because of a degree of academic and economic security and because in some ways they profit by segregation have become insensitive to the problems o f the masses The other force is one of bitterness and hatred and it comes perilously close to advocating violence It is expressed in the various black nationalist groups that are springing up across the nation the largest and best known being Elijah Muhammads Muslim movement Nourished by the Negros frustration over the continued existence o f racial discrimination this movement is made up o f people who have lost faith in America who have absolutely repudiated Christianity and who have concluded that the white man is an incorrigible devil I have tried to stand between these two forces saying that we need emulate neither the do nothingism o f the complacent nor the hatred and despair o f the black nationalist For there is the more excellent way of love and nonviolent protest I am grateful to God that through the influence of the Negro church the w ay o f nonviolence became an integral part of our struggle If this philosophy had not emerged by now  many streets o f the South would I am convinced be flowing with blood And I am further convinced that if our whitebrothers dismiss as rabble rousers and outside agitators those o f us who employ nonviolent direct action and if  they refuse to support our nonviolent efforts millions o f Negroes will out o f frustration and despair seek solace and security in black nationalist ideologies   a development that would inevitably lead to a frightening racial nightmareOppressed people cannot remain oppressed forever The yearning for freedom eventually manifests itself and that is what has happened to the American Negro Something within has reminded him o f his birthright o f freedom and something without has reminded him that it can be gained Consciously or unconsciously he has been caught up by the Zeitgeist and with his black brothers o f Africa and his brown and yellow brothers o f Asia South America and the Caribbean the United States Negro is moving with a sense o f great urgency toward the promised land of racial justice If one recognizes this vital urge that has engulfed the Negro community one should readily understand why public demonstrations are taking place The Negro has many pentup resentments and latent frustrations and he must release them So let him march let him make prayer pilgrimages to the city hall let him go on freedom rides   and try to understand why he must do so If his repressed emotions are not released in nonviolent ways they w ill seekmarxmarxexpression through violence this is not a threat but a fact of history So I have not said to my people Get rid o f your discontent Rather I have tried to say that this normal and healthy discontent can be channeled into the creative outlet of nonviolent direct action And now this approach is being termed extremist But though I was initially disappointed at being categorized as an extremist as I continued to think about the matter I gradually gained a measure of satisfaction from the label Was not Jesus an extremist for love Love your enemies bless them that curse you do good to them that hate you and pray for them which despitefully use you and persecute you Was not Amos an extremist for justice Let justice roll down like waters and righteousness like an ever flowing stream Was not Paul an extremist for the Christian gospel I bear in my body the marks of the Lord Jesus Was not Martin Luther an extremist Here I stand I cannot do otherwise so help me God And John Bunyan I will stay in jail to the end o f my days before I make a butchery o f my conscience And Abraham Lincoln This nation cannot survive half slave and half free And Thomas Jefferson We hold these truths to be self evident that all men are created equal   So the question is not whether we will be extremists but what kind o f extremists we will be W ill we be extremists for hate or for love W ill we be extremists for the preservation o fmarxinjustice or for the extension o f justice In that dramatic scene on Calvarys hill three men were crucified We must never forget that all three were crucified for the same crime   the crime o f extremism Two were extremists for immorality and thus fell below their environment The other Jesus Christ was an extremist for love truth and goodness and thereby rose above his environment Perhaps the South the nation and the worldare in dire need of creative extremistsI had hoped that the white moderate would see this need Perhaps I was too optimistic perhaps I expected too much I suppose I should have realized that few members o f the oppressor race can understand the deep groans and passionate yearnings o f the oppressed race and still fewer have the vision to see that injustice must be rooted out by strong persistent and determined action I am thankful however that some of our white brothers in the South have grasped the meaning o f this social revolution and committed themselves to it They are still all too few in quantity but they are bigin quality Some   such as Ralph McGill Lillian Smith Harry Golden James McBride Dabbs Ann Braden and Sarah Patton Boyle   have written about our struggle in eloquent and prophetic terms Others have marched with us down nameless streets o f the South They have languished in filthy roachinfested jails suffering the abusemarxand brutality o f policemen who view  them as dirty niggerlovers  Unlike so many o f their moderate brothers and sisters they have recognized the urgency o f the moment and sensed the need for powerful action antidotes to combat the disease o f segregation Let me take note o f my other major disappointment I have been so greatly disappointed with the white church and its leadership O f course there are some notable exceptions I am not unmindful o f the feet that each o f you has taken some significant stands on this issue I commend you Reverend Stallings for your Christian stand on this past Sunday in welcoming Negroes to your worship service on a nonsegregated basis I commend the Catholic leaders of this state for integrating Spring Hill College several years agoBut despite these notable exceptions I must honestly reiterate that I have been disappointed with the church I do not say this as one o f those negative critics who can always find something wrong with the church I say this as a minister o f the gospel who loves the church who was nurtured in its bosom who has been sustained by its spiritual blessings and who will remain true to it as long as the cord o f life shall lengthenWhen I was suddenly catapulted into the leadership o f the bus protest in Montgomery Alabama a few years ago I felt we would be supported by the white churchI felt that the white ministers priests and rabbis of die South would be among our strongest allies Instead some have been outright opponents refusing to understand the freedom movement and misrepresenting its leaders all too many others have been more cautious than courageous and have remained silent behind the anaesthetizing security o f stained glass windowsIn spite o f my shattered dreams I came to Birmingham with the hope that the white religious leadership o f this community would see the justice of our cause and with deep moral concern would serve as the channel through which our just grievances could reach the power structure I had hoped that each o f you would understand But again I have been disappointedI have heard numerous southern religious leaders admonish their worshipers to comply with a desegregation decision because it is the law but I have longed to hear white ministers declare Follow this decree because integration is morally right and because the Negro is your brother In the midst o f blatant injustices inflicted upon the Negro I have watched white churchmen stand on the sideline and mouth pious irrelevancies and sanctimonious trivialities In the midst o f a mighty struggle to rid our nation o f racial and economic injustice I have heard many ministers say Those are social issues with which the gospel has no real concern And I havewatched many churches commit themselves to a completely otherworldly religion which makes a strange unBiblical distinction between body and soul between the sacred and the secularI have traveled the length and breadth o f Alabama Mississippi and all the other southemstates On sweltering summer days and crisp autumn mornings I have looked at the Souths beautiful churches with their lofty spires pointing heavenward I have beheld the impressive outlines o f her massive religious education buildings Over and over I have found myself asking W hat kind o f people worship here W ho is their God Where were their voices when the lips o f Governor Barnett dripped with words o f interposition and nullification Where were they when Governor Wallace gave a clarion call for defiance and hatred Where were their voices o f support when bruised and weary Negro men and women decided to rise from the dark dungeons of complacency to the bright hills o f creative protestYes these questions are still in my mind In deep disappointment I have wept over the laaity o f the church But be assured that my tears have been tears of love There can be no deep disappointment where there is not deep love Yes I love the church How could I do otherwise I am in the rather unique position o f being the son the grandson and the greatgrandson of preachers Yes I seemarxmarxthe church as the body of Christ But oh How we have blemished and scarred that body through social neglect and through fear of being nonconformistsThere was a time when the church was very powerful   in the time when the early Christians rejoiced at being deemed worthy to suffer for what they believed In those days the church was not merely a thermometer that recorded the ideas and principles of popular opinion it was a thermostat that transformed the mores o f society Whenever the early Christians entered a town the people in power became disturbed and immediately sought to convict the Christians for being disturbers o f the peace and outside agitators But the Christians pressed on in the conviction that they were a colony o f heaven called to obey God rather than man Small in number they were big in commitment They were too Godintoxicated to be astronomically intimidated By their effort and example they brought an end to such ancient evils as infanticide and gladiatorial contests Things are different now So often the contemporary church is a weak ineffectual voice with an uncertain sound So often it is an archdefender o f the status quo Far from being disturbed by the presence o f the church the power structure of the average community is consoled by the churchs silent   and often even vocal   sanction of things as they areBut the judgment of God is upon the church as never before If today s church does not recapture the sacrificial spirit of the early church it will lose its authenticity forfeit the loyalty o f millions and be dismissed as an irrelevant social club with no meaning for the twentieth century Every day I meet young people whose disappointment with the church has turned into outright disgustPerhaps I have once again been too optimistic Is organized religion too inextricably bound to the status quo to save our nation and the world Perhaps I must turn m y faith to the inner spiritual church the church within the church as the true ekklesia and the hope o f the world But again I am thankful to God that some noble souls from the ranks o f organized religion have broken loose from the paralyzing chains o f conformity and joined us as active partners in the struggle for freedom They have left their secure congregations and walked the streets o f Albany Georgia with us They have gone down the highways o f the South on tortuous rides for freedom Yes they have gone to jail with us Some have been dismissed from their churches have lost the support o f their bishops and fellow ministers But they have acted in the faith that right defeated is stronger than evil triumphant Their witness has been the spirmarxitual salt that has preserved the true meaning o f the gospel in these troubled limes They have carved a tunnel of hope through the dark mountain o f disappointment I hope the church as a whole will meet the challenge of this decisive hour But even if the church does not come to the aid o f justice I have no despair about the future I have no fear about the outcome o f our struggle in Birmingham even if  our motives are at present misunderstood W e will reach the goal o f freedom  in Birmingham and all over the nation because the goal o f America is freedom Abused and scorned though we may be our destiny is tied up with Americas destiny Before the pilgrims landed at Plymouth we were here Before the pen o f Jefferson etched the majestic words o f the Declaration o f Independence across the pages o f history we w ere here For more than tw o centuries our forebears labored in this country without wages they made cotton king they built the homes o f their masters while suffering gross injustice and shameful humiliation   and yet out o f a bottomless vitality they continued to thrive and develop If the inexpressible cruelties o f slavery could not stop us the opposition w e now  face w ill surely fail We will win our freedom because the sacred heritage o f our nation and the eternal will o f God are embodied in our echoing demands Before closing I feel impelled to mention one other point in your statemarxmarxment that has troubled me profoundly You warm ly commended the Birmingham police force for keeping order and preventing violence I doubt that you would have so warm ly commended the police force if  you had seen its dogs sinking their teeth into unarmed nonviolent Negroes I doubt that you would so quickly commend the policemen if you were to observe their ugly and inhumane treatment o f Negroes here in the city j ail if you were to watch them push and curse old Negro women and young Negro girls if y ou were to see them slap and kick old Negro men and young boys if you were to observe them as they did on two occasions refuse to give us food because we wanted to sing our grace together I cannot join you in your praise o f the Birmingham police departmentIt is true that the police have exercised a degree of discipline in handling the demonstrators In this sense they have conducted themselves rather nonviolently in public But for what purpose To preserve the evil system  o f segregation Over the past few years I have consistently preached that nonviolence demands that the means we use must be as pure as the ends we seek I have tried to make clear that it is wrong to use immoral means to attain moral ends But now I must affirm that it is just as w rong or perhaps even more so to use moral means to preserve immoral ends Perhaps Mr Connor and hismarxpolicemen have been rather nonviolent in public as was Chief Pritchett in Albany Georgia but they have used the m oral means o f nonviolence to maintain the immoral end o f racial injustice As T S Eliot has said T h e  last temptation is the greatest treason To do the right deed for the wrong reasonI wish you had commended the Negro sitinners and demonstrators o f Birmingham for their sublime courage their willingness to suffer and their amazing discipline in the midst o f great provocation One day the South will recognize its real heroes They will be the James Merediths with the noble sense o f purpose that enables them to face jeering and hostile mobs and with the agonizing loneliness that characterizes the life o f the pioneer They will be old oppressed battered Negro women symbolized in a seventytwoyearold woman in Montgomery Alabama who rose up with a sense o f dignity and w ith her people decided not to ride segregated buses and who responded with ungrammatical profundity to one who inquired about her weariness My feets is tired but my soul is at rest They will be the young high school and college students the young ministers o f the gospel and ahostof their elders courageously and nonviolently sittingin at lunch counters and willingly going to jail for conscience sake One day the South w ill know that when these disinherited childrenmarxo f God sat down at lunch counters they were in reality standing up for what is best in the American dream and for the most sacred values in our JudaeoChristian heritage thereby bringing our nation back to those great wells of democracy which were dug deep by the founding fathers in their formulation o f the Constitution and the Declaration of IndependenceNever before have I written so long a letter Im afraid it is much too long to take your precious time I can assure you that it would have been much shorter if I had been writing from a comfortable desk but what else can one do when he is alone in a narrow jail cell other than write long letters think long thoughts and pray long prayersIf I have said anything in this letter that overstates the truth and indicates an unreasonable impatience I beg you to forgive me If I have said anything that understates the truth and indicates my having a patience that allows me to settle for anything less than brotherhood I beg God to forgive meI hope this letter finds you strong in the faith I also hope that circumstances will soon make it possible for me to meet each of you not as an integrationist or a civil rights leader but as a fellow clergyman and a Christian brother Let us all hope that the dark clouds o f racial prejudice w ill soon pass away and the deep fog o fmisunderstanding will be lifted from our feardrenched communities and in some not too distant tomorrow the radiant stars of love and brotherhood will shine over our great nation with all their scintillating beautyYours for the cause o f Peace and BrotherhoodMartin Luther King JrThe Three Dimensions o f a Complete LifeI want to use as the subject from which to preach T h e Three Dimensions of a Complete Life You know they used to tell us in Hollywood that in order for a movie to be complete it had to be threedimensional Well this morning I want to seek to get over to each o f us that if life itself is to be complete it must be threedimensionalMany many centuries ago there was a man by the name o f John who found himself in prison out on a lonely obscure island called Patmos And Ive been in prison just enough to know that its a lonely experience And when you are incarcerated in such a situation you are deprived o f almost every freedom but the freedom to think the freedom to pray the freedom to reflect and to meditate And while John was out on this lonely island in prison he lifted his vision to high heaven and he saw descending out o f heaven a new heaven and a new earth Over in the twentyfirst chapter o f the book of Revelation it opens by saying And I saw a new heaven3iand a new earth And I John saw the holy dty the new Jerusalem coming down from God out o f heavenAnd one o f the greatest glories o f this new d ty of God that John saw was its completeness It was not up on one side and down on the other but it was complete in all three of its dimensions And so in this same chapter as we looked down to the sixteenth verse John says The length and the breadth and the height of it are equal In other words this new dty o f God this new d ty o f ideal humanity is not an unbalanced entity but is complete on all sides Now I think John is saying something here in all of the symbolism of this text and the symbolism o f this chapter Hes saying at bottom that life as it should be and life at its best is a life that is complete on all sidesAnd there are three dimensions o f any complete life to which we can fidy give the words o f this text length breadth and height Now the length of life as we shall use it here is the inward concern for ones own welfare In other words it is that inward concern that causes one to push forward to achieve his own goals and ambitions The breadth o f life as we shall use it here is the outward concern for the welfare of others And the height of life is the upward reach for God N ow  you got to have all three o f these to have a complete lifeNow lets turn for the moment to the length o f life I said that this is the dimension o f life where we areconcerned with developing our inner powers In a sense this is the selfish dimension o f life There is such a thing as rational and healthy selfinterest A great Jewish rabbi the late Joshua Leibman wrote a book some years ago entitled Peace of Mind And he has a chapter in that book entitled Love Thyself Properly  And what he says in that chapter in substance is that before you can love other selves adequately youve got to love your own self properly You know a lot o f people dont love themselves And they go through life with deep and haunting emotional conflicts So the length o f life means that you must love yourselfAnd you know what loving yourself also means It means that youve got to accept yourself So many people are busy trying to be somebody else God gave all o f us something significant And we must pray every day asking God to help us to accept ourselves That means everything Too many Negroes are ashamed o f themselves ashamed of being black A Negro got to rise up and say from the bottom of his soul I am somebody I have a rich noble and proud heritage However exploited and however painful my history has been Im black but Im black and beautiful This is what weve got to say Weve got to accept ourselves And we must prayLord Help me to accept myself every day help me to accept my toolsI remember when I was in college I majored in sociology and all sociology majors had to take a course that was required called statistics And statistics can be very complicated youve got to have a mathematical mind a real knowledge o f geometry and youve got to know how to find the mean the mode and the median I never will forget I took this course and I had a fellow classmate who could just work that stuff out you know And he could do his homework in about an hour We would often go to the lab or the workshop and he would just work it out in about an hour and it was over for him And I was trying to do what he was doing I was trying to do mine in an hour And the more I tried to do it in an hour the more I was flunking out in the course And I had to come to a very hard conclusion I had to sit down and say Now Martin Luther King Leif Cane has a better mind than you Sometimes you have to acknowledge that And I had to say to myself Now he may be able to do it in an hour but it takes me two or three hours to do it I was not willing to accept myself I was not willing to accept my tools and my limitationsBut you know in life w ere called upon to do this A Ford car trying to be a Cadillac is absurd but if a Ford will accept itself as a Ford it can do many things that a Cadillac could never do it can get in parking spaces that a Cadillac can never get in And in life some o f us areFords and some of us are Cadillacs Moses says in Green Pastures Lord I aint much but I is all I got The principle of selfacceptance is a basic principle in lifeNow the other thing about the length o f life after accepting ourselves and our tools we must discover what we are called to do And once we discover it we should set out to do it with all of the strength and all o f the power that we have in our systems And after weve discovered what God called us to do after weve discovered our lifes work we should set out to do that work so well that the living the dead or the unborn couldnt do it any better Now this does not mean that everybody w ill do the socalled big recognized things o f life Very few people will rise to the heights of genius in the arts and the sciences very few collectively will rise to certain professions Most of us will have to be content to work in the fields and in the factories and on the streets But we must see the dignity of all laborW hen I was in Montgomery Alabama I went to a shoe shop quite often known as the Gordon Shoe Shop And there was a fellow in there that used to shine my shoes and it was just an experience to witness this fellow shining my shoes He would get that rag you know and he could bring music out of it And I said to myself This fellow has a PhD in shoe shiningW hat Im saying to you this morning my friendseven if it falls your lot to be a street sweeper go on out and sweep streets like Michelangelo painted pictures sweep streets like Handel and Beethoven composed music sweep streets like Shakespeare wrote poetry sweep streets so well that all the host o f heaven and earth w ill have to pause and say Here lived a great street sweeper who swept his job wellIf you cant be a pine on the top of a hillBe a scrub in the valley   but beThe best little scrub on the side of the hillBe a bush if you cant be a treeIf you cant be a highway just be a trail If you cant be the sun be a starIt isnt by size that you win or fail   Be the best of whatever you areAnd when you do this when you do this youve mastered the length o f lifeThis onward push to die end o f selffulfillment is the end o f a persons life Now dont stop here though You know a lot o f people get no further in life than the length They develop their inner powers they do their jobs well But do you know they try to live as if  nobody else lives in the world but themselves And they use everybody as mere tools to get to where theyre going They dont love anybody but themselves And the only kindof love that they really have for other people is utilitarian love You know they just love people that they can useA lot o f people never get beyond the first dimension of life They use other people as mere steps by which they can climb to their goals and their ambitions These people dont work out w ell in life They may go for awhile they may think theyre making it all right but there is a law They call it the law of gravitation in the physical universe and it works its final its inexorable whatever goes up can come down You shall reap what you sow God has structured the universe that way And he who goes through life not concerned about others will be a subject a victim o f this lawSo I move on and say that it is necessary to add breadth to length Now the breadth of life is the outward concern for the welfare o f others as I said And a man has not begun to live until he can rise above the narro w  confines o f his own individual concerns to the broader concerns o f all humanityOne day Jesus told a parable You will remember that parable He had a man that came to him to talkwithhim  about some very profound concerns And they finally got around to the question Who is my neighbor And this man wanted to debate with Jesus This question could have very easily ended up in thin air as a theological or philosophical debate But you remember Jesusimmediately pulled that question out o f thin air and placed it on a dangerous curve between Jerusalem and Jericho He talked about a certain man who fell among thieves Two men came by and they just kept going And then finally another man came a member o f another race w ho stopped and helped him And that parable ends up saying that this good Samaritan was a great man he was a good man because he was concerned about more than himselfNow you know there are many ideas about why the priest and the Levite passed and didnt stop to help that man A lot of ideas about it Some say that they were going to a church service and they were running a little late you know and couldnt be late for church so they kept going because they had to get down to the synagogue And then there are others who would say that they were involved in the priesthood and consequently there was a priestly law which said that if you were going to administer the sacrament or what have you you couldnt touch a human body twentyfour hours before worship Now theres another possibility It is possible that they were going down to Jericho to organize a Jericho Road Improvement Association Thats another possibility And they may have passed by because they felt that it was better to deal with the problem from the causal source rather than one individual victim Thats a possibilityBut you kno w when I think about this parable I think o f another possibility as I use my imagination Its possible that these men passed by on the other side because they were afraid You know the Jericho Road is a dangerous road Ive been on it and I know And I never w ill forget Mrs King and I were in the Holy Land some time ago We rented a car and we drove fromjerusalemdown to Jericho a distance of about sixteen miles You get on that Jericho road   Im telling you its a winding curving meandering road very conducive for robbery And I said to my wife N ow  I can see why Jesus used this road as the occasion for his parable Here you are when you start out in Jerusalem you are twentytwo hundred feet above sea level and when you get down to Jericho sixteen miles later   I mean you have sixteen miles from Jerusalem   youre twelve hundred feet below sea level During the days of Jesus that road came to the point of being known as the Bloody Path So when I think about the priest and the Levite I think those brothers were afraidThey were just like me I was going out to my fathers house in Atlanta the other day He lives about three or four miles from me and you go out there by going down Simpson Road And then when I came back later that night   and brother I can teU you Simpson Road is a winding road And a fellow was standing out theretrying to flag me down And I felt that he needed some help I knew he needed help But I didnt know it Til be honest with you I kept going I wasnt really willing to take the riskI say to you this morning that the first question that the priest asked was the first question that I asked on that Jericho Road of Atlanta known as Simpson Road The first question that the Levite asked was T f I stop to help this man what will happen to me But the good Samaritan came by and he reversed the question Not What will happen to me if I stop to help this man but W hat will happen to this man if I do not stop to help him This was w hy that man was good and great He was great because he was willing to take a risk for humanity he was willing to askW hat w ill happen to this man not What will happen to meThis is what God needs today men and women who will ask What will happen to humanity if  I dont help What will happen to the ci vil rights movement if  I dont participate W hat will happen to my city if I dont vote What will happen to the sick if I dont visit them This is how God judges people in the final analysisOh there will be a day the question wont be How many awards did you get in life Not that day It wont be H ow popular were you in your social setting That wont be the question that day It will not ask how manydegrees youve been able to get The question that day will not be concerned with whether you are a PhD or a no D   It will not be concerned with whether you went to Morehouse or whether you went to No House The question that day will not be H ow  beautiful is your house The question that day will not be H ow much money did you accumulate How much did you have in stocks and bonds The question that day will not be W hat kind o f automobile did you have On that day the question will be W hat did you do for othersNow I can hear somebody saying Xord I did a lot of things in life I did my job well the world honored me for doing m y job I did a lot o f things Lord I went to school and studied hard I accumulated a lot o f money Lord thats what I did It seems as if  I can hear the Lord o f Life saying But I was hungry and ye fed me not I was sick and ye visited me not I was naked and ye clothed me not I was in prison and you werent concerned about me So get out o f my face What did you do for others This is the breadth of lifeSomewhere along the way we must learn that there is nothing greater than to do something for others And this is the way Ive decided to go the rest of my days Thats what Im concerned about John if you and Bernard happen to be around when I come to the latter daysand that moment to cross the Jordan I want you to tell them that I made a request I don t want a long funeral In fact I dont even need a eulogy more than one or two minutes I hope that I will live so well the rest of the days  1 dont know how long Ill live and Im not com cemed about that   but I hope I can live so well that the preacher can get up and say He was faithful Thats all thats enough Thats the sermon Id like to hear Well done my good and faithful servant Youve been faithful youve been concerned about others Thats where I want to go from this point on for the rest o f my days He who is greatest among you shall be your servant I want to be a servant I want to be a witness for my Lord to do something for othersAnd dont forget in doing something for others that you have what you have because o f others Dont forget that We are tied together in life and in the world And you may think you got all you got by yourself But you know before you got out here to church this morning you were dependent on more than half o f the world You get up in the morning and go to the bathroom and you reach over for a bar o f soap and thats handed to you by a Frenchman You reach over for a sponge and thats given to you by a Turk You reach over for a towel and that comes to your hand from the hands o f a Pacific Islander And then you go on to the kitchen to get yourbreakfast You reach on over to get a little coffee and thats poured in your cup by a South American Or maybe you decide that you want a litde tea this morning only to discover that thats poured in your cup by a Chinese Or maybe you want a little cocoa thats poured in your cup by a West African Then you want a little bread and you reach over to get it and thats given to you by the hands o f an Englishspeaking farmer not to mention the baker Before you get through eating breakfast in the morning youre dependent on more than half the world Thats the way God structured it thats the way God structured this world So let us be concerned about others because we are dependent on othersBut dont stop here either You know a lot o f people master the length o f life and they master the breadth of life but they stop right there Now if  life is to be complete we must move beyond our selfinterest We must move beyond humanity and reach up way up for the God o f the universe whose purpose changeth notNow a lot of people have neglected this third dimension And you know the interesting thing is a lot o f people neglect it and dont even know they are neglecting it They just get involved in other things And you know there are two kinds o f atheism Atheism is the theory that there is no God N ow  one kind is a theoretical kind where somebody just sits down and startsthinking about it and they come to a conclusion that there is no God The other kind is a practical atheism and that kind goes out of living as if there is no God And you know there are a lot of people who affirm the existence of God with their lips and they deny his existence with their lives Youve seen these people who have a high blood pressure of creeds and an anemia of deeds They deny the existence of God with their lives and they just become so involved in other things They become so involved in getting a bigbank account They become so involved in getting a beautiful house which we all should have They become so involved in getting a beautiful car that they unconsciously just forget about God There are those who become so involved in looking at the manmade lights o f the city that they unconsciously forget to rise up and look at that great cosmic lightand think about i t   that gets up in the eastern horizon every morning and moves across the sky with a kind of symphony o f motion and paints its technicolor across the blue   a light that man can never make They become so involved in looking at the skyscraping buildings of the Loop of Chicago or Empire State Building o f New York that they unconsciously forget to think about the gigan tic mountains that kiss the skies as if to bathe their peaks in the lofty blue   something that man could never make They become so busy thinking about radar and theirtelevision that they unconsciously forget to think about the stars that bedeck the heavens like swinging lanterns o f eternity those stars that appear to be shiny silvery pins sticking in the magnificent blue pincushion They become so involved in thinking about mans progress that they forget to think about the need for Gods power in history They end up going days and days not knowing that God is not with themAnd Im here to tell you today that we need God Modem man may know a great deal but his knowledge does not eliminate God And I tell you this morning that God is here to stay A few theologians are trying to say that God is dead And Ive been asking them about it because it disturbs me to know that God died and I didnt have a chance to attend the funeral They havent been able to tell me yet the date o f his death They havent been able to tell me yet who the coroner was that pronounced him dead They havent been able to tell me yet where hes buriedYou see when I think about God I know his name He said somewhere back in the Old Testament T want you to go out Moses and tell them I Am sent you He saidjust to make it dear let them know that my last name is the same as my first I Am that I Am  Make that dear I Am And God is the only being in the universe that can say I Am and put a period behind it Eachof us sitting here has to say 1 am because of my parents I am because o f certain environmental conditions I am because o f certain hereditary circumstances I am because o f God But God is tbe only being tbat can just say I Am and stop right there I Am that I Am  And Hes here to stay Let nobody make us feel that we dont need GodAs I come to my conclusion this morning I want to say that we should search for him We were made for God and we will be restless until we find rest in him And I say to you this morning that this is the personal faith that has kept me going Im not worried about the future You know even on this race question Im not worried I was down in Alabama the other day and I started thinking about the state o f Alabama where we worked so hard and may continue to elect the Wallaces And down in my home state o f Georgia we have another sick governor by the name of Lester Maddox And all o f these things can get you confused but they dont worry me Because the God that I worship is a God that has a way o f saying even to kings and even to governors Be still and know that I am God And God has not yet turned over this universe to Lester Maddox and Lurleen Wallace Somewhere I read The earth is the Lords and the fulness thereof and Im going on because I have faith in Him I do not know what the future holds but Ido know who holds the future And if  Hell guide us and hold our hand well go on inI remember down in Montgomery Alabama an experience that Id like to share with you W hen we were in the midst o f the bus boycott we had a marvelous old lady that we affectionately called Sister Pollard She was a wonderful lady about seventytwo years old and she was still w orking at that age During the boycott she would walk every day to and from work She was one that somebody stopped one day and said Wouldnt you like to ride And she said N o And then the driver moved on and stopped and thought and backed up a little and said Well arent you tired She said Yes my feets is tired but my soul is restedShe was a marvelous lady And one week I can remember that I had gone through a very difficult week Threatening calls had come in all day and all night the night before and I was beginning to falter and to get weak within and to lose my corage And I never w ill forget that I went to the mass meeting that Monday night very discouraged and a litde afraid and wondering whether we were going to win the struggle And I got up to make my talk that night but it didnt come out with strength and power Sister Pollard came up to me after the meeting and said Son whats wrong with you Said You didnt talk strong enough tonightAnd I said Nothing is wrong Sister Pollard Im all rightShe said You cant fool me Said Something wrong with you And then she went on to say these words Is the white folks doing som ething to you that you dont likeI said Everything is going to be all right Sister PollardAnd then she finally said Now come close to me and let me tell you something one more time and I want you to hear it this time She said Now I done told you we is with you She said Now even if  we aint with you the Lord is with you And she concluded by saying The Lords going to take care of youAnd Ive seen many things since that day Ive gone through many experiences since thatnight in Montgomery Alabama Since that time Sister Pollard has died Since that time Ive been in more than eighteen jail cells Since that lime Ive come perilously close to death at the hands o f a demented Negro woman Since that time Ive seen my home bombed three limes Since that lime Ive had to live every day under the threat o f death Since that time Ive had many frustrating and bewildering nights But over and over again I can still hear Sister Pollards words Gods going to take care o f you So today I can face any man and any woman with my feet solidly placedon the ground and my head in the air because I know that when you are right God will fight your batdeDarker yet may be the nightHarder yet may be the fightJust stand up for that which is rightIt seems that I can hear a voice speaking even this morning saying to all o f us Stand up for what is right Stand up for what is just Lo I will be with you even until the end o f the world Yes IVe seen the lightning flash Ive heard the thunder roll Ive felt sinbreakers dashing trying to conquer my soul But I heard the voice o f Jesus saying still to fi ght on He promised never to leave me never to leave me alone No never alone No never alone He promised never to leave me never to leave me alone And I go on in believing that Reach out and find the breadth of lifeYou may not be able to define God in philosophical terms Men through the ages have tried to talk about him Plato said that he was the Architectonic Good Aristotle called him the Unmoved Mover Hegel called him the Absolute Whole Then there was a man named Paul Tillich who called him BeingItself W e dont need to know all o f these highsounding terms Maybe we have to know him and discover him another way One day you ought to rise up and say T know him because hes a lilyof the valley Hes a bright and morning star Hes a rose o f Sharon Hes a battleaxe in the lime o f Babylon And then somewhere you ought to just reach out and say Hes my everything Hes my mother and my father Hes my sister and my brother Hes a friend to the friendless This is the God o f the universe And if  you believe in him and worship him something w ill happen in your life You will smile when others around you are crying This is the power o f G odGo out this morning Love yourself and that means rational and healthy selfinterest You are commanded to do that Thats the length o f life Then follow that Love your neighbor as you love yourself You are commanded to do that Thats the breadth of life And Im going to take my seat now by letting you know that theres a first and even greater commandment Love the Lord thy God with all thy heart with all thy soul with all thy strength I think thepsychologist would just say with all thy personality And when you do that youve got the breadth o f lifeAnd when you get all three o f these together you can walk and never get weary You can look up and see the morning stars singing together and the sons o f God shouting for joy W hen you get all o f these working together in your very life judgement will roll down like waters and righteousness like a mighty streamWhen you get all the three of these together the lamb will lie down with the lionWhen you get all three o f these together you lookup and every valley will be exalted and every hill and mountain will be made low die rough places will be made plain and the crooked places straight and the glory of the Lord shall be revealed and all flesh will see it togetherWhen you get all three o f these working together you will do unto others as youd have them do unto youW hen you get all three o f these together you will recognize that out of one blood God

wherever he goes is encompassed by a cloud of comforting convictions whichmove with him like flies on a summer dayBertrand Russell Preface to the 2006 Edition This is a revised edition of my own favorite among the books I have writtenmainly because it addresses a fundamental question that seldom gets theattention it deserves What are the underlying assumptions behind the verydifferent ideological visions of the world being contested in modern timesThe purpose here will not be to determine which of these visions is morevalid but rather to reveal the inherent logic behind each of these sets ofviews and the ramifications of their assumptions which lead not only todifferent conclusions on particular issues but also to wholly differentmeanings to such fundamental words as justice equality and powerAlthough this is in one sense a book about the history of ideas it is alsovery much about our own times for this conflict of visions is as sharplycontested today as it has been over the past two centuries Two other books of mine do seek to examine the validity of differentvisionsThe Vision of the Anointed and The Quest for Cosmic Justicebutthat is not the task in A Conflict of Visions Together these three booksmight be considered an informal trilogy though each was written to standalone However I cannot claim to have stood alone when preparing thisrevised edition for my two assistants Na Liu and Elizabeth Costa havemade major contributions in ferreting out errors and inconsistencies and inpreparing the computerized work for publication Thomas Sowell  The Hoover Institution  Stanford University  Preface to the 1987 Edition A conflict of visions differs from a conflict between contending interestsWhen interests are at stake the parties directly affected usually understandclearly what the issue is and what they individually stand to gain or loseThe general public may not understandand indeed may be confusedprecisely because of the propaganda of the contending parties But suchpublic confusion is the direct consequence of the clarity of the interestedparties themselves However when there is a conflict of visions those mostpowerfully affected by a particular vision may be the least aware of itsunderlying assumptionsor the least interested in stopping to examine suchtheoretical questions when there are urgent practical issues to beconfronted crusades to be launched or values to be defended at all costs Yet visions are not mere emotional drives On the contrary they have aremarkable logical consistency even if those devoted to these visions haveseldom investigated that logic Nor are visions confined to zealots andideologues We all have visions They are the silent shapers of our thoughts Visions may be moral political economic religious or social In theseor other realms we sacrifice for our visions and sometimes if need be faceruin rather than betray them Where visions conflict irreconcilably wholesocieties may be torn apart Conflicts of interests dominate the short runbut conflicts of visions dominate history We will do almost anything for our visions except think about them Thepurpose of this book is to think about them Thomas Sowell  The Hoover Institution  Stanford University  PART I PATTERNS Chapter 1 The Role of Visions One of the curious things about political opinions is how often the samepeople line up on opposite sides of different issues The issues themselvesmay have no intrinsic connection with each other They may range frommilitary spending to drug laws to monetary policy to education Yet thesame familiar faces can be found glaring at each other from opposite sidesof the political fence again and again It happens too often to becoincidence and it is too uncontrolled to be a plot A closer look at thearguments on both sides often shows that they are reasoning fromfundamentally different premises These different premisesoften implicitare what provide the consistency behind the repeated opposition ofindividuals and groups on numerous unrelated issues They have differentvisions of how the world works It would be good to be able to say that we should dispense with visionsentirely and deal only with reality But that may be the most utopian visionof all Reality is far too complex to be comprehended by any given mindVisions are like maps that guide us through a tangle of bewilderingcomplexities Like maps visions have to leave out many concrete featuresin order to enable us to focus on a few key paths to our goals Visions areindispensablebut dangerous precisely to the extent that we confuse themwith reality itself What has been deliberately neglected may not in fact turnout to be negligible in its effect on the results That has to be tested againstevidence A vision has been described as a preanalytic cognitive act1 It is whatwe sense or feel before we have constructed any systematic reasoning thatcould be called a theory much less deduced any specific consequences ashypotheses to be tested against evidence A vision is our sense of how theworld works For example primitive mans sense of why leaves move mayhave been that some spirit moves them and his sense of why tides rise orvolcanoes erupt may have run along similar lines Newton had a verydifferent vision of how the world works and Einstein still another Forsocial phenomena Rousseau had a very different vision of human causationfrom that of Edmund Burke Visions are the foundations on which theories are built The finalstructure depends not only on the foundation but also on how carefully andconsistently the framework of theory is constructed and how well buttressedit is with hard facts Visions are very subjective but wellconstructedtheories have clear implications and facts can test and measure theirobjective validity The world learned at Hiroshima that Einsteins vision ofphysics was not just Einsteins vision Logic is an essential ingredient in the process of turning a vision into atheory just as empirical evidence is then essential for determining thevalidity of that theory But it is the initial vision which is crucial for ourglimpse of insight into the way the world works In Paretos wordsLogic is useful for proof but almost never for making discoveries Aman receives certain impressions under their influence he stateswithout being able to say either how or why and if he attempts to doso he deceives himselfa proposition which can be verifiedexperimentally2   Visions are all to some extent simplisticthough that is a term usuallyreserved for other peoples visions not our own The everchangingkaleidoscope of raw reality would defeat the human mind by its complexityexcept for the minds ability to abstract to pick out parts and think of themas the whole This is nowhere more necessary than in social visions andsocial theory dealing with the complex and often subconscious interactionsof millions of human beings No matter what vision we build on it will never account for everysparrows fall Social visions especially must leave many importantphenomena unexplained or explained only in ad hoc fashion or byinconsistent assumptions that derive from more than one vision The purestvision may not be the basis of the most impressive theories much less themost valid ones Yet purer visions may be more revealing as to unspokenpremises than are the more complex theories For purposes ofunderstanding the role of visions William Godwins Enquiry ConcerningPolitical Justice 1793 may tell us more than Marxs Capital Indeed wemay understand more of Marxs Capital after we have seen how similarpremises worked out in the less complicated model of William GodwinLikewise the vision of social causation underlying the theories of thePhysiocrats was in its essentials very much like the vision elaborated in amore complex and sophisticated way by Adam Smith and still later andstill more so by Milton Friedman A vision as the term is used here is not a dream a hope a prophecy or amoral imperative though any of these things may ultimately derive fromsome particular vision Here a vision is a sense of causation It is more likea hunch or a gut feeling than it is like an exercise in logic or factualverification These things come later and feed on the raw material providedby the vision If causation proceeds as our vision conceives it to thencertain other consequences follow and theory is the working out of whatthose consequences are Evidence is fact that discriminates between onetheory and another Facts do not speak for themselves They speak for oragainst competing theories Facts divorced from theory or visions are mereisolated curiosities Ultimately there are as many visions as there are human beings if notmore and more than one vision may be consistent with a given factTheories can be devastated by facts but they can never be proved to becorrect by facts Facts force us to discard some theoriesor else to tortureour minds trying to reconcile the irreconcilablebut they can never put thefinal imprimatur of ultimate truth on a given theory What empiricalverification can do is to reveal which of the competing theories currentlybeing considered is more consistent with what is known factually Someother theory may come along tomorrow that is still more consistent with thefacts or explains those facts with fewer clearer or more manageableassumptionsor a new theory may fit both this and other empiricalphenomena hitherto explained by a separate theory Social visions are important in a number of ways The most obvious isthat policies based on a certain vision of the world have consequences thatspread through society and reverberate across the years or even acrossgenerations or centuries Visions set the agenda for both thought and actionVisions fill in the necessarily large gaps in individual knowledge Thus forexample an individual may act in one way in some area in which he hasgreat knowledge but in just the opposite way elsewhere where he isrelying on a vision he has never tested empirically A doctor may be aconservative on medical issues and a liberal on social and political issuesor vice versa The political battles of the day are a potpourri of special interests massemotions personality clashes corruption and numerous other factors Yetthe enduring historic trends have a certain consistency that reflects certainvisions Often special interests prevail to the extent that they can mobilizesupport from the general publics responsiveness to visions which can beinvoked for or against a given policy From the standpoint of personalmotivation ideas may be simply the chips with which special interestsdemagogues and opportunists of various sorts play the political game Butfrom a broader perspective of history these individuals and organizationscan be viewed as simply carriers of ideas much as bees inadvertently carrypollenplaying a vital role in the grand scheme of nature while pursuing amuch narrower individual purpose The role of rationally articulated ideas may be quite modest in its effecton a given election a legislative vote or an action of a head of state Yet theatmosphere in which such decisions take place may be dominated by aparticular visionor by a particular conflict of visions Where intellectualshave played a role in history it has not been so much by whispering wordsof advice into the ears of political overlords as by contributing to the vastand powerful currents of conceptions and misconceptions that sweep humanaction along The effects of visions do not depend upon their beingarticulated or even on decisionmakers being aware of them Practicaldecisionmakers often disdain theories and visions being too busy toexamine the ultimate basis on which they are acting However the objecthere will be precisely to examine the underlying social visions whoseconflicts have shaped our times and may well shape times to come Chapter 2 Constrained and Unconstrained Visions At the core of every moral code there is a picture of human nature a map of the universe anda version of history To human nature of the sort conceived in a universe of the kindimagined after a history so understood the rules of the code applyWalter Lippmann1     Social visions differ in their basic conceptions of the nature of man Acreature from another galaxy who sought information about human beingsfrom reading William Godwins Enquiry Concerning Political Justice in1793 would hardly recognize man as he appears there as the same beingwho was described in The Federalist Papers just five years earlier Thecontrast would be only slightly less if he compared man as he appeared inThomas Paine and in Edmund Burke or today in John Kenneth Galbraithand in Friedrich A Hayek Even the speculative prehistory of man as awild creature in nature differs drastically between the free innocent beingconceived by JeanJacques Rousseau and the brutal participant in thebloody war of each against all conceived by Thomas Hobbes The capacities and limitations of man are implicitly seen in radicallydifferent terms by those whose explicit philosophical political or socialtheories are built on different visions Mans moral and mental natures areseen so differently that their respective concepts of knowledge and ofinstitutions necessarily differ as well Social causation itself is conceiveddifferently both as to mechanics and results Time and its ancillaryphenomenatraditions contracts economic speculation for examplearealso viewed quite differently in theories based on different visions Theabstractions which are part of all theories tend to be viewed as more real byfollowers of some visions than by followers of opposing visions Finallythose who believe in some visions view themselves in a very differentmoral role from the way that followers of other visions view themselvesThe ramifications of these conflicting visions extend into economicjudicial military philosophical and political decisions Rather than attempt the impossible task of following all theseramifications in each of the myriad of social visions the discussion herewill group these visions into two broad categoriesthe constrained visionand the unconstrained vision These will be abstractions of conveniencerecognizing that there are degrees in both visions that a continuum hasbeen dichotomized that in the real world there are often elements of eachinconsistently grafted on to the other and innumerable combinations andpermutations With all these caveats it is now possible to turn to an outlineof the two visions and specifics on the nature of man the nature ofknowledge and the nature of social processes as seen in constrained andunconstrained visions THE NATURE OF MAN The Constrained Vision Adam Smith provided a picture of man which may help make concrete thenature of a constrained vision Writing as a philosopher in 1759 nearlytwenty years before he became famous as an economist Smith said in hisTheory of Moral SentimentsLet us suppose that the great empire of China with all its myriads ofinhabitants was suddenly swallowed up by an earthquake and let usconsider how a man of humanity in Europe who had no sort ofconnection with that part of the world would react upon receivingintelligence of this dreadful calamity He would I imagine first of allexpress very strongly his sorrow for the misfortune of that unhappypeople he would make many melancholy reflections upon theprecariousness of human life and the vanity of all the labours of manwhich could thus be annihilated in a moment He would too perhapsif he was a man of speculation enter into many reasonings concerningthe effects which this disaster might produce upon the commerce ofEurope and the trade and business of the world in general And whenall this fine philosophy was over when all these humane sentimentshad been once fairly expressed he would pursue his business or hispleasure take his repose or his diversion with the same ease andtranquility as if no such accident had happened The most frivolousdisaster which could befall himself would occasion a more realdisturbance If he was to lose his little finger tomorrow he would notsleep tonight but provided he never saw them he would snore withthe most profound security over the ruin of a hundred million of hisbrethren   2   The moral limitations of man in general and his egocentricity inparticular were neither lamented by Smith nor regarded as things to bechanged They were treated as inherent facts of life the basic constraint inhis vision The fundamental moral and social challenge was to make thebest of the possibilities which existed within that constraint rather thandissipate energies in an attempt to change human naturean attempt thatSmith treated as both vain and pointless For example if it were somehowpossible to make the European feel poignantly the full pain of those whosuffered in China this state of mind would be perfectly useless accordingto Smith except to make him miserable3 without being of any benefit tothe Chinese Smith said Nature it seems when she loaded us with ourown sorrows thought that they were enough and therefore did notcommand us to take any further share in those of others than what wasnecessary to prompt us to relieve them4 Instead of regarding mans nature as something that could or should bechanged Smith attempted to determine how the moral and social benefitsdesired could be produced in the most efficient way within that constraintSmith approached the production and distribution of moral behavior inmuch the same way he would later approach the production and distributionof material goods Although he was a professor of moral philosophy histhought processes were already those of an economist However theconstrained vision is by no means limited to economists Smithscontemporary in politics Edmund Burke perhaps best summarized theconstrained vision from a political perspective when he spoke of a radicalinfirmity in all human contrivances5 an infirmity inherent in thefundamental nature of things Similar views were expressed by AlexanderHamilton in The Federalist PapersIt is the lot of all human institutions even those of the most perfectkind to have defects as well as excellenciesill as well as goodpropensities This results from the imperfection of the Institutor Man6   Returning to Adam Smiths example a society cannot functionhumanely if at all when each person acts as if his little finger is moreimportant than the lives of a hundred million other human beings But thecrucial word here is act We cannot prefer ourselves so shamelessly andblindly to others when we act Adam Smith said7 even if that is thespontaneous or natural inclination of our feelings In practice people onmany occasions sacrifice their own interests to the greater interests ofothers according to Smith8 but this was due to such intervening factors asdevotion to moral principles to concepts of honor and nobility rather thanto loving ones neighbor as oneself9 Through such artificial devices man could be persuaded to do for hisown selfimage or inner needs what he would not do for the good of hisfellow man In short such concepts were seen by Smith as the mostefficient way to get the moral job done at the lowest psychic cost Despitethe fact that this was a moral question Smiths answer was essentiallyeconomica system of moral incentives a set of tradeoffs rather than areal solution by changing man One of the hallmarks of the constrainedvision is that it deals in tradeoffs rather than solutions In his later classic work The Wealth of Nations Smith went furtherEconomic benefits to society were largely unintended by individuals butemerged systemically from the interactions of the marketplace under thepressures of competition and the incentives of individual gain10 Moralsentiments were necessary only for shaping the general framework of lawswithin which this systemic process could go on This was yet another way in which man with all the limitationsconceived by Smith could be induced to produce benefits for others forreasons ultimately reducible to selfinterest It was not an atomistic theorythat individual selfinterests added up to the interest of society On thecontrary the functioning of the economy and society required eachindividual to do things for other people it was simply the motivation behindthese actswhether moral or economicwhich was ultimately selfcentered In both his moral and his economic analyses Smith relied onincentives rather than dispositions to get the job done The Unconstrained Vision Perhaps no other eighteenthcentury book presents such a contrast to thevision of man in Adam Smith as William Godwins Enquiry ConcerningPolitical Justice a work as remarkable for its fate as for its contents Animmediate success upon its publication in England in 1793 within a decadeit encountered the chilling effect of British hostile reactions to ideaspopularly associated with the French Revolution especially after Francebecame an enemy in war By the time two decades of warfare between thetwo countries were ended at Waterloo Godwin and his work had beenrelegated to the periphery of intellectual life and he was subsequently bestknown for his influence on Shelley Yet no work from the eighteenthcentury age of reason so clearly so consistently and so systematicallyelaborated the unconstrained vision of man as did Godwins treatise Where in Adam Smith moral and socially beneficial behavior could beevoked from man only by incentives in William Godwin mansunderstanding and disposition were capable of intentionally creating socialbenefits Godwin regarded the intention to benefit others as being of theessence of virtue11 and virtue in turn as being the road to humanhappiness Unintentional social benefits were treated by Godwin as scarcelyworthy of notice12 His was the unconstrained vision of human nature inwhich man was capable of directly feeling other peoples needs as moreimportant than his own and therefore of consistently acting impartiallyeven when his own interests or those of his family were involved13 Thiswas not meant as an empirical generalization about the way most peoplecurrently behaved It was meant as a statement of the underlying nature ofhuman potential Conceding current egocentric behavior did not imply that it was apermanent feature of human nature as human nature was conceived in theunconstrained vision Godwin said Men are capable no doubt ofpreferring an inferior interest of their own to a superior interest of othersbut this preference arises from a combination of circumstances and is notthe necessary and invariable law of our nature14 Godwin referred to menas they hereafter may be made15 in contrast to Burkes view We cannotchange the Nature of things and of menbut must act upon them the bestwe can16 Socially contrived incentives were disdained by Godwin as unworthy andunnecessary expedients when it was possible to achieve directly whatSmiths incentives were designed to achieve indirectly If a thousand menare to be benefited I ought to recollect that I am only an atom in thecomparison and to reason accordingly17 Unlike Smith who regardedhuman selfishness as a given Godwin regarded it as being promoted by thevery system of rewards used to cope with it The real solution toward whichefforts should be bent was to have people do what is right because it isright not because of psychic or economic payments that is not becausesomeone has annexed to it a great weight of self interest18 Having an unconstrained vision of the yet untapped moral potential ofhuman beings Godwin was not preoccupied like Smith with what is themost immediately effective incentive under the current state of things Thereal goal was the longrun development of a higher sense of social duty Tothe extent that immediately effective incentives retarded that longrundevelopment their benefits were ephemeral or illusory The hope ofreward and fear of punishment were in Godwins vision wrong inthemselves and inimical to the improvement of the mind19 In thisGodwin was seconded by another contemporary exemplar of theunconstrained vision the Marquis de Condorcet who rejected the wholeidea of turning prejudices and vices to good account rather than trying todispel or repress them Such mistakes Condorcet traced to hisadversaries vision of human naturetheir confusing the natural man andhis potential with existing man corrupted by prejudices artificial passionsand social customs20 TRADEOFFS VERSUS SOLUTIONS Prudencethe careful weighing of tradeoffsis seen in very differentterms within the constrained and the unconstrained visions In theconstrained vision where tradeoffs are all that we can hope for prudenceis among the highest duties Edmund Burke called it the first of allvirtues21 Nothing is good Burke said but in proportion and withreference22in short as a tradeoff By contrast in the unconstrainedvision where moral improvement has no fixed limit prudence is of a lowerorder of importance Godwin had little use for those moralistsquiteconceivably meaning Smithwho think only of stimulating men to gooddeeds by considerations of frigid prudence and mercenary selfinterestsinstead of seeking to stimulate the generous and magnanimous sentimentof our natures23 Implicit in the unconstrained vision is the notion that the potential is verydifferent from the actual and that means exist to improve human naturetoward its potential or that such means can be evolved or discovered sothat man will do the right thing for the right reason rather than for ulteriorpsychic or economic rewards Condorcet expressed a similar vision whenhe declared that man can eventually fulfill by a natural inclination thesame duties which today cost him effort and sacrifice24 Thus a solutioncan supersede mere tradeoffs Man is in short perfectiblemeaning continually improvable ratherthan capable of actually reaching absolute perfection We can come nearerand nearer according to Godwin25 though one cannot prescribe limits tothis process26 It is sufficient for his purpose that men are eminentlycapable of justice and virtue27not only isolated individuals but thewhole species28 Efforts must be made to wake the sleeping virtues ofmankind29 Rewarding existing behavior patterns was seen as antitheticalto this goal Here too Condorcet reached similar conclusions The perfectibility ofman he said was truly indefinite30 The progress of the human mindwas a recurring theme in Condorcet31 He acknowledged that there werelimits of mans intelligence32 that no one believed it possible for man toknow all the facts of nature or to attain the ultimate means of precisionin their measurement or analysis33 But while there was ultimately a limit tomans mental capability according to Condorcet no one could specify whatit was He was indignant that Locke dared to set a limit to humanunderstanding34 As a devotee of mathematics Condorcet conceivedperfectibility as a neverending asymptotic approach to a mathematicallimit35 While use of the word perfectibility has faded away over the centuriesthe concept has survived largely intact to the present time The notion thatthe human being is highly plastic material36 is still central among manycontemporary thinkers who share the unconstrained vision The concept ofsolution remains central to this vision A solution is achieved when it isno longer necessary to make a tradeoff even if the development of thatsolution entailed costs now past The goal of achieving a solution is in factwhat justifies the initial sacrifices or transitional conditions which mightotherwise be considered unacceptable Condorcet for example anticipatedthe eventual reconciliation the identification of the interests of each withthe interests of allat which point the path of virtue is no longerarduous37 Man could act under the influence of a socially beneficialdisposition rather than simply in response to ulterior incentives SOCIAL MORALITY AND SOCIALCAUSATION Human actions were dichotomized by Godwin into the beneficial and theharmful and each of these in turn was dichotomized into the intentional andthe unintentional The intentional creation of benefits was called virtue38the intentional creation of harm was vice39 and the unintentional creationof harm was negligence a subspecies of vice40 These definitions can berepresented schematically   BENEFICIAL HARMFULINTENTIONAL Virtue ViceUNINTENTIONAL Negligence   The missing category was unintentional benefit It was precisely thismissing category in Godwin that was central to Adam Smiths whole visionparticularly as it unfolded in his classic work The Wealth of Nations Theeconomic benefits to society produced by the capitalist were according toSmith no part of his intention41 The capitalists intentions werecharacterized by Smith as mean rapacity42 and capitalists as a group werereferred to as people who seldom meet together even for merriment ordiversion but the conversation ends in a conspiracy against the public or insome contrivance to raise prices43 Yet despite his repeatedly negativedepictions of capitalists44 unrivaled among economists until Karl MarxAdam Smith nevertheless became the patron saint of laissezfairecapitalism Intentions which were crucial in the unconstrained vision ofGodwin were irrelevant in the constrained vision of Smith What matteredto Smith were the systemic characteristics of a competitive economy whichhe saw as producing social benefits from unsavory individual intentions While Adam Smith and William Godwin have been cited as especiallyclear and straightforward writers espousing opposing visions each is part ofa vast tradition that continues powerful and contending for dominationtoday Even among their contemporaries Smith and Godwin each had manyintellectual compatriots with similar visions differently expressed anddiffering in details and degree Edmund Burkes Reflections on theRevolution in France in 1790 was perhaps the most ringing polemicalapplication of the constrained vision Thomas Paines equally polemicalreply The Rights of Man 1791 anticipated in many ways the moresystematic unfolding of the unconstrained vision by Godwin two years later Godwin credited Rousseau with being the first to teach that theimperfections of government were the only perennial source of the vices ofmankind45 Rousseau was certainly the most famous of those who arguedon the basis of a human nature not inherently constrained to its existinglimitations but narrowed and corrupted by social institutionsa vision alsofound in Condorcet and in Baron DHolbach among others of that era Inthe nineteenth century John Stuart Mill said that the present wretchededucation and wretched social arrangements were the only realhindrance to attaining general happiness among human beings46 Millsmost ringing rhetoric reflected the unconstrained vision though hiseclecticism in many areas caused him to include devastating provisos moreconsonant with the constrained vision47 Much of nineteenthcentury and twentiethcentury liberalism in theAmerican sense builds upon these foundations modified and varying indegree and applied to areas as disparate as education war and criminaljustice Marxism as we shall see was a special hybrid applying aconstrained vision to much of the past and an unconstrained vision to muchof the future When Harold Laski said that dissatisfaction was an expression ofserious ill in the body politic48 he was expressing the essence of theunconstrained vision in which neither man nor nature have such inherentconstraints as to disappoint our hopes so that existing institutionstraditions or rulers must be responsible for dissatisfaction Converselywhen Malthus attributed human misery to laws inherent in the nature ofman and absolutely independent of all human regulations49 he wasexpressing one of the most extreme forms of the constrained visionencompassing inherent constraints in both nature and man Godwins reply to Malthus not surprisingly applied the unconstrainedvision to both nature and man Men are born into the world in everycountry where the cultivation of the earth is practised with the naturalfaculty in each man of producing more food than he can consume a facultywhich cannot be controlled but by the injurious exclusions of humaninstitution50 Given the unconstrained possibilities of man and naturepoverty or other sources of dissatisfaction could only be a result of evilintentions or blindness to solutions readily achievable by changing existinginstitutions By contrast Burke considered complaints about our times and rulers tobe part of the general infirmities of human nature and that true politicalsagacity was required to separate these perennial complaints from realindicators of a special malaise51 Hobbes went even further arguing that itwas precisely when men are at ease that they are most troublesomepolitically52 The constraints of nature are themselves important largely through theconstraints of human nature The inherent natural constraint of the need forfood for example becomes a practical social problem only insofar ashuman beings multiply to the point where subsistence becomes difficult toachieve for a growing population Thus this central constraint of nature inMalthus becomes socially important only because of Malthus highlyconstrained vision of human nature which he saw as inevitably behaving insuch a way as to populate the earth to that point But Godwin who readilyconceded the natural constraint had a very different vision of humannature which would not needlessly overpopulate Therefore the possibilityof a geometrical increase in people was of no concern to Godwin becausepossible men do not eat though real men do53 Malthus on the other hand saw overpopulation not as an abstractpossibility in the future but as a concrete reality already manifestedAccording to Malthus the period when the number of men surpass theirmeans of subsistence has long since arrived    has existed ever since wehave had any histories of mankind does exist at present and will for evercontinue to exist54 It would be hard to conceive of a more absolutestatement of a constrained vision Where Malthus and Godwin differed wasnot over a natural factthe need for foodbut over behavioral theoriesbased on very different visions of human nature Most followers of theunconstrained vision likewise acknowledge death for example as aninherent constraint of nature though Godwin and Condorcet did not ruleout an eventual conquest of death but simply do not treat this as aconstraint on the social development of mankind which lives on despite thedeaths of individuals The great evils of the worldwar poverty and crime for exampleareseen in completely different terms by those with the constrained and theunconstrained visions If human options are not inherently constrained thenthe presence of such repugnant and disastrous phenomena virtually cries outfor explanationand for solutions But if the limitations and passions ofman himself are at the heart of these painful phenomena then what requiresexplanation are the ways in which they have been avoided or minimizedWhile believers in the unconstrained vision seek the special causes of warpoverty and crime believers in the constrained vision seek the specialcauses of peace wealth or a lawabiding society In the unconstrainedvision there are no intractable reasons for social evils and therefore noreason why they cannot be solved with sufficient moral commitment Butin the constrained vision whatever artifices or strategies restrain orameliorate inherent human evils will themselves have costs some in theform of other social ills created by these civilizing institutions so that allthat is possible is a prudent tradeoff The two great revolutions in the eighteenth centuryin France and inAmericacan be viewed as applications of these differing visions thoughwith all the reservations necessary whenever the flesh and blood of complexhistorical events are compared to skeletal theoretical models Theunderlying premises of the French Revolution more clearly reflected theunconstrained vision of man which prevailed among its leaders Theintellectual foundations of the American Revolution were more mixedincluding men like Thomas Paine and Thomas Jefferson whose thinkingwas similar in many ways to that in France but also including as adominant influence on the Constitution the classic constrained vision ofman expressed in The Federalist Papers Where Robespierre lookedforward to the end of revolutionary bloodshed when all people will havebecome equally devoted to their country and its laws55 AlexanderHamilton in The Federalist Papers regarded the idea of individual actionsunbiased by considerations not connected with the public good as aprospect more ardently to be wished than seriously to be expected56Robespierre sought a solution Hamilton a tradeoff The Constitution of the United States with its elaborate checks andbalances clearly reflected the view that no one was ever to be completelytrusted with power This was in sharp contrast to the French Revolutionwhich gave sweeping powers including the power of life and death tothose who spoke in the name of the people expressing the Rousseaueangeneral will Even when bitterly disappointed with particular leaders whowere then deposed and executed believers in this vision did notsubstantially change their political systems or beliefs viewing the evil aslocalized in individuals who had betrayed the revolution The writers of The Federalist Papers were quite conscious of the visionof man that underlay the Constitution of checks and balances which theyespousedIt may be a reflection on human nature that such devices should benecessary to control the abuses of government But what isgovernment itself but the greatest of all reflections on human nature57   To the Federalists the evil was inherent in man and institutions weresimply ways of trying to cope with it Adam Smith likewise sawgovernment as an imperfect remedy for the deficiency of wisdom andvirtue in man58 The Federalist Papers saidWhy has government been instituted at all Because the passions ofmen will not conform to the dictates of reason and justice withoutconstraint59   To those without this constrained vision of man the whole elaboratesystem of constitutional checks and balances was a needless complicationand impediment Condorcet condemned such counterweights for creatingan overcomplicated political machine to weigh upon the people60 Hesaw no need for society to be jostled between opposing powers61 or heldback by the inertia of constitutional checks and balances62 The constrained vision is a tragic vision of the human condition Theunconstrained vision is a moral vision of human intentions which areviewed as ultimately decisive The unconstrained vision promotes pursuit ofthe highest ideals and the best solutions By contrast the constrained visionsees the best as the enemy of the gooda vain attempt to reach theunattainable being seen as not only futile but often counterproductive whilethe same efforts could have produced a more viable and beneficial tradeoffAdam Smith applied this reasoning not only to economics but also tomorality and politics The prudent reformer according to Smith willrespect the confirmed habits and prejudices of the people and when hecannot establish what is right he will not disdain to ameliorate the wrongHis goal is not to create the ideal but to establish the best that the peoplecan bear63 But Condorcet expressing the unconstrained vision rejected any notionthat laws should change with the temperature and adapt to the forms ofgovernment to the practices that superstition has consecrated and even tothe stupidities adopted by each people   64 Thus he found the FrenchRevolution superior to the American Revolution for the principles fromwhich the constitution and laws of France were derived were purer andallowed the people to exercise their sovereign right without constraint65Related to this is the question whether the institutions of one society can betransferred to another or particular blueprints for better societies be appliedto very different countries Jeremy Bentham was noted for producing bothspecific reforms and general principles intended to apply in very differentsocieties Yet to Hamilton What may be good at Philadelphia may be badat Paris and ridiculous at Petersburgh66 Each of these conclusions isconsistent with the respective vision from which it came While the constrained vision sees human nature as essentially unchangedacross the ages and around the world the particular cultural expressions ofhuman needs peculiar to specific societies are not seen as being readily andbeneficially changeable by forcible intervention By contrast those with theunconstrained vision tend to view human nature as beneficially changeableand social customs as expendable holdovers from the past Ideals are weighed against the cost of achieving them in the constrainedvision But in the unconstrained vision every closer approximation to theideal should be preferred Costs are regrettable but by no means decisiveThomas Jeffersons reply to those who turned against the FrenchRevolution because of the innocent people it had killed exemplified thispointMy own affections have been deeply wounded by some of the martyrsto this cause but rather than it should have failed I would have seenhalf the earth desolated67   Belief in the irrelevance of process costs in the pursuit of social justicecould hardly have been expressed more clearly or categorically Yet in theend Jefferson too turned against the French Revolution as its human costincreased beyond what he could continue to accept Jefferson was notcompletely or irrevocably committed to the unconstrained vision The relative importance of process costs has continued over thecenturies to distinguish the constrained and the unconstrained visionsModern defenders of legal technicalities which allow criminals to escapepunishment who declare That is the price we pay for freedom ordefenders of revolutions who say You cant make omelettes withoutbreaking eggs are contemporary exemplars of an unconstrained visionwhich has historically treated process costs as secondary At the other endof the philosophical spectrum are those who in essence repeat AdamSmiths view of process costs The peace and order of society is of moreimportance than even the relief of the miserable68 The continuing battlebetween ideals and the costs of achieving them is only one part of theongoing conflict of visions SUMMARY AND IMPLICATIONS Visions rest ultimately on some sense of the nature of mannot simply hisexisting practices but his ultimate potential and ultimate limitations Thosewho see the potentialities of human nature as extending far beyond what iscurrently manifested have a social vision quite different from those who seehuman beings as tragically limited creatures whose selfish and dangerousimpulses can be contained only by social contrivances which themselvesproduce unhappy side effects William Godwin and Adam Smith are two ofthe clearest and most consistent exemplars of these respective social visionsthe unconstrained and the constrained Yet they are neither the first northe last in these two long traditions of social thought When Rousseau said that man is born free but is everywhere inchains69 he expressed the essence of the unconstrained vision in whichthe fundamental problem is not nature or man but institutions According toRousseau men are not naturally enemies70 The diametrically oppositevision was presented in Hobbes Leviathan where the armed power ofpolitical institutions was all that prevented the war of each against all71 thatwould otherwise exist among men in their natural state where life would besolitary poore nasty brutish and short72 While the unconstrained visionof Condorcet led him to seek a society in which mans natural inclinationwould coincide with the social good73 Hayeks constrained vision led to theconclusion that the indispensable rules of the free society require from usmuch that is unpleasant74that is mans nature inherently could notcoincide with the social good but must be deliberately subordinated to itdespite the unpleasantness which this entailed Given the wider capabilities of man in the unconstrained vision theintentions which guide those capabilities are especially important Wordsand concepts which revolve around intentionsincerity commitmentdedicationhave been central to discussions within the framework of theunconstrained vision for centuries and the policies sought by this visionhave often been described in terms of their intended goals Libertyequality fraternity ending the exploitation of man by man or socialjustice for example But in the constrained vision where mans ability todirectly consummate his intentions is very limited intentions mean far lessBurke referred to the Beneficial effects of human faults and to the illconsequences attending the most undoubted Virtues75 Adam Smithsentire economic doctrine of laissezfaire implicitly assumed the same lackof correspondence between intention and effect for the systemic benefits ofcapitalism were no part of the intention of capitalists In the constrained vision social processes are described not in terms ofintentions or ultimate goals but in terms of the systemic characteristicsdeemed necessary to contribute to those goalsproperty rights freeenterprise or strict construction of the Constitution for example It isnot merely that there are different goals in the two visions but morefundamentally that the goals relate to different things The unconstrainedvision speaks directly in terms of desired results the constrained vision interms of process characteristics considered conducive to desired results butnot directly or without many unhappy side effects which are accepted aspart of a tradeoff With all the complex differences among social thinkers as of a giventime and still more so over time it is nevertheless possible to recognizecertain key assumptions about human nature and about social causationwhich permit some to be grouped together as belonging to the constrainedvision and others as belonging to the unconstrained vision Although thesegroupings do not encompass all social theorists they cover many importantfigures and enduring ideological conflicts of the past two centuries Running through the tradition of the unconstrained vision is theconviction that foolish or immoral choices explain the evils of the worldand that wiser or more moral and humane social policies are the solutionWilliam Godwins elaboration of this unconstrained vision in his EnquiryConcerning Political Justice drew upon and systematized such ideas foundamong numerous eighteenthcentury thinkersJeanJacques RousseauVoltaire Condorcet Thomas Paine and Holbach being notable examplesThis general approach was carried forth in the nineteenth century in theirvery different ways by SaintSimon Robert Owen and by George BernardShaw and other Fabians Its twentiethcentury echoes are found in politicaltheorists such as Harold Laski in economists like Thorstein Veblen andJohn Kenneth Galbraith and in the law with a whole school of advocates ofjudicial activism epitomized by Ronald Dworkin in theory and Earl Warrenin practice By contrast the constrained vision sees the evils of the world as derivingfrom the limited and unhappy choices available given the inherent moraland intellectual limitations of human beings For amelioration of these evilsand the promotion of progress they rely on the systemic characteristics ofcertain social processes such as moral traditions the marketplace orfamilies They conceive of these processes as evolved rather than designedand rely on these general patterns of social interaction rather than onspecific policy designed to directly produce particular results for particularindividuals or groups This constrained view of human capacities found inAdam Smith is also found in a long series of other social thinkers rangingfrom Thomas Hobbes in the seventeenth century through Edmund Burkeand the authors of The Federalist Papers among Smiths contemporariesthrough such twentiethcentury figures as Oliver Wendell Holmes in lawMilton Friedman in economics and Friedrich A Hayek in general socialtheory Not all social thinkers fit this schematic dichotomy John Stuart Mill andKarl Marx for example do not fit for very different reasons as will benoted in Chapter 5 Others take midway positions between the two visionsor convert from one to the other However the conflict of visions is no lessreal because everyone has not chosen sides or irrevocably committedthemselves Despite necessary caveats it remains an important and remarkablephenomenon that how human nature is conceived at the outset is highlycorrelated with the whole conception of knowledge morality power timerationality war freedom and law which defines a social vision Thesecorrelations will be explored in the chapters that follow Because various beliefs theories and systems of social thought arespread across a continuum perhaps even a multidimensional continuumit might in one sense be more appropriate to refer to less constrained visionsand more constrained visions instead of the dichotomy used here Howeverthe dichotomy is not only more convenient but also captures an importantdistinction Virtually no one believes that man is 100 percent unconstrainedand virtually no one believes that man is 100 percent constrained Whatputs a given thinker in the tradition of one vision rather than the other is notsimply whether he refers more to mans constraints or to his untappedpotential but whether or to what extent constraints are built into the verystructure and operation of a particular theory Those whose theoriesincorporate these constraints as a central feature have a constrained visionthose whose theories do not make these constraints an integral or centralpart of the analysis have an unconstrained vision Every vision bydefinition leaves something outindeed leaves most things out Thedichotomy between constrained and unconstrained visions is based onwhether or not inherent limitations of man are among the key elementsincluded in the vision The dichotomy is justified in yet another sense These different ways ofconceiving man and the world lead not merely to different conclusions butto sharply divergent often diametrically opposed conclusions on issuesranging from justice to war There are not merely differences of visions butconflicts of visions Chapter 3 Visions of Knowledge and Reason The constrained and the unconstrained visions tend to differ in their verydefinition of knowledge as well as in their conceptions of its quantityconcentration or dispersal and its role in the social process Reasonlikewise takes on entirely different meanings in the two visions THE MOBILIZATION OF KNOWLEDGE The Constrained Vision In the constrained vision any individuals own knowledge alone is grosslyinadequate for social decisionmaking and often even for his own personaldecisions A complex society and its progress are therefore possible onlybecause of numerous social arrangements which transmit and coordinateknowledge from a tremendous range of contemporaries as well as from theeven more vast numbers of those from generations past Knowledge asconceived in the constrained vision is predominantly experiencetransmitted socially in largely inarticulate forms from prices which indicatecosts scarcities and preferences to traditions which evolve from the daytoday experiences of millions in each generation winnowing out inDarwinian competition what works from what does not work Friedrich AHayek expressed this view when he saidThe growth of knowledge and the growth of civilization are the sameonly if we interpret knowledge to include all the human adaptations toenvironment in which past experience has been incorporated Not allknowledge in this sense is part of our intellect nor is our intellect thewhole of our knowledge Our habits and skills our emotional attitudesour tools and our institutionsall are in this sense adaptations to pastexperience which have grown up by selective elimination of lesssuitable conduct They are as much an indispensable foundation ofsuccessful action as is our conscious knowledge1   In this vision it is not simply that individuals rationally choose whatworks from what does not work but alsoand more fundamentallythatthe competition of institutions and whole societies leads to a generalsurvival of more effective collections of cultural traits even if neither thewinners nor the losers rationally understand what was better or worse aboutone set or the other Values which may be effective at the tribal level willtend to be overwhelmed by values that permit or promote the functioning oflarger aggregations of people From this perspective man has certainlymore often learnt to do the right thing without comprehending why it wasthe right thing and he still is better served by custom than understandingThere is thus more intelligence incorporated in the system of rules ofconduct than in mans thoughts about his surroundings2 Knowledge is thus the social experience of the many as embodied inbehavior sentiments and habits rather than the specially articulated reasonof the few however talented or gifted those few might be When knowledgeis conceived as social experience rather than solitary excogitation then avery small part is gained in the closet according to Hamilton3 In Burkes words We are afraid to put men to live and trade each on hisown private stock of reason because we suspect that this stock in each manis small and that the individuals would do better to avail themselves of thegeneral bank and capital of nations and of ages4 By reason Burke did notmean simply the written words of notable individuals but the wholeexperience of peoples summarized in the feelings formalities and evenprejudices embodied in their culture and behavior These culturaldistillations of knowledge were not considered infallible or immutablewhich would have been a solution instead of a tradeoffbut rather as atested body of experience that worked and which was to be changed onlyafter the most circumspect and perhaps even reluctant examination Weshould attend to the defects of the social order according to Burke with thesame trepidation with which we would tend the wounds of our father5 Theyare not to be ignored but neither are they a mandate for experiment or hastyinspiration With no examination whatever there would be no evolutionaryprocess and therefore in this vision no basis for the confidence in traditionand enduring institutions which was the hallmark of Burke and to varyingdegrees of other believers in a constrained vision The tradeoff perspective of the constrained vision treats defects asinevitable and therefore not in themselves reason for change unless theirmagnitudes merit the inevitable costs entailed by change Preserving myprinciples unshaken Burke said I reserve my activity for rationalendeavours6 On another occasion he said I must bear with infirmitiesuntil they fester into crimes7 This was not a mere verbal patina onapathetic drift as shown by Burkes own relentless prosecution of WarrenHastings for alleged misconduct in his governance of India or Burkesunpopular stand in Parliament for freeing the rebellious American coloniesor his antislavery proposals8 Adam Smith likewise urged the freeing of theAmerican coloniesand other colonies as wellin addition to suggesting anumber of domestic reforms and being opposed to slavery9 In America themen who wrote The Federalist PapersAlexander Hamilton JamesMadison and John Jayfirst came to public notice as leaders in the revoltagainst British rule The constrained vision was not synonymous with orcamouflage for acceptance of the status quo The Unconstrained Vision The unconstrained vision had no such limited view of human knowledge orof its application through reason It was the eighteenthcentury exemplars ofthe unconstrained vision who created the age of reason as expressed inthe title of Thomas Paines famous book of that era Reason was asparamount in their vision as experience was in the constrained visionAccording to Godwin experience was greatly overratedunreasonablymagnified in his wordscompared to reason or to the general power of acultivated mind10 Therefore the wisdom of the ages was seen by Godwinas largely the illusions of the ignorant The age of a belief or practice didnot exempt it from the crucial test of validation in specifically articulatedterms In Godwins words we must bring everything to the standard ofreason He addedNothing must be sustained because it is ancient because we have beenaccustomed to regard it as sacred or because it has been unusual tobring its validity into question11   Similarly according to Condorcet everything that bears the imprint oftime must inspire distrust more than respect12 It was only bymeditation Condorcet said that we can arrive at any general truths in thescience of man13 Given the ability of a cultivated mind to apply reason directly to thefacts at hand there was no necessity to defer to the unarticulated systemicprocesses of the constrained vision as expressed in the collective wisdomderived from the past The pretense of collective wisdom is the mostpalpable of all impostures according to Godwin14 Validation was not tobe indirect collective and systemic but direct individual and intentionalArticulated rationality was to be the mode of validation not generalacceptance based on pragmatic experience According to Godwin personsof narrow views and observation readily accept whatever happens toprevail in their society15 Therefore this cannot be the method by which todecide issues Implicit in the unconstrained vision is a profound inequality between theconclusions of persons of narrow views and those with cultivatedminds From this it follows that progress involves raising the level of theformer to that of the latter According to GodwinReal intellectual improvement demands that mind should as speedilyas possible be advanced to the height of knowledge already existingamong the enlightened members of the community and start fromthence in pursuit of further acquisitions16   Also implicit in the unconstrained vision is the view that the relevantcomparison is between the beliefs of one sort of person and anotherbetween x and y rather than between 1 systemic processes workingthrough successive generations of individuals a through x as expressedthrough the living generation x versus 2 the articulated rationality of y inisolation The rejection of the concept of collective wisdom leavesindividual comparisons as the standard of judgment Since the experiencesof a through w no longer count the issue reduces to the articulatedrationality of x versus that of y Therefore the unconstrained visionnecessarily favors the cultivated mind y while the constrained visionnecessarily favors the views expressed through x seen as representative ofthe unarticulated experience of many others a through w The two visionsthus lead to opposite conclusions as to which opinion should prevail andwhy Burke clearly saw himself in the role of x rather than yI give you opinions which have been accepted amongst us from veryearly times to this moment with a continued and general approbationand which indeed are so worked into my mind that I am unable todistinguish what I have learned from others from the results of my ownmeditations17   The kind of knowledge or understanding referred to by Burke wasconceived as a common fund in which he participated That of Godwin wasthe knowledge or understanding of cultivated mindsa knowledgewhich by its nature was concentrated in a few rather than dispersed amongthe many The very meaning of knowledge was also different which is whyit was distributed so differently in the two visions In the constrained visionwhere knowledge was a multiplicity of experience too complex for explicitarticulation it was distilled over the generations in cultural processes andtraits so deeply embedded as to be virtually unconscious reflexeswidelyshared This was in Burkes words wisdom without reflection18 Wisdom without reflection was a concept utterly foreign to theunconstrained vision in which human beings have both the capacity and theobligation to exercise explicit reason on all issues Reason according toGodwin is the proper instrument and the sufficient instrument forregulating the actions of mankind19 Passions and biases may exist but ifwe employ our rational faculties we cannot fail of thus conquering ourerroneous propensities20 Given that explicitly articulated knowledge is special and concentratedin the unconstrained vision the best conduct of social activities dependsupon the special knowledge of the few being used to guide the actions ofthe many What is needed is to infuse just views of society into theliberally educated and reflecting members of society who in turn will beto the people guides and instructors according to Godwin21 This ideawas by no means peculiar to Godwin but rather has been a central andenduring theme of the unconstrained vision Along with it has often gone avision of intellectuals as disinterested advisors Voltaire declared thephilosophers having no particular interest to defend can only speak up infavor of reason and the public interest22 Condorcet likewise referred totruly enlightened philosophers strangers to ambition23 Rousseauconsidered it the best and most natural arrangement for the wisest togovern the multitude24 Even if nonintellectuals run the actual machineryof government according to DAlembert the greatest happiness of anation is realized when those who govern agree with those who instructit25 These eighteenthcentury themes were repeated with at least equal vigorby John Stuart Mill in the nineteenth century To Mill a special role wasreserved for the most cultivated intellects in the country26 for thinkingminds27 for the best and the wisest28 for the really superior intellectsand characters29 Much could be accomplished if the superior spiritswould but join with each other30 if the universities would send forth asuccession of minds not the creatures of their age but capable of being itsimprovers and regenerators31 Similar prescriptions remain common todayIn short the special role of thinking people or of the brightest and thebest has for centuries been a central theme of the unconstrained vision For those with the constrained vision however a special role forintellectuals in the running of society has long been seen as a grave dangerIn Burkes wordsHappy if learning not debauched by ambition had been satisfied tocontinue the instructor and not aspired to be the master32   John Randolph was likewise repelled by the idea of professors in auniversity turned statesmen33 In a similar vein Hobbes regardeduniversities as places where fashionable but insignificant words flourished34and added that there is nothing so absurd but may be found in the booksof Philosophers35 The central danger as seen by those with the constrained vision is theintellectuals narrow conception of what constitutes knowledge andwisdom They are in Burkes words endeavouring to confine thereputation of sense learning and taste to themselves or their followingand are capable of carrying the intolerance of the tongue and of the peninto a persecution of others36 Adam Smith spoke of the doctrinaire manof system who is wise in his own conceit and who seems to imaginethat he can arrange the different members of a great society with as muchease as the hand arranges the different pieces upon a chessboard37 Thewhole notion of a philosopherking was abhorrent to Smith who declaredthat of all political speculators sovereign princes are by far the mostdangerous38 The superiority of experts within a narrow slice of the vast spectrum ofhuman understanding was not denied What was denied was that thisexpertise conferred a general superiority which should supersede morewidely dispersed kinds of knowledge It may be admitted that as far asscientific knowledge is concerned a body of suitably chosen experts maybe in the best position to command all the best knowledge availableaccording to Hayek But he added with respect to other kinds ofknowledge practically every individual has some advantage over allothers because he possesses unique information of which beneficial usemight be made but of which use can be made only if the decisionsdepending on it are left to him or are made with his active cooperation39With knowledge conceived of as both fragmented and widely dispersedsystemic coordination among the many supersedes the special wisdom ofthe few Nor was this systemic coordination to be planned or imposed by the wisefew It was an evolved natural order in the phrase of one of the eighteenthcentury Physiocrats40 the group who coined the expression laissezfaireThe same kind of reasoning was found in Adam Smith the most famousexponent of this doctrineThe statesman who should attempt to direct people in what mannerthey ought to employ their capitals would not only load himself with amost unnecessary attention but assume an authority which couldsafely be trusted not only to no single person but to no council orsenate whatever and which would nowhere be so dangerous as in thehands of a man who had folly and presumption enough to fancyhimself fit to exercise it41   The marketplace was only one of a number of evolved systemicprocesses for making decisions The family languages and traditions areother examples among many Believers in the constrained vision relyheavily on such processes to make better decisions than any givenindividual could make however talented or knowledgeable compared toother individuals In short starting from different conceptions of how much a givenindividual can know and understand the constrained and the unconstrainedvisions arrive at opposite conclusions as to whether the best social decisionsare to be made by those with the most individual knowledge of a specialkind or by systemic processes that mobilize and coordinate knowledgescattered among the many in individually unimpressive amounts ARTICULATED VERSUS SYSTEMICRATIONALITY The power of specifically articulated rationality is central to theunconstrained vision The power of unarticulated social processes tomobilize and coordinate knowledge is central to the constrained vision In the unconstrained vision to act without explicit reason is to act onprepossession and prejudice42 According to Godwin Discussion is thepath that leads to discovery and demonstration43 Accuracy of language isthe indispensable prerequisite of sound knowledge44 in Godwins visionwhere knowledge is synonymous with articulated rationality Virtue ispromoted when men must avow their actions and assign the reasons uponwhich they are founded45 If we could render the plain dictates of justicelevel to every capacity according to Godwin we may expect the wholespecies to become reasonable and virtuous46 To Condorcet as well thetask is to render common to almost every man those principles of strict andunsullied justice47 Reason has at least two very different meanings One is a causeandeffect meaning There is a reason why water expands when it freezes intoice even though most of us who are not physicists do not know what thatreason isand at one time no one knew the reason The other meaning ofreason is articulated specification of causation or logic When it isdemanded that individuals or society justify their actions before the bar ofreason this is what is meant The more constrained ones vision of humancapabilities and potential the greater the difference between these twomeanings Everything may have a cause and yet human beings may beunable to specify what it is Since no theory is literally unconstrainedentirely there is always some awareness of the difference between the twomeanings of reason Conversely no theory is so constrained that man can understand nothingwhich would imply a total lack of overlap between the two meanings ofreason But at the more unconstrained end of the spectrum the overlapbetween the two concepts is considered to be so great that to say that areason exists is virtually to say that we can specify it At the very least ourdecisionmaking must proceed on the basis of those reasons which we canspecify But at the more constrained end of the spectrum knowledge andreasons unknown to any given individual must be brought to bear on manydecisions through social processes in which articulated rationality plays atbest a subordinate role Classical and neoclassical economics especially of the Austrian schoolexemplify this constrained vision of systemic rationality in whichindividual articulation means little In an uncontrolled market as seen inthis vision changing prices wages and interest rates adjust the economy toshifting demands technological changes and evolving skillswithout anyof the actors in this drama knowing or caring how his individual responsesaffect the whole It can be analyzed as a general process of interaction withits own characteristic patterns and resultsotherwise there would be noAustrian economicsbut cannot be specified in such concrete detail as tomake it feasible for any individual or group to plan or control the actualprocess The rationality in it is systemic not individualand suchindividual rationality as may exist is largely incidental so that the muchvexed question as to just how rational man is has little relevance in thisvision48 A similar difference between individual and systemic rationality can befound in religious doctrines in which 1 the Deity is conceived to actdirectly to affect natural and human phenomena versus 2 those in which aProvidential systemic process makes life possible and beneficent withoutrequiring Divine superintendence of details49 What both the secular and thereligious versions of systemic processes have in common is that the wisdomof the individual human actor is not the wisdom of the drama Converselythere are both secular and religious versions of individual rationality thereligious version being one in which the Deity directly decides onindividual events from daily weather changes to deaths of individualsFundamentalist religion is the most pervasive vision of central planningthough many fundamentalists may oppose human central planning as ausurpation or playing God This is consistent with the fundamentalistvision of an unconstrained God and a highly constrained man Law The two visions conflict in law as well as in economics and religion OliverWendell Holmes expressed the systemic concept when he declared Thelife of the law has not been logic it has been experience50 Articulationwas not essential to decisionmaking for many honorable and sensiblejudgments express an intuition of experience which outruns analysis andsums up many unnamed and tangled impressions impressions which maylie beneath consciousness without losing their worth51 Law incorporatesthe experience that reflects not only our own lives but the lives of all menthat have been according to Holmes52 It is a fallacy to conceive of lawas purely a process of articulated logic for while it is true in the broadestsense that the law is a logical development it is not worked out likemathematics from general axioms of conduct53 In short the logic of thelaws development is a systemic logicThe development of our law has gone on for nearly a thousand yearslike the development of a planet each generation taking the next stepmind like matter simply obeying a law of spontaneous growth54   John Stuart Mill however objected that laws are made not evolvedWhat those with the constrained vision characterized as a spontaneous orderevolving from history was merely the fortuitous concourse of atoms inages of barbarism according to Mill55 He saidThe laws of Moses those of Mahomet were made and did not growthey had it is true the direct sanction of religious faith but the laws ofLycurgus the laws of Solon were made and were as durable as anylaws which grew have hitherto been found56   To look at legal precedents was in Mills view to make an absurdsacrifice of present ends to antiquated means57 Yet as in other areas Mills assertions were modified if not repealed byhis provisos Those who make law have according to Mill taken intoaccount what the people will bear and that is a function of their ancienthabits or of their durable and strenuous convictions without which thewhole system of laws would become inoperative The acquiescence ofmankind thus depends upon the preservation of something like continuityof existence in institutions representing those innumerable compromisesbetween adverse interests and expectations without which no governmentcould be carried on a year and with difficulty even for a week58 Withthese provisos included Mills position is not very far from that to which itseems at first to be the very opposite namely that all the famous early lawgivers as Hayek put it did not intend to create new law but merely tostate what law was and had always been59 That is it was largely thearticulation of previously existing practice according to Hayek60 Many modern writers on law represent the unconstrained vision muchmore unambiguously than Mill For example Ronald Dworkin dismissesthe silly faith that ethics as well as economics moves by an invisible handso that individual rights and the general good will coalesce and law basedon principle will move the nation to a frictionless utopia where everyone isbetter off than he was before61 These different visions applied to the law lead to opposite conclusionsregarding judicial activism The unconstrained vision as applied byDworkin calls for an activist court to read its own meanings into thewords of the Constitution62 In this he is by no means alone either in hisconclusions or in the methods used to reach them His call for a fusion ofconstitutional law and moral theory63 for fresh moral insight64 has beenone among many65 Oliver Wendell Holmes conception of the law left no such room forjudicial activismIt is dangerous to tie down legislatures too closely by judicialconstructions not necessarily arising from the words of theConstitution66   Nor was it merely the words but rather the original meanings of thosewords that were to be adhered to He refused to declare unconstitutionalunder the Fourteenth Amendment methods of taxation which were wellknown when that Amendment was adopted67 He later spoke of the morethan anxiety that I feel at the everincreasing scope given to the FourteenthAmendment68 In yet another case he saw no reason for reading into theSherman Act more than we find there69 As in other clashes between the two visions the issue is posed verydifferently by each side Those with the unconstrained vision favoringarticulated rationality see the issue as one between two sets ofcontemporaries x and y while those with a constrained vision favoringsystemic processes see the issue as being between the experience ofsuccessive generations represented by group x in todays generation versusthe articulated rationality of their contemporary opponents group y Insofar as those with the unconstrained vision acknowledge priorgenerations they see the issue as being between some given priorgenerationsay generation hand the current generations group y This isdismissed as a conflict between the living and the dead in which the deadhave no right to rule beyond the grave70 From this perspective we mustuse our own reasoned and revocable will not some idealized ancestralcompulsion71 to advance Alternatively the conditions of prior times aredeemed irrelevant or less relevant than current views based on currentconditions Chief Justice Earl Warren for example spoke of contemporarycircumstances far beyond the wisdom of even the wisest of the FoundingFathers72 But when Oliver Wendell Holmes characterized the law as summarizingnot only our own lives but the lives of all men that have been he clearlyrejected any notion that the clash was between opposing groups in onegeneration or even between one contemporary group and one past groupsuch as the Founding Fathers Rather the clash was conceived as beingbetween two whole processes one of historical experience over manygenerations versus the articulated rationality of one contemporary school ofthought Neither Holmes nor others who argued for systemic processesseriously contest the claims of intellectual andor moral superiority whichare central to the articulated rationality and social justice of those with theunconstrained vision With the constrained vision the issue is not whetherone individual or group is wiser than another but whether systemicexperience is wiser than both Yet those who argue for deliberate lawmaking through judicial activismdo so not on the basis of having a democratic majority even in the givengeneration but rather of having an intellectually and morally superiorprocess for decisionmaking When Dworkin dismissed the opposingprocess as a silly faith a pessimistic theory of human nature73 thecurious philosophy of Edmund Burke74 and the chaotic and unprincipleddevelopment of history75 this was a prelude to asserting a superioritycompetent to override a democratic majority of contemporaries quite asidefrom dismissing prior generations For Dworkin a more equal society is abetter society even if its citizens prefer inequality76 Social Policy The two visions entail very different views of the relationship betweenmembers of the existing society The unconstrained vision has tendedhistorically toward creating more equalized economic and social conditionsin society even if the means chosen imply great inequality in the right todecide such issues and choose such means Clearly only very unequalintellectual and moral standing could justify having equality imposedwhether the people want it or not as Dworkin suggests and only veryunequal power would make it possible It is consistent for the unconstrainedvision to promote equalitarian ends by unequalitarian means given thegreat differences between those whom Mill called the wisest and best andthose who have not yet reached that intellectual and moral level Conversely those with the constrained vision have tended to be lessconcerned with promoting economic and social equality but moreconcerned with the dangers of an inequality of power producing anarticulate ruling elite of rationalists In Hayeks wordsThe most dangerous state in the growth of civilization may well be thatin which man has come to regard all these beliefs as superstitions andrefuses to accept or to submit to anything which he does not rationallyunderstand The rationalist whose reason is not sufficient to teach himthose limitations of the power of conscious reason and who despisesall the institutions and customs which have not been consciouslydesigned would thus become the destroyer of the civilization builtupon them77   The clash over judicial activism reflects a much more general clash overthe best way to contribute to the social good In the unconstrained visionwise and conscientious individuals should strive to shape the best outcomesin particular issues that come within their jurisdiction In the constrainedvision the inherent limitations of individuals mean that each individualsbest contribution to society is to adhere to the special duties of hisinstitutional role and let systemic processes determine outcomes Bycontrast the unconstrained vision was exemplified in Chief Justice EarlWarrens interruption of lawyers unfolding complex legal principles to askBut is it right Is it good In the constrained vision that was neither hisbusiness nor within his competence for the specialists superiority existsonly within a narrow range of skillsin this instance determining how thewritten law applied to the case at hand Burke said I revere men in thefunctions which belong to them78but not beyond Just as the unconstrained vision urges judicial activism on judges it urgessocial responsibility upon businessmenthat they should hire investdonate and otherwise conduct their businesses with an eye to producingspecific benefits to society at large The socially responsible businessmanshould for example hire the disadvantaged invest in things that seem mostneeded by society rather than those most profitable to his firm and turn partof the proceeds over to charitable and cultural activities rather than pay allthe proceeds out to the stockholders or plow them back into the business The constrained vision sees such things as outside the competence ofbusinessmen given the wider ramifications of such decisions in a complexsystemic process According to the constrained vision of human knowledgewhat is within the businessmans competence is the running of his particularfirm so as to promote its prosperity within the law It is the systemic effectof competition rather than the individual intentions of businessmen whichthis vision relies on to produce social benefit According to Adam Smith itis when the businessman intends only his own gain that he contributesvia the process of competitionto promote the social good moreeffectually than when he really intends to promote it Smith added I havenever known much good done by those who affected to trade for the publicgood79 The writings of those with the constrained vision abound with examplesof counterproductive consequences of wellintentioned policies But tothose with the unconstrained vision this is simply seizing upon isolatedmistakes that are correctable in order to resist tendencies that are sociallybeneficial on the whole However to those with the constrained visionthese mistakes are not happenstances but symptoms of what to expectwhen the inherent limitations of individuals are ignored and systemicprocesses for coping with these limitations are deranged by specifictinkering Sincerity Versus Fidelity Because of conflicting visions of how much knowledge a given individualcan have and how effective that knowledge can be in deciding complexsocial issues the two visions attach widely differing importance to sincerityand fidelity Where the wise and conscientious individual is conceived to becompetent to shape socially beneficial outcomes directly then his sincerityand dedication to the common good are crucial Godwins whole purposewas to strengthen the individuals sincerity fortitude and justice80 Theimportance of general sincerity81 was a recurring theme in Godwin andhas remained so over the centuries among others with the unconstrainedvision Sincerity tends to liberate82 according to Godwin and to bringevery other virtue in its train83 While conceding that everyone is insincereat some time or other84 Godwin nevertheless urged a general andunalterable sincerity85 as a powerful ideal capable of producing profoundsocial benefits Sincerity holds no such place of honor in the constrained vision Thosewith this vision often readily concede sincerity to their adversaries treatingit as an individual virtue of minor social benefitand sometimes as a majoraggravating factor when people persist in socially counterproductive idealsWhat is morally central to the constrained vision is fidelity to duty in onesrole in life There within the sphere of his competence the individual canmake the greatest contribution to the social good by serving the greatsystemic process which decides the actual outcomes This is an entirelydifferent conception of duty from that of the unconstrained vision whereones duty is direct beneficence to mankind86 But in the constrained visionthe individual wielding social decisionmaking power lacks the competenceto continually make ad hoc determinations of what specifically is good formankind however sincere he may be In the constrained vision the businessmans moral duty is fidelity to thestockholders who have entrusted their savings to him not sincere pursuit ofthe public good through charitable donations or investment or hiringdecisions which compromise that trust Similarly the judges moral duty isto faithfully carry out the law he was sworn to uphold not sincerely changethat law to produce better results as he sees them Within this vision ascholars moral duty is to faithfully promote the intellectual process amonghis students and readers not lead them to specific conclusions he sincerelybelieves to be best for society For similar reasons advocacy journalism orliberation theology are also anathema to those with the constrained visionsince both are seen as misuses of entrusted roles Sincerity is so central to the unconstrained vision that it is not readilyconceded to adversaries who are often depicted as apologists if not venalIt is not uncommon in this tradition to find references to their adversariesreal reasons which must be unmasked Even where sincerity isconceded to adversaries it is often accompanied by references to thoseadversaries blindness prejudice or narrow inability to transcend thestatus quo Within the unconstrained vision sincerity is a great concessionto make while those with the constrained vision can more readily make thatconcession since it means so much less to them Nor need adversaries bedepicted as stupid by those with the constrained vision for they conceive ofthe social process as so complex that it is easy even for wise and moralindividuals to be mistakenand dangerously so They may do the worstof things without being the worst of men according to Burke87 Related to the question of sincerity versus fidelity is the issue of roles orstructured relationships Fidelity to roles is central to the constrained visionfor in carrying out defined roles the individual is relying on the experientialcapital of nations and of ages in Burkes terms Among contemporaries heis leaving specific results to be determined by the values knowledge andcapabilities of others fulfilling his own role only to serve faithfully theprocesses which make this possible But in the unconstrained vision wherethe individuals own reason and sincerity are paramount roles are seen asneedlessly constricting Those with the unconstrained vision tend to deplorerole stereotypes to seek less structured situations to democratizeparentchild or studentteacher relationships to deemphasize titles andformalities All these patterns are consistent with their underlying vision of humancapabilities in ad hoc decisionmaking It is equally consistent for thosewith a more constrained vision of those individual capabilities to enlist rolesand rules which tap the results of unarticulated historical experiencethereby restraining existing incumbents in these roles Roles which involveenormous trustparentchild or doctorpatient roles for exampleare alsoroles that preclude sex for example and those with the constrained visionare especially outraged if this taboo is broken Others often are as well butsuch opposition is not logically compelled by the unconstrained vision Both sincerity and fidelity can be seen as aspects of honestybut as verydifferent aspects weighed differently in the opposing visions Theconstrained vision in particular distinguishes sincerity from fidelity to truthThe first thing a man will do for his ideals is lie according to J ASchumpeter88 It is one reason why sincerity is given such light weight inthe constrained vision A modern defense of judicial activism by AlexanderBickel clearly put more weight on sincerity than on fidelity when he urgedthat dissimulation was unavoidable89 and referred to statesmanlikedeviousness in the public interest90 When Bickel later turned againstjudicial activism he also shifted moral grounds now emphasizing fidelityover sincerity It was now a moral duty of judges to obey the manifestconstitution with improvements being left to the amending process91 Inboth positions Bickels conclusions were consistent with his respectivevisions The rationale for fidelity to the truth is very similar to the rationale forfidelity to roles In both cases one subordinates ones own ad hocconception of what would be best for society in the particular case toadherence to a broader systemic processaccepted canons of morality inthis instancein which one has greater confidence as to its longrunbenefits to society Here again it is necessary to note that none of the great historic visionshas been either 100 percent unconstrained or 100 percent constrainedDifferences of degree among unconstrained visions are often crucial asregards the significance of truthand of force In a very pure unconstrainedvision such as that of Godwin reason is so powerfulomnipotent washis characterization92that neither deception nor force was justified inpursuing the public good93 Thus even though the wisest and mostbeneficent might be on a far higher plane than most people as of a giventime their ultimate ability to gain public assent was virtually inevitable Butwhere the unconstrained vision of human potential postulates more resistantfrictions en route to realizing the goal falsehood and force become notmerely rights but duties for the enormous benefits of an irreversiblebreakthrough go on for centuries over which time the initial costs are to beamortized If one believes like Lenin that the level of popular consciousnessspontaneously achievable is inherently insufficient to the task94 then morefarseeing elites have an enormous historic role to play95 and must employwhatever means are necessary Although both Godwin and Lenin rejectedthe naturally evolved systemic processes which are central to theconstrained vision the differences in degree in their assumptions abouthuman knowledge and reason produce profound differences in kind as tothe role of truth and force Relations between believers in Lenins version ofMarxism and believers in democratic socialism have historically been verybitter A small shift of assumptions can have profound effects on the visionand on the action that follows from it Youth and Age With experience and articulated rationality having such vastly differingweights in the two visions it is virtually inevitable that the young and theold should be seen in correspondingly different terms In the constrainedvision which depends upon the least fallible guide of humanexperience96 the young cannot be compared to the old in wisdom AdamSmith considered it unbecoming for the young to have the same confidenceas the old97 The wisest and most experienced are generally the leastcredulous he said and this depended crucially on time It is acquiredwisdom and experience only that teach incredulity and they very seldomteach it enough98 By contrast when knowledge and reason are conceived as articulatedrationality as in the unconstrained vision the young have considerableadvantages Condorcet wrote in the eighteenth century A young man nowleaving school possesses more real knowledge than the greatest geniusesnot of antiquity but even of the seventeenth centurycould have acquiredafter long study99 In an unconstrained vision where much of the malaiseof the world is due to existing institutions and existing beliefs those leasthabituated to those institutions and beliefs are readily seen as especiallyvaluable for making needed social changes According to GodwinThe next generation will not have so many prejudices to subdueSuppose a despotic nation by some revolution in its affairs possessedof freedom The children of the present race will be bred in more firmand independent habits of thinking the suppleness the timidity andthe vicious dexterity of their fathers will give place to an erect mienand a clear and decisive judgment100   Children are a sort of raw material put into our hands according toGodwin101 Their minds are like a sheet of white paper102 The youngwere viewed by Godwin as a downtrodden group103 but from among themmay be found one of the longlookedfor saviors of the human race104However the constrained view which seeks prudent tradeoffs rather thandramatic solutions cannot seek prudence in youth for prudence wasregarded as the fruit of experience105 Nor was moral fervor a substitute Itis no excuse for presumptuous ignorance that it is directed by insolentpassion according to Burke106 Burkes American disciple JohnRandolph said I am not speaking to the groundlings to the tyros andjunior apprentices but to the greyheaded men of this nation    107 But tothose with the unconstrained vision old age merited no such specialconsideration According to Condorcet prejudice and avarice werecharacteristics common to old age108 SUMMARY AND IMPLICATIONS The distribution of knowledge in society varies greatly according to thedefinition of knowledge Where knowledge is defined in the constrainedvision to include vast amounts of unarticulated but vitally importantinformation and conclusions summarized in habits aversions andattractions as well as in words and numbers then it is far more broadlyspread through a society than when its definition as in the unconstrainedvision is restricted to the more sophisticatedly articulated facts andrelationships The constrained vision which sees severe limits on mansconscious rationality relies heavily on evolved systemic processes toconvey and coordinate the broad array of knowledge necessary for humansurvival and progress The unconstrained vision which sees greaterprospects for human mastery of knowledge sees in those with specialintellectual skills both the proof of its assumption and the vehicles ofknowledge and reason for promoting social improvement Articulation plays an important role in the dissemination of knowledgeas knowledge is conceived in the unconstrained vision Discussion is thepath that leads to discovery and demonstration according to Godwin109who as noted earlier also considered accuracy of language to be theindispensable prerequisite of sound knowledge110 But articulation playsno such crucial role in the constrained vision It has been the misfortunenot as these gentlemen think it the glory of this age that everything is tobe discussed Burke declared111 He had no use for pert loquacity112 andargued that even reason by frequent repetition loses its force113Hamilton was suspicious of skilled articulation which could be merepainting and exaggeration114 or artificial reasoning to vary the nature andobvious sense of words115 and noted that it is extremely easy on eitherside to say a great number of plausible things116 Hobbes declared thatwords are wise mens counters but they are the mony of fooles117Unarticulated social experience has remained a more effective guide tobehavior than articulated rationality in the tradition of the constrainedvision According to Hayek it is enough that people know how to act inaccordance with the rules without knowing that the rules are such and suchin articulated terms118 Articulate youth idealistic and trained in the latest and most advancedforms of knowledge as knowledge is conceived in the unconstrainedvision are a great hope for the future to those with that vision So areintellectuals Neither is viewed in this way in the constrained vision Whereknowledge is more expansively defined and consequently more widelydistributed as in the constrained vision intellectuals have no commandingadvantage over the common man According to HayekCompared with the totality of knowledge which is continually utilizedin the evolution of a dynamic civilization the difference between theknowledge that the wisest and that which the most ignorant individualcan deliberately employ is comparatively insignificant119   When Hayek referred to that little extra knowledge which intellectualspossessed120 he echoed a skepticism about intellectuals that goes back forcenturies among those with the constrained vision Hobbes like Smithfound little natural difference among men121 and such social differences ashe found were by no means always favorable to intellectuals The commonman according to Hobbes seldom engaged in meaningless words which hesaw as the hallmark of intellectuals122 Moreover the real differencesamong the quality of peoples decisions were due more to systemicincentives than to their individual knowledge or sophistication A plainhusbandman is more Prudent in the affaires of his own house than a PrivyCounselor in the affaires of other men123 In this view the incentivesfacing intellectuals were to demonstrate their cleverness rather than to becorrect in terms of results affecting other people According to Hobbesintellectuals study more the reputation of their own wit than the successeof another s business124 The arrogance and exhibitionism of intellectuals were likewise recurringthemes in Burke125along with the dangers that such intellectuals posed tosociety He spoke of their grand theories to which they would haveheaven and earth to bend126 Hobbes also saw those who thinkethemselves wiser and abler to govern as sources of distraction and civilwar127 Hamilton likewise saw intellectuals as dangerous because of theirtendency to follow the treacherous phantoms of an ever craving and neverto be satisfied spirit of innovation128 Even where intellectuals were notconceived of as positively dangerous to the social order their role as policymakers was seen in the constrained vision as often inferior to that ofordinary people John Randolph said that he knew men who could notwrite a book or even spell this famous word Congress who neverthelesshad more practical sense than any intellectual 129 But to believers in the unconstrained vision intellectuals are precursorsto their fellows in the discovery of truth130 in Godwins words Likewiseaccording to Condorcet the discovery of speculative truths is the solemeans of advancing the human race131 However those with a radicallydifferent conception of man knowledge and rationality see intellectuals asa dangernot simply to a particular society but to any society Chapter 4 Visions of Social Processes Differences in the vision of human nature are reflected in differences in thevision of social processes It is not merely that social processes are seen asmitigating the shortcomings of human nature in one vision and asaggravating them in the other The very ways that social processes functionand malfunction are seen differently in the two visions which differ notonly in their view of morality but also in their view of causation Social processes cover an enormous range from language to warfarefrom love to economic systems Each of these in turn comes in a greatvariety of forms But there are also some things in common among socialprocesses in general Whether viewed within the framework of aconstrained or an unconstrained vision social processes have certaincharacteristicsan order whether or not intentionally designed Socialprocesses also take time and have costs Each of theseand otheraspectsof social processes is seen differently in the constrained and theunconstrained visions ORDER AND DESIGN A pattern of regularities may reflect either an intentional design or theevolution of circumstances not planned by any of the agents or forcesinvolved in its emergence Trees or vegetation of different kinds may growwild at different heights on a mountainside or a garden may be laid outwith great care and forethought by a gardener Both visions acknowledgethe existence of both kinds of social processes but they differ on the extentefficiency and desirability of evolved orders and planned designs The Constrained Vision The contrained vision puts little faith in deliberately designed socialprocesses since it has little faith that any manageable set of decisionmakers could effectively cope with the enormous complexities of designinga whole blueprint for an economic system a legal system or a system ofmorality or politics The constrained vision relies instead on historicallyevolved social processes and evaluates them in terms of their systemiccharacteristicstheir incentives and modes of interactionrather than theirgoals or intentions Language is perhaps the purest example of an evolved social processasystemic order without a deliberate overall design Rules of language areindeed written down but after the fact codifying existing practices andmost people have begun obeying these rules in early childhood beforebeing explicitly taught them Yet languages are extremely complex andsubtle and of course vital to the functioning of a society Even for smallchildren language is not so much a matter of parroting what has beenexplicitly articulated but rather of inferring complex rules never fullyexplained1 Language is thus the epitome of an evolved complex order with its ownsystemic characteristics inner logic and external social consequencesbutwithout having been deliberately designed by any individual or council Itsrationality is systemic not individualan evolved pattern rather than anexcogitated blueprint Language is in effect a model for social processes in legal economicpolitical and other systems as viewed within the constrained vision2 It isnot that languages cannot be createdEsperanto clearly wasbut that theyare more effective when evolved because natural languages draw upon amore vast wealth of experiences over the centuries than will be at thecommand of any individual or council designing a language Evolvedlanguage also serves a greater multiplicity of purposes than any givenindividual or council may be able to enumerate much less weigh In much the same way the complex characteristics of an economicsystem may be analyzed in skeletal outline after the fact but the fleshandblood reality has often evolved on its ownand it is considered moreefficient when markets have evolved than when planned by centralauthorities Deliberate action or planning at the individual level is by nomeans precluded by the constrained vision just as individuals choose theirown words and writing style within the scope and rules of language Whatis rejected in both cases by the constrained vision is individual orintentional planning of the whole system Man as conceived in theconstrained vision simply is not capable of such a feat though he iscapable of the hubris of attempting it Systemic rationality is consideredsuperior to individual or intentional rationality The constrained vision is not a static vision of the social process nor aview that the status quo should not be altered On the contrary its centralprinciple is evolution Language does not remain unchanged but neither isit replaced according to a new master plan A given language may evolveover the centuries to something almost wholly different but as a result ofincremental changes successively validated by the usage of the many ratherthan the planning of the few In politics as well evolution is the keynote ofthe constrained vision Burke declared A state without the means of somechange is without the means of its conservation3 Yet he would not subjectwhole political systems to the mercy of untried speculations4 Individualbrilliance was no substitute for pragmatic adjustments even by people ofless brillianceI have never yet seen any plan which has not been mended by theobservations of those who were much inferior in understanding to theperson who took the lead in the business By a slow but wellsustainedprogress the effect of each step is watched the good or ill success ofthe first gives light to us in the second and so from light to light weare conducted safely through the whole series5   The same basic view has been expressed in the twentieth century by F AHayekTradition is not something constant but the product of a process ofselection guided not by reason but by success6   The Hayekian view is even further removed from deliberate design thanthat of Burke since Hayek incorporates a survival of the fittest cultureselection process which depends upon survival in competition with othersocial systems rather than simply on the basis of pragmatic individualjudgments of success7 The intervening influence of Darwin between thesetwo exponents of the constrained vision is apparent It is not however atheory of the survival of the fittest individuals but of the fittest socialprocesses The Unconstrained Vision Without the underlying assumption that mans deliberate reason is toolimited to undertake comprehensive social planning an entirely different setof conclusions emerges in field after field If for example effective rationalplanning and direct control of an entire economic system is possible then itis clearly more efficient to reach desired results directly in this way ratherthan as the end result of circuitous and uncontrolled processes Wheredesirability can be specified by a small group of social decisionmakersrather than depending upon a multitude of mutually conflicting valuesamong the populace at large then social issues become very muchanalogous to engineering problemsan analogy often occurring amongthose with this approach and equally often denounced from the opposingperspective of the constrained vision8 One of the most striking visions which conceived of social issues asessentially engineering problems was that of Thorstein Veblen This viewexpressed in a number of Veblens writings was crystallized and elaboratedin his The Engineers and the Price System Here he explicitly rejected thesystemic processes of the marketplacethe price systemin favor of directcontrol by the relevant experts the engineers Few others have carried thismode of thought to such a logical extreme but elements of it appear in anumber of later writers John Kenneth Galbraith for example like Veblenconceived of the pricing mechanism as inadequate and manipulated bypowerful interests if not wholly fraudulent9 Others with varying degrees ofskepticism about economic and other systemic processes have likewisetended to seek more direct control by those with the requisite expertise andcommitment to the public interest Advocates of industrial policy are oneof the latest in this tradition Not all seek a special role for engineers assuch but rely on an analogy between engineering problems and socialissues In the engineering analogy growing out of the unconstrained vision onecan begin with societys needs because it is possible to have an objectiveanalysis of what is really desirable10 The public interest can bespecified and therefore pursued rationally It is then a question ofassembling the relevant facts and articulating thema full presentation ofthe items we can choose amongto determine how to achieve theresulting goals Social issues thus reduce to a matter of technicalcoordination by experts11 Unlike the systemic vision in which there areinherently conflicting uses because of multiplicities of conflicting values inthe populace at large in this rationalistic vision select third parties canagree on what constitutes needs waste or the spoiling of the naturalor manmade environment In this perspective there are not only social solutions but often obvioussolutionsthough not necessarily easy solutions given the opposition ofthose with a vested interest in the status quo Truth and above all politicaltruth is not hard of acquisition according to Godwin What is required isindependent and impartial discussion by unambitious and candidpeople12 The nature of good and evil was in Godwins view one of theplainest subjects to understand13 What is needed is for good sense andclear and correct perceptions to gain ascendancy in the world14 Very similar assessments are to be found in later writers with theunconstrained vision Evil in the existing society is neither incurable noreven very hard to cure when you have diagnosed it scientificallyaccording to George Bernard Shaw15 International conflicts are likewiseneither inevitable nor inherently difficult to settle The issues in militaryconflicts are usually things which warring nations could have settled withthe greatest ease without the shedding of one drop of blood if they hadbeen on decent human terms with one another instead of on competitivecapitalistic terms16 Existing society is only an artificial systemsusceptible of almost infinite modification and readjustmentnay ofpractical demolition and substitution at the will of Man according toShaw17 Every successful private business was an example of the ease withwhich public ones could be performed as soon as there was the effectivewill to find out the way18 In short the intrinsic difficulties which dominate the constrained visionare not the real obstacle in the unconstrained vision in which deliberateobstruction and obfuscation account for many evils and in which what iscrucially needed on the part of the publicspirited reformers is commitment In Edward Bellamys famous social novel Looking Backward a citizen ofan advanced future society remarks to a man from the past on the singularblindness of the old society in which social troubles anddissatisfactions necessarily portended changes19 that things had to bedone in the common interest20 To take control of the economy was notdifficult for the larger the business the simpler the principles that can beapplied to it   21 Purely clerical devices provide all the information wecan possibly need22 A simple system of book accounts is all that isrequired23 Competition for resources was not intrinsic but due to a systemwhich made the interests of every individual antagonistic to those of everyother   24 Concepts of waste25 blindness26 and the public interest27abound along with repeated assertions of the intrinsic simplicity ofrationally managing a society28 More sophisticated modern versions of the unconstrained or rationalisticvision are variations on the same themes Even where societies areconceived to be more complex modern expertise is able to master thecomplexities making its central management still quite feasible Thus inmore sophisticated versions of the unconstrained vision whole societiesremain readily manageable though by experts rather than by the mass ofordinary people Thirdparty decisionmaking plays a key role Delegationto experts has become an indispensable aid to rational calculation in modernlife29 What is desirable or undesirable preferred satisfactory orunsatisfactory are referred to in passing without explanation asapparently things too obvious to require explanation30 Needs are alsotreated in the same way31 There are analogies given to engineering orscientific social decisionmaking by third partiesBureaucracy itself is a method for bringing scientific judgments tobear on policy decisions the growth of bureaucracy in moderngovernment is itself partly an index of the increased capacity ofgovernment to make use of expert knowledge32   This modern promotion of the use of experts echoes a tradition whichgoes back at least as far as the eighteenth century when Condorcet saw thephysical sciences as providing a model which the social sciences shouldfollow33 Indeed he used the term social science34 and urged thatquantification and theories of probability be used in formulating socialpolicies35 Another recurring theme in the unconstrained vision is how profoundlydifferent current issues are from those of the past so that the historicallyevolved beliefsthe conventional wisdom in Galbraiths phrase36canno longer apply Nor is this a new and recent conclusion In the eighteenthcentury Godwin declared that we cannot make todays decisions on thebasis of a timid reverence for the decisions of our ancestors37 Such termsas outmoded and irrelevant are common in dismissals of what in theopposing vision is called the wisdom of the ages The issue is not as to whether changes have occurred in human historybut whether these are in effect changes of costumes and scenery orchanges of the play itself In the constrained vision it is mostly thecostumes and scenery that have changed in the unconstrained vision theplay itself has changed the characters are fundamentally different andequally sweeping changes are both likely and necessary in the future PROCESS COSTS All social processeswhether economic religious political or otherinvolve costs These costs are seen very differently by those with theconstrained and the unconstrained visions just as they see differently thekinds of attitudes needed in these processessincerity versus fidelity forexample These costs may be due to time or to violence among othersources their corresponding benefits may be apportioned justly or unjustlyand their recipients may be free or unfree All these aspects are assesseddifferently in the constrained and the unconstrained visions Time The passage of time and its irreversibility create special decisionmakingdifficulties social processes and moral principlesall of which are seenquite differently by those with the constrained and the unconstrainedvisions Both recognize that decisions made at one point in time haveconsequences at other points in time But the ways of coping with this factdepend upon the capabilities of human beings and especially of humanknowledge and foresight Accretions of knowledge over time mean that individual and socialdecisions made under conditions of lesser knowledge have consequencesunder conditions of greater knowledge To those with the unconstrainedvision this means that being bound by past decisions represents a loss ofbenefits made possible by later knowledge Being bound by past decisionswhether in constitutional law cases or in marriage for life is seen as costlyand irrational The unconstrained vision therefore tends toward seeking thegreatest flexibility for changing decisions in the light of later informationIn arguing against Lockes concept of a social contract William Godwintook a position that was applicable to intertemporal commitments ingeneralAm I precluded from better information for the whole course of mylife And if not for the whole life why for a year a week or even anhour38   To Godwin One of the principal means of information is timeTherefore we needlessly restrict the effect of knowledge on our actions ifwe bind ourselves today to the conduct we will observe two monthshence39 Future commitments require a man to shut up his mind againstfurther information as to what his conduct in that future ought to be40 Tolive by anticipating future knowledge was to Godwin as improvident asliving by anticipating future income41 In the unconstrained vision there are moral as well as practicalconsequences to intertemporal commitments Gratitude as well as loyaltyand patriotism for example are all essentially commitments to behavedifferently in the future toward individuals or societies than one wouldbehave on an impartial assessment of circumstances as they might exist atsome future time if those individuals and societies were encountered forthe first time Where two lives are jeopardized and only one can be savedto save the one who is your father may be an act of loyalty but not an act ofjustice42 Thus in behavioral terms gratitude and loyalty are intertemporalcommitments not to be impartialnot to use future knowledge and futuremoral assessments to produce that result which you would otherwiseconsider best if confronting the same individuals and situations for the firsttime From this perspective loyalty promises patriotism gratitudeprecedents oaths of fidelity constitutions marriage social traditions andinternational treaties are all constrictions imposed earlier when knowledgeis less on options to be exercised later when knowledge will be greaterThey were all condemned by Godwin43 All were prior constraints on thatuncontroled exercise of private judgment44 which Godwin espoused The binding of judicial decisions by constitutions and legal precedentswas seen by Godwin as another example of intertemporal commitmentsbased on lesser knowledge impeding better decisions based on greaterknowledge that emerges later According to Godwins principlesAn enlightened and reasonable judicature would have recourse inorder to decide the cause before them to no code but the code ofreason They would feel the absurdity of other mens teaching themwhat they should think and pretending to understand the case beforethem before it happened better than they who had all thecircumstances under their inspection45   All those things condemned by Godwinloyalty constitutionsmarriage etchave been lauded and revered by those with a constrainedvision The process costs entailed by intertemporal commitments depend on1 how much more knowledge rationality and impartiality human beingsare capable of bringing to bear as a result of the passage of time and 2 onthe cost of accepting the disadvantages of momenttomoment decisionmaking Where the capability of greater knowledge and understanding isconsidered to be largeas in the unconstrained visionthe case foravoiding commitment is strongest Where this capability is considered to beinherently very limitedas in the constrained visionthe benefits arecorrespondingly smaller and more readily overbalanced by otherconsiderations In social principles especially Burke saw no fundamental advance to beexpected from the passage of timeWe know that we have made no discoveries and we think that nodiscoveries are to be made in morality nor many in the greatprinciples of government nor in the ideas of liberty   46   More generally the very concept of social science which largelyoriginated among those with the unconstrained vision beginning withCondorcet in the eighteenth century is often viewed skeptically by thosewith the constrained vision if not rejected outright as a pretentious delusionof being scientific where the prerequisites of science do not exist47Changing historically evolved principles on the basis of social sciencetheories or studies has become the hallmark of modern social thinkers withthe unconstrained visionand the bte noir of those with the constrainedvision Government according to Burke requires more experience thanany person can gain in his whole life48 Given this premise theincremental gain in individual knowledge by avoiding commitments istrivial compared to the gain to be made by fidelity to the accumulatedexperience of the society In a world where the individual is to be guided by the collective wisdomof his culture in accordance with the constrained vision culture must itselfhave some stability in order to serve as a guide Without this stability noman could know what would be the test of honour in a nation continuallyvarying the standard of its coin according to Burke49 The judicialsituation posed by Godwin may well lead to poorer decisions than if judgeswere completely free to decide each case ad hoc but the constrained visionoffsets such losses against the prospective guidance provided by knownrules leading to fewer criminal law violations or needs for civil litigationTo Burke the evils of inconstancy were ten thousand times worse thanthose of obstinacy and the blindest prejudice50 In short process costsarising from unreliable social expectations outweighed the value ofincremental individual knowledge or its more finely tuned application Given the perspective of the constrained vision a judge should not evenattempt to reach the socially best decision in the case before him Accordingto Hayek The only public good with which he can be concerned is theobservance of those rules that the individual could reasonably count onThe judge should apply the rules even if in the particular instance theknown consequences will appear to him wholly undesirable51 The cost isjustified only because other and larger costs are entailed by alternativesocial processes according to the constrained vision of human capabilitiesSuch a conclusion is however anathema to believers in the unconstrainedvision The courts will never permit themselves to be used as instrumentsof inequity and injustice according to a landmark court case52 Toknowingly accept injustice is unconscionable in the unconstrained visionBut in the constrained vision injustices are inevitable with the only realquestion being whether there will be more with one process than another To Adam Smith as well general stability was more important thanparticular benefits The peace and order of society is of more importancethan even the relief of the miserable Therefore even though he believedthat the rich and the great are too often preferred to the wise and thevirtuous he noted that determining the former involved lower processcosts so that the peace and order of society would rest more securelyupon the plain and palpable difference of birth and fortune than upon theinvisible and often uncertain difference of wisdom and virtue53 Once again where those with an unconstrained vision see a solutionthose with a constrained vision see a tradeoff The unconstrained visionseeks the best individual decisions arrived at seriatim and in ad hocfashion By contrast the constrained vision trades off the benefits of bothwisdom and virtue against the benefits of stability of expectations andstandards It may concede that one process offers abstractly betterindividual decisions but deducts the process costs of those decisions toarrive at a net balance which may turn out to favor the less prepossessingalternativepalpable distinctions of rank versus less perceptible differencesof wisdom and virtue for example This calculation need not always come down on the side of the statusquo many of the leading exemplars of the constrained vision wereadvocates of unpopular and sometimes drastic changes as noted in Chapter3 But the fact that better decisions in themselves were not sufficient tojustify change because of process costs provided a basis for those with theconstrained vision to reject many proposed changes that would otherwise becompelling on the basis of the unconstrained vision In short human beingsas conceived in the unconstrained vision should logically follow verydifferent policies from those to be followed by human beings as conceivedin the constrained vision Social rules are as central to the constrained vision as unfetteredindividual judgment and individual conscience are at the heart of theunconstrained vision As F A Hayek has put itWe live in a society in which we can successfully orientate ourselvesand in which our actions have a good chance of achieving their aimsnot only because our fellows are governed by known aims or knownconnections between means and ends but because they are alsoconfined by rules whose purpose or origin we often do not know andof whose very existence we are often unaware54   Commonly shared implicit rules thus reduce process costs But processcosts are less and less of a consideration the greater is the individualscapacity to decide each issue on its merits as it arises Rules thus range froma nuisance to an intolerable burden in the unconstrained vision Thedifference between the two visions is therefore especially sharp as regardsrules and practices relating to intertemporal commitmentsloyaltyconstitutions and marriage for example At the extremes the constrained vision says My country right orwrong while the unconstrained vision casts its exponent in the role of acitizen of the world ready to oppose his own country in words or actionswhenever he sees fit Patriotism and treason thus become a meaninglessdistinction at the extremes of the unconstrained vision while this distinctionis one of the most central and most powerful distinctions in the constrainedvision The constrained vision is premised on necessary and irremediableignorance on everyones part in the words of Hayek55 who also sees thatindividual rationalistic decisionmaking of the unconstrained visiondemands complete knowledge of all the relevant facts To Hayek thelatter is utterly impossible for the functioning of society depends uponsocial coordination of millions of facts which in their entirety are notknown to anybody56 To Hayek it is a delusion that all the relevant factsare known to some one mind57 making a decision and considering itswider ramifications In the constrained vision the benefits of an advancedcivilization derive from the better social coordination of widely dispersedfragments of knowledgenot from greater knowledge in the individualAccording to HayekIn civilized society it is indeed not so much the greater knowledge thatthe individual can acquire as the greater benefit he receives from theknowledge possessed by others which is the cause of his ability topursue an infinitely wider range of ends than merely the satisfaction ofhis most pressing physical needs Indeed a civilized individual maybe very ignorant more ignorant than many a savage and yet greatlybenefit from the civilization in which he lives58   In this vision it is especially unwarranted for the individual to placehimself outside or above the society which makes his life and hisunderstanding possible Even great achievements by an individual aredeemed to be necessarily confined to a narrow slice of the sweepingspectrum of concerns which a society coordinates and therefore provide nobasis for him to imagine that he can disassemble and reassemble in a betterway the complex society around him Their very excellence in theirpeculiar functions may leave such outstanding individuals less thanqualified in others according to Burke59 In a similar vein Hamilton arguedthat even the greatest genius would overlook decisive considerationswhich an ordinary man might see60 While the comparison between the intellectually or morally superiorindividual and average people is the relevant one from the standpoint of theunconstrained vision to those with the constrained vision even the mostoutstanding individualsintellectually or morallyare inherently verylimited in their grasp of the knowledge and of the innumerableinterrelationships which make a society viable Therefore in theconstrained vision the historic and systemic wisdom expressedinarticulately in the culture of the many is more likely to be correct than thespecial insights of the few Both processes mobilize human experience andunderstanding but in very different ways The very concept of reason isdifferent in the two visions In Hayeks wordsReason which has included the capacity of the mind to distinguishbetween good and evil that is between what was and was not inaccordance with established rules came to mean a capacity toconstruct such rules by deduction from explicit premises61   In the constrained vision society is often analogized to a living organismwhich cannot be comprehensively disassembled and reconstructed in adifferent way without fatal results Burke for example wrote of hacking abody into pieces and then throwing the pieces into the kettle ofmagicians in hopes of regeneration62 In the constrained vision theconcept of nationbuilding is a fundamental misconception63 Nations maygrow and evolve but cannot be built The intertemporal commitment of loyalty seen as an abandonment ofimpartiality in future behavior by those with the unconstrained vision wasviewed very differently by those with the constrained vision If ones viewof human nature is very constrained then the alternative to loyalty is notimpartiality but pure selfishness The kinds of emotional attachments whichlead to loyalty are thus seen as beneficial social ties essential to thefunctioning of the whole society According to BurkeTo be attached to the subdivision to love the little platoon we belongto in society is the first principle the germ as it were of publicaffections It is the first link in the series by which we proceed towardsa love of our country and to mankind64   In a similar vein Hamilton saidWe love our families more than our neighbors We love our neighborsmore than our countrymen in general65   By contrast Godwin put his faith in the spread of reason rather than abrute and unintelligent sympathy66 He distinguished undisciplinedfeelings from feelings that have ripened into virtuethe latter embracingthe whole human race in their concern From Godwins perspective thelove of our country is a deceitful principle which would establish apreference built upon accidental relations and not upon reason67 Neither vision regards the smaller units as intrinsically more importantthan the larger units The unconstrained vision simply regards man asultimately capable of understanding that principle and acting upon it Theconstrained vision sees that as beyond human nature in practice even ifagreed to in theory and that strong naturally arising emotional attachmentsmust therefore be socially utilized as a counterweight to personalselfishness Adam Smith for example rejected the rationalistic view whichwould attempt to establish directly the primacy of the species over thenationWe do not love our country merely as part of the great society ofmankindwe love it for its own sake and independently of any suchconsideration That wisdom which contrived the system of humanaffections as well as that of every other part of nature seems to havejudged that the interest of the great society of mankind would be bestpromoted by directing the principal attention of each individual to thatparticular portion of it which was most within the sphere both of hisabilities and his understanding68   As in his economic theories so in his moral theories Smith focused onindividual behavior precisely as it conduces indirectly to social benefitsnot simply because it benefits the individual This indirection in both caseswas due to Smiths conception of man as lacking either the knowledge orsufficient will to produce consistent social benefits directly Hamiltonlikewise considered selfishness as an unchangeable part of human nature sothat wise social policy could at best gently divert the channel and directit if possible to the public good69 Those without this constrained vision of human nature equally logicallyproceed in the opposite way by demanding an end of nationalism and anassumption of social responsibility by both individuals and institutionstoward ones fellow human beings whether at home or overseas Thegreater the capabilities of man the smaller the process costs and the moredirectly the social good can be pursued Freedom and Justice The two visions judge social processes by fundamentally different criteriaIn the unconstrained vision where individual intentions and individualjustice are central it is enormously important whether individual rewardsare merited or merely reflect privilege and luck Both individual leaders andsocial policies ought to be chosen with a view to their dedication to the goalof ending privilege and promoting either equality or merit But in theconstrained vision social processes are to be judged by their ability toextract the most social benefit from mans limited potentialities at thelowest cost This means rewarding scarce and valuable abilities whichinclude abilities which may be mere windfall gains to the individualspossessing them being in many cases either natural endowments or skillscultivated at prosperous parents expense but too costly for most peoplesmeans Sometimes the scarce and valuable traits to be rewarded mayinclude skills and orientations picked up almost by osmosis from beingraised in families where they exist In the unconstrained vision the social benefits of individual skills can beelicited without individually unmerited rewardsif not immediately thenin some better society to develop over time From this perspectivecontinuing to pay vastly different rewards retards the development of such asociety But in the constrained vision of human nature no suchdevelopment is likely to become general so that the injustice of payingunmerited rewards to individuals must be traded off against the injustice ofdepriving society of available benefits by not paying enough to provideincentives to their production and full utilization The two visions differ not merely in moral judgment but morefundamentally in their sense of social causation In the constrained visionthe crucial characteristic of any social system is the set of incentivesconfronting the individuals in it This includes not only the explicit rewardsand penalties of the marketplace and the law for example but also theinternal psychic rewards and punishments evolved by the culture and itsvalues Given an underlying human nature that is not fundamentallychanging these systemic characteristics largely determine individualendeavors These endeavors are not however directly realized Systemicinteractions are not simplyor even mainlythe fruition of individualplans Adam Smiths businessman is not alone in producing results whichwere no part of his intention While social incentives are more importantthan individual intentions in the constrained vision the specificcharacteristics of systemic interactionsthe elaborate principles andchannels of causation in a competitive economy for exampleare alsoessential to actual outcomes In short the constrained vision takes human nature as given and seessocial outcomes as a function of 1 the incentives presented to individualsand 2 the conditions under which they interact in response to thoseincentives These interactionsboth conflicting and cooperativeare toocomplex to lead simply to an average of the intentions of agents The resultsmay in fact reflect no ones intentions nor even an average of most peoplesintentions even if it is the best result achievable with the disparate valuesand conflicting claims made on inherently insufficient resources Morethriftiness can lead to lower savings for example as a result of thecircuitous effects of that thriftiness on aggregate demand productionemployment investment and income70 Similarly in the legal system morerights for particular groups can make those groups worse off71 Such unexpected results are not failures of a given system in theconstrained vision As limitations on man and nature are inherent sodisappointments are inherent In this vision the question is not whetherproblems are solvedthey will not bebut whether the best tradeoffsavailable have been made In the unconstrained vision human nature itself is a variable and in factthe central variable to be changed The fact that particular individuals orgroups have already exceeded the mass in intellect morality or dedicationto the social good demonstrates what is possible The great obstacles to itsachievement are the opposition of those benefiting from the existing socialorder and the inertia and blindness of others If these obstacles to progressare to be overcome it must be by the commitment intelligence andimagination of those who have grasped the possibilities open to society In contrast to the constrained vision which seeks to analyze prescribe orjudge only processes the unconstrained vision seeks to analyze prescribeor judge resultsincome distribution social mobility and equal or unequaltreatment by a variety of institutions for example Processes are oftencondemned because their actual results are deemed unsatisfactory whatevertheir abstract merits as processes For example the illusory nature offreedom or equality to the poor has been a recurrent theme of theunconstrained vision for centuries The classic expression of this view wasthat of Anatole FranceThe law in its majestic equality forbids the rich as well as the poor tosleep under bridges to beg in the streets and to steal bread72   Sometimes the inequality of results from apparently evenhandedprocesses is deemed to be deliberate hypocrisy at other times merely awrong result from an inadequate process In a similar vein one is notreally free in the unconstrained vision merely because the politicalprocess does not legally confine ones actions If the actual means ofachieving ones goals are lacking then there is no freedom in result even ifthere is freedom in the process In short the very definition of freedomdiffers between the two visions Regardless of the absence of legalrestraints one is not free by the definition of the unconstrained vision ifone cannot achieve his goals   73 For example Choosers are not free inthe market if high costs prohibit a choice that could be made available tothem by sharing the commodity through collective choice74 MoregenerallyOnes freedom finally depends on attaining important prime goals suchas dignity respect love affection solidarity friendship To the extentthat individuals lack these they cannot be free75   This resultsdefinition of freedom in the unconstrained vision isanathema to those with the constrained vision in which freedom is definedin terms of process characteristics Given the constrained vision of manswisdom and morality he cannot successfully prescribe results but can onlyinitiate processes whose consequences are often the direct opposite of hisintentions Moreover even where certain results may be causally attainablethey are not morally or intellectually justified independently of the processwhich brought them about Equality of results for those who havecontributed to production abstained from production and hamperedproduction is offensive to an equality of process in the constrained visionJustice is likewise a process characteristic in the constrained vision If afoot race is conducted under fair conditions then the result is just whetherthat result is the same person winning again and again or a different winnereach time Results do not define justice in the constrained vision To those with the unconstrained vision the best results should be soughtdirectly To those with the constrained vision the best processes should beused and protected because the attempt to produce the best results directlyis beyond human capacity The two visions original differences in theirassumptions about human nature dog their footsteps as they go from issueto issue SUMMARY AND IMPLICATIONS The two visions differ fundamentally as to the sources of human survivaland progress According to the unconstrained vision the patterned behaviorof society is successful just and progressive insofar as it reflects thearticulated rationality of man in general and of the most intellectually andmorally advanced people in particular Orderand especially a just andprogressive orderis the result of design backed by the commitment ofpeople dedicated to the general welfare In broad outline this is the visionof the age of reason which began in eighteenthcentury France and hasspread throughout the Western world and beyond In the constrained vision where manindividually and collectivelylacks both the intellectual and moral prerequisites for such deliberatecomprehensive planning order evolves historically without design andmore effectively than when it is designed Language is one example of suchorder without design and its complexity subtlety and effectivenessexemplify the power of systemic processes which tap the experience of allinstead of relying on the special wisdom or nobility of any individual orcouncil A prominent element within this tradition has applied theconstrained vision to economicsbeginning with the Physiocrats also ineighteenthcentury France whose battle crylaissezfaire was given itsfullest expression by Adam Smith and is exemplified today in the writingsof Milton Friedman and Friedrich Hayek Social processes in general are judged quite differently by the twovisions The unconstrained vision tends to judge processes by their resultsIs it right Is it good in the words of Chief Justice Earl Warren Theconstrained vision judges rightness and goodness as process characteristicsrather than as results A foot race is fair if it is run under the properconditionsregardless of who wins or loses or how often the same personwins Justice in the constrained vision thus means adherence to agreedupon rules while in the unconstrained vision something is just or unjustaccording to what end results occur According to Hobbes he that fulfilleth the Law is Just76 But toGodwin justice is a result flowing from the contemplation of eachindividual case77 Results define justice for Godwin because whatever isnot attended with any beneficial purpose is not just78 Clearly socialprocesses ultimately exist for or are justified by beneficial resultsin bothvisions The two visions differ in their respective estimates of mans abilityto directly produce those benefits The following of rules insteadwhetherlaws contracts customs or constitutionsis an inferior substitutejustifiable if at all only by the lower process costs involved Even if it canbe demonstrated in a given case that the result achieved by direct ad hocdecisionmaking is more efficient moral or otherwise desirable those withthe constrained vision will assess its process costs in terms of how thisviolation of rules deranges the expectations of many others and adverselychanges their future conduct as they lose confidence in the generalreliability of existing rules and agreements and future rules andagreements Whether the ad hoc benefits outweigh the systemic lossesdepends upon the capability of mannot only in law but in economicspolitics and other areas Freedom as well as justice is defined differently by the two visions forthis same reason In the constrained vision freedom is a processcharacteristicthe absence of externally imposed impediments Hobbesapplied this concept of freedom both to man and to inanimate things A manwas not free if chained or restricted by prison walls and water was not freeif hemmed in by river banks or by the walls of a container But where thelack of movement was due to internal causesa man fastened to his bedby sicknesse or a stone that lyeth stillthat was not considered byHobbes to be a lack of freedom79 The same concept of freedom continuesto characterize the constrained vision today Freedom to Hayek meansfreedom from coercion freedom from the arbitrary power of other menbut not release from the restrictions or compulsions of circumstances80 In the unconstrained vision however freedom is defined to include boththe absence of direct externally imposed impediments and of thecircumstantial limitations which reduce the range of choiceOnly when he can support himself and his family choose his job andmake a living wage can an individual and his family exercise realfreedom Otherwise he is a servant to survival without the means to dowhat he wants81   As already noted freedom may be so broadly defined in theunconstrained vision as to include not only economic prerequisites but alsopsychic benefits derivable only from emotional ties to others82 John Deweyperhaps best summarized this viewpoint when he defined liberty as theeffective power to do specific things83 With this definition whether thelimits on that effective power were internal or external deliberate orcircumstantial did not matter These radically different conceptions of freedom reflect radicallydifferent conceptions of human capability In the constrained vision whereman can at best initiate processes the most that he can do for freedomthrough social processes is to establish widely known rules which limit howmuch power is granted to one individual over another and limit the specificconditions under which the powerholder is authorized to exercise it But inthe unconstrained vision where man is capable of both shaping and judgingend results there is a corresponding right and duty to ensure that thoseresults maximize the scope of choice of individuals that they removeimpediments whether deliberate or circumstantial This may in some casesmean providing compensatory advantages to those whose socialbackgrounds would handicap them in competition with others whether fordeliberate or circumstantial reasons But to those with the constrainedvision this is not only beyond the competence of any individual or councilbut also an effort likely to derange the social processes to the generaldisadvantage and danger of society The complexity of social processes is a recurrent theme in both visionsbut in very different senses To those with the constrained vision it isaxiomatic that no individual or council can master this complexity so thatsystemic processesmarket economies social traditions constitutional laware relied on instead But to those with the unconstrained visionindividuals and councils can and must wrestle with social complexity Thesummary descriptions of systemic processes by their adversaries areconsidered simplistic since they do not specify particulars thoughspecifying particulars would be selfcontradictory under the assumption ofthe constrained vision which is precisely that no one is capable ofspecifying the particular The preoccupation with process characteristics among those with theconstrained vision extends to many specific kinds of social processes justas in all the same processes those with the unconstrained vision seekdirectly to create particular results Where there are for example peopleliving below some economic level defined as poverty those with theunconstrained vision tend to wish to subsidize them in some way to producedirectly a more desirable result in the form of a higher standard of livingThose with the constrained vision focus on the process incentives created bysuch schemes and their consequences on future behavior not only amongthese particular beneficiaries but also on others who may become lessassiduous in avoiding unemployment teenage pregnancy or other factorsconsidered as contributing to the general incidence of poverty Now that the analysis of visions has proceeded from the twofundamentally different assumptions about mans moral and intellectualpotentialities to the concepts of knowledge and reason appropriate to eachassumption and has now applied these concepts in social processes thebasic foundation for the conflict of visions has been established Whatremains to be built on that foundation are 1 more awareness of thediversity of visions and their dynamics and 2 special attention to visionsof equality visions of power and visions of justice which are central to theideological conflicts of the age These are the subjects of the chapters thatfollow Chapter 5 Varieties and Dynamics of Visions Thus far the discussion has centered on what might be called pure visionsor consistent visions clearly either constrained or unconstrained But asnoted at the outset these are by no means the only possible kinds of visionsThere are not only degrees in each vision but also inconsistent and hybridvisions Moreover beliefs in visions are not static Both individuals andwhole societies can change their visions over time These changes may besudden road to Damascus conversions where a particular event reorientsones whole thinking or the change may be more like water wearing awayrock so that one vision imperceptibly disappears to be replaced by achanging set of implicit assumptions about man and the world This secondkind of change may leave no clear record of when or how it happened norperhaps even an awareness on the part of those concerned except forknowing that things are no longer seen the same way they once were Some changes of visions tend to be associated with age The clich ofradicals in their twenties becoming conservatives in their forties goes backmany generations Karl Marx predicted that the Russian radicals he met inParis in the 1840s would be staunch supporters of the czarist regime inanother twenty yearsthough he clearly did not expect any suchconversion in his own case Although visions can and do change the persistence and vitality of bothconstrained and unconstrained visions over a period of centuries suggestthat such changes are not easy The anguish of the apostate comes fromwithin as well as from the condemnation of his former comrades Thosewho lose their faith but continue the outward observances or who quietlywithdraw if they can are likewise testimony to the power of visions and thepain of change The terms in which such changes of social vision arediscussedconversion apostasy heresyare borrowed from religioushistory though they apply equally to secular creeds which evoke similaremotional commitments No comprehensive survey of visions seems possible and none will beattempted here However it will be useful to consider a few kinds of visionsand the dynamics of visions in general But before surveying a variety ofvisions it will be necessary to define more specifically constrained andunconstrained visions OPERATIONAL DEFINITIONS No theory is literally 100 percent constrained or 100 percent unconstrainedTo be totally unconstrained in the most literal sense would be to haveomniscience and omnipotence Religious visions may ascribe omniscienceand omnipotence to God but that in itself constrains man and so precludesa completely unconstrained social vision A 100 percent constrained visionwould mean that mans every thought and action are predestined and wouldbe equally incompatible with advocating a particular social vision to befollowed Although the classic social visions considered here do not go to suchultimate extremes there are still very real differences in kind between themas well as differences in degree within each kind Once it is acknowledgedthat the dichotomy between constrained and unconstrained visions is simplya convenient way to separate some portions of a philosophical spectrumfrom others the question becomes one of choosing operational criteria forplacing a particular range of visions in one of these categories rather thanthe otherand of recognizing that still other ranges of visions cannot befitted into either category since constrained and unconstrained visions donot jointly exhaust all philosophies of man and society The simplest case is when someone such as William Godwin elaboratesthe scope of human reason and the individual and social decisions whichfall within its domain When the vast bulk of these decisions are deemed tobe amenable to deliberately articulated rationality then there is clearly anunconstrained visionnot in the sense that man is literally omniscient butrather that whatever limitations there are in human knowledge and reasondo not affect the analysis sufficiently to become an integral part of thetheory But few writers in either vision have systematically spelled out theirassumptions and the conclusions which follow from them as explicitly asGodwin Adam Smith incorporated his vision of mans limitations into his socialtheory explicitly in The Theory of Moral Sentiments and largely implicitlyin The Wealth of Nations Others vary greatly in the extent to which theyexplicitly state their vision of man or connect that vision with their socialconclusions But where two thinkers have virtually identical social analysesand advocacy to include one and exclude the other from the boundaries of aparticular set of visions on the basis of their elaboration or nonelaborationof their premises would be arbitrary Moreover it would be inconsistentwith our initial definition of a vision as a preanalytic cognitive acta setof assumptions not necessarily spelled out even in the individuals ownmind Seeking operational definitions of the two visions means going beyondsuggestive contrasts to decisive distinctions The difference between thetradeoffs commonly found in constrained visions and the solutions foundin unconstrained visions is suggestive but not decisive So too is thedistinction between seeking the social good through incentives rather thanby changing the dispositions of human beingsthis being a special case oftradeoffs versus solutions It is not simply the seeking of tradeoffs but thesystemic mode of tradeoffs which is at the heart of the constrained visionA central planning commission or an activist judge can make tradeoffs butthis is clearly not what the constrained vision has in mind howevercongenial that may be to the unconstrained vision The systemic versus the deliberate mode of social decisionmakingcomes closer to the central issue of human capability To allow socialdecisions to be made as collective decisions by given individuals acting assurrogates entrusted with the wellbeing of others is to claim a much largercapability for man than allowing those social decisions to be whateversystemic interaction produces from the innumerable individuals exercisingtheir own individual discretion in their own individual interests In short the two key criteria for distinguishing constrained andunconstrained visions are 1 the locus of discretion and 2 the mode ofdiscretion Social decisions remain social decisions in either vision but thediscretion from which they derive is exercised quite differently Socialdecisions are deliberately made by surrogates on explicitly rationalisticgrounds for the common good in the unconstrained vision Socialdecisions evolve systemically from the interactions of individual discretionexercised for individual benefit in the constrained visionserving thecommon good only as an individually unintended consequence of thecharacteristics of systemic processes such as a competitive marketeconomy Both visions acknowledge inherent limitations in man but the nature anddegree of those limitations are quite different The need for food the realityof death or the ignorance of newborn babes are of course readily concededby those with the unconstrained vision What distinguishes those with theconstrained vision is that the inherent constraints of human beings are seenas sufficiently severe to preclude the kind of dependence on individualarticulated rationality that is at the heart of the unconstrained vision Theknowledge the morality and the fortitude required for successfulimplementation of the unconstrained vision are simply not there accordingto the constrained visionand are not going to be developed either by themasses or by the elite The best kind of world for man as conceived in onevision is disastrous for man as conceived in the other vision Believers inthe two visions are thus foredoomed to be adversaries on one specific issueafter another Issues new to both of themsuch as compensatorypreferences for disadvantaged groupsevoke the same opposition betweenthem insofar as they depend on the implicit assumptions of differentvisions The Constrained Vision A necessary but not sufficient condition for a constrained vision is thatmans intellectual moral and other capabilities are so limited relative tohis desires not only for material things but also for justice and love forexample that his desires inherently cannot all be fully satisfied Howeverinsofar as mans reason is not only capable of grasping this in the abstractfor mankind but also of accepting it in the concrete for himselfindividually and of voluntarily adjusting to it there is no need for socialinstitutions or systemic processes to impose tradeoffs Tradeoffs freelyaccepted are essentially solutions Such a world would be like thatenvisioned for the future by Godwin and Condorcet It is the unconstrainedvision For a constrained vision it is necessary not only that 1 mans resourcesboth internal and external are insufficient to satisfy his desires but also that2 individuals will not accept limits on the satisfaction of their own desirescommensurate with what is socially available except when inherent socialconstraints are forcibly imposed on them as individuals through varioussocial mechanisms such as prices which force each individual to limit hisconsumption of material goods or moral traditions and social pressureswhich limit the amount of psychic pain people inflict on each other Thesecond criterionthe need for systemic processes to convey inherent sociallimitations to the individualapplies to all mankind including the wisestthinker the noblest leader or the most compassionate humanitarian Onlywhen all are included within the human limitations it conceives is theconstrained vision complete Man as conceived in the constrained vision could never have plannedand achieved even the current level of material and psychic wellbeingwhich is seen as the product of evolved systemic interactions drawing onthe experiences and adjusting to the preferences revealed in behavior ratherthan words of vast numbers of people over vast regions of time Theconstrained vision sees future progress as a continuation of such systemicinteractionsand as threatened by attempts to substitute individuallyexcogitated social schemes for these evolved patterns The enormous importance of evolved systemic interactions in theconstrained vision does not make it a vision of collective choice for the endresults are not chosen at allthe prices output employment and interestrates emerging from competition under laissezfaire economics being theclassic example Judges adhering closely to the written lawavoiding thechoosing of results per sewould be the analogue in law Laissezfaireeconomics and black letter law are essentially frameworks with the locusof substantive discretion being innumerable individuals The Unconstrained Vision The operational definition of an unconstrained vision in terms of locus ofdiscretion and mode of discretion avoids the ultimately impossible task ofdetermining just how unconstrained a vision must be to receive this labelEven the classic unconstrained visionssuch as those of Godwin andCondorcetacknowledged human mortality and the existence of erroneousideas which they actively sought to banish Success in this endeavor wouldlead ultimately to a society in which the necessary social tradeoffs wouldbe voluntarily accepted individually and so become for all practicalpurposes solutions Both Godwin and Condorcet acknowledged that evenin such a world mans biological capacity to generate an everlargerpopulation would contain the potentiality for producing catastrophicpovertybut their crucial premise was that this potentiality would indeedbe contained by rational foresight of the consequences1 There would be anabstract tradeoff but a practical solution It is unnecessary for the unconstrained vision that every single humanbeing individually and spontaneously arrive at this ultimate level ofintellectual and moral solution much less that they do so at the same timeor pace On the contrary those in the tradition of the unconstrained visionalmost invariably assume that some intellectual and moral pioneers advancefar beyond their contemporaries and in one way or another lead themtoward everhigher levels of understanding and practice These intellectualand moral pioneers become the surrogate decisionmakers pending theeventual progress of mankind to the point where all can make socialdecisions A special variant in Godwin is that each individual actsessentially as a social surrogate making decisions individually but withsocial responsibility rather than personal benefit uppermost in his thinkingThis tradition of social responsibility by businessmen universities andothers implies a capacity to discern the actual social ramifications of onesactsan assumption implicitly made in the unconstrained vision andexplicitly rejected by those with the constrained vision2 Central to the unconstrained vision is the belief that within human limitslies the potentiality for practical social solutions to be accepted rather thanimposed Those with the unconstrained vision may indeed advocate moredraconian impositions for a transitional period than would be accepted bythose with the constrained vision But the very willingness of some of thosewith the unconstrained vision to countenance such transitional methods ispredicated precisely on the belief that this is only necessary transitionallyon the road to far more freedom and general wellbeing than exist currently Moreover not all believers in the unconstrained vision accept even atransitional necessity for forcible impositions Godwin repudiated any useof force to bring about the kind of world he wished to see3 and Fabiansocialists such as George Bernard Shaw considered it wholly unnecessaryat least in England4 In both cases it was not merely that violence wasdeemed repugnant but that alternative methods were deemed effective Thegreater intellectual and moral capabilities of man in the unconstrainedvision permit a greater reliance on the direct creation of social results bythose with the requisite moral commitment and intellectual skills It is thislocus of discretion and mode of discretion rather than the presence orabsence of violence which defines the vision Although modes of discretion are related to the locus of discretion theyare distinct considerations Fascism for example heavily emphasizessurrogate decisionmaking but is not an unconstrained vision becauseneither the mode of decisionmaking nor the mode of choosing the leader isarticulated rationality It is not merely that nonfascists find fascism nonrational but that fascisms own creed justifies decisive emotional tiesnationalism race and the use of violence as political driving forces It isonly when both the locus of discretion and the mode of discretionconsistently reflect the underlying assumptions of either the constrainedvision or the unconstrained vision that a given social philosophy can beunambiguously placed under either rubric Operational definitions make it more feasible to place social theoriesespecially complex onesunder either constrained or unconstrainedvisions or to leave them out of both categories for these twin criteriaprovide a more definitive method than simply surveying an authorsisolated remarks on human nature It is after all not simply the presence ofparticular assumptions but the incorporation of those assumptions into thesubstantive analysis which determines the nature of a vision By the standards of locus of discretion and mode of discretion JohnRawls A Theory of Justice for example is an unconstrained visioneventhough its central theme is the tradeoff between equality and the need toproduce material wellbeing In Rawls the locus of discretion is thesurrogate decisionmaker society which can choose the tradeoffcollectively and arrange results in accordance with principles of justicethese principles being derived in explicitly rationalistic terms While theprinciples of justice are logically derived from the presumed preferences ofhypothetical individuals in the original position of the yet unborndeciding what kind of world they would like to inhabit5 the locus ofdiscretion in applying these principles is society or a collective wethat is surrogate decisionmakers Rawls unbiased unborn are similar in function to Adam Smithsimpartial spectator from whom principles of morality are derived in TheTheory of Moral Sentiments6 In both visions these hypothetical beings areused to circumvent the bias of individual or class selfinterest whenderiving social principles The difference is that Smiths impartialspectator is the conscience of each individual who remains the locus ofmoral as well as economic discretion within a framework of laws andother social constraints also reflecting the moral standards of the sameimpartial spectator In both visions the hypothetical being defines socialprinciples but the locus of discretion remains real peopleoperatingcollectively through surrogates in Rawls individually in Smith A socialframework is a collective product in either constrained or unconstrainedvisions but the ongoing exercise of discretion is what separates them intothe selfinterested individual decisionmakers of the constrained vision andthe collective surrogate decisionmakers of the unconstrained vision The terms collective decisionmaking and surrogate decisionmakingare used here more or less interchangeably though they are not preciselythe same Town meeting democracy for example would mean collectivedecisionmaking without surrogates even if officials then carried out thedecisions made by the town meeting Referendum government wouldlikewise make possible collective decisionmaking with official surrogatesbeing in principle agents rather than major exercisers of discretionHowever neither the constrained nor the unconstrained vision devotesmuch attention to such special cases which are not the situations ofcomplex nationstates Therefore for present purposes the collectivesurrogate decisionmaking of the unconstrained vision can be contrastedwith the individual selfinterested discretion of the constrained vision A given vision may fall anywhere on the continuum between theconstrained and unconstrained visions It may also combine elements of thetwo visions in ways which are either consistent or inconsistent Marxismand utilitarianism are classic examples of hybrid visions though in verydifferent ways HYBRID VISIONS Marxism The Marxian theory of history is essentially a constrained vision with theconstraints lessening over the centuries ending in the unconstrained worldof communism7 However at any given time prior to the advent of ultimatecommunism people cannot escapematerially or morallyfrom theinherent constraints of their own era It is the growth of new possibilitiescreated by knowledge science and technology which lessens theseconstraints and thus sets the stage for a clash between those oriented towardthe new options for the future and those dedicated to the existing societyThis was how Marx saw the epochal transitions of historyfrom feudalismto capitalism for exampleand how he foresaw a similar transformationfrom capitalism to communism This hybrid vision put Marxism at odds with the rest of the socialisttradition whose unconstrained vision condemned capitalism by timelessmoral standards not as a once progressive system which had created newsocial opportunities that now rendered it obsolete Marx spoke of the greatness and temporary necessity for the bourgeoisregime8a notion foreign to socialists with the unconstrained vision forwhom capitalism was simply immoral As in more conservativecompromises with evil Marxs temporary moral acceptance of pastcapitalism was based on the premise that nothing better was possiblefor acertain span of past history under the inherent constraints of those timesHis efforts to overthrow capitalism in his own time were based on thepremise that new options now made capitalism both unnecessary andcounterproductive But just as Marx differed from other socialists because he believed ininherent constraints he also differed from those like Smith and Burke whoconceived of these constraints as being fixed by human nature To Marx theconstraints were ultimately those of material production and the frontiers ofthose constraints would be pushed back by the march of science andtechnology Eventually the preconditions would exist for the realization ofgoals long part of the socialist tradition including the production anddistribution of output from each according to his ability to each accordingto his needs But no such principle could be simply decreed withoutregard to the stage of economic development and the human attitudesconditioned by it According to Marx it was only after the productive forces have alsoincreased with the allaround development of the individual and all thesprings of cooperative wealth flow more abundantlyonly then can thenarrow horizon of bourgeois right be crossed in its entirety and societyinscribe on its banner from each according to his ability to each accordingto his needs9 Marxs vision was therefore of a world constrained forcenturies though progressively less so and eventually becomingunconstrained Engels called this the ascent of man from the kingdom ofnecessity to the kingdom of freedom10 Marxian doctrine as it applies respectively to the past and the futurereflects the reasoning respectively of the constrained and the unconstrainedvisions Looking back at history Marxism sees causation as the constrainedvision sees it as systemic rather than intentional In Engels words whateach individual wills is obstructed by everyone else and what emerges issomething that no one willed11 When referring to the capitalist and precapitalist past individual intention was as sweepingly rejected as a sourceof social causation in Marxism as in Adam Smith or any other exemplar ofthe constrained vision12 Unlike many others on the political left Marx didnot regard the capitalist economy as directly controlled by the individualintentions of capitalists but rather as controlling them systemicallyforcing them to cut prices for example as technology lowered productioncosts13 or even forcing them to sell below cost during economic crises14Similarly bourgeois democratic governments were seen as unable to controlinsurgent political tendencies threatening their rule15 Marxian moral as well as causal conclusions about the past wereconsistently cast in terms of a constrained vision For ancient economic andsocial systems slavery and incest were considered by Marx to behistorically justified because of the narrower inherent constraints of thoseprimitive times16 Nor would the immediate postrevolutionary regimeenvisioned by Marx sufficiently escape constraints to decide deliberatelywhen to end the state rather systemic conditions would determine whenand how the state would eventually wither away17 Only in some indefinite future was the unconstrained world whichMarxism sought expected to be realized In speaking of that world andcontrasting its desirable features with those of capitalism Marxs languagebecame that of the unconstrained vision Real freedom of the individualto be realized under Marxian communism meant the positive power toassert his true individuality not merely the bourgeois freedom of theconstrained visionthe negative power to avoid this or that According to Marx and EngelsOnly in community with others has each individual the means ofcultivating his gifts in all directions only in the community thereforeis personal freedom possible18   Looking backward Marx and Engels saw the emergence of bourgeoisfreedompolitical emancipation from deliberately imposed restrictionsas a great step forward though not the final form of humanemancipation However such freedom was the final form within theprevailing order of things19that is within the constrained world beforecommunism as conceived by Marx Under capitalism Marx considered theworker to be only nominally free20 he was compelled by socialconditions to work for the exploiting capitalist21 Real freedom was thefreedom of the unconstrained vision to be realized in a future unconstrainedworld This freedom was defined as a result in the manner of theunconstrained vision not as a process in the manner of the constrainedvision Marx was not inconsistent in using the concepts of the constrained visionfor his analysis of the past and the concepts of the unconstrained vision forcriticizing the present in comparison with the future he envisioned Hisoverall theory of history was precisely that constraints lessened over timewith the advancement of science and technology and that social changesfollowed in their wake22 As a system of contemporary political advocacyit is an unconstrained visiona theory that the ills of our time are due to awrong set of institutions and that surrogate decisionmakers makingcollective choices with specifically articulated rationality are the properlocus and mode of discretion for the future Utilitarianism Utilitarianism was a hybrid vision in a very different sense from Marxismand to a different degree in its two chief proponents Jeremy Bentham andJohn Stuart Mill Bentham did not originate the basic concepts ofutilitarianism23 but he systematized them incorporated them into a body ofpolitical doctrine and founded both an intellectually and politically activeschool in early nineteenthcentury England John Stuart Mill was the leaderof the second generation of that school but was also very consciouslyseeking to incorporate into his philosophy insights from very differentschools of thought Mill was in effect seeking a hybrid vision Man as conceived by Jeremy Bentham was thoroughly relentlessly andincurably selfish24 But however severe this moral constraint mansintellectual horizons were vast In particular it was within mans power torationally structure the social universe so as to produce the result of thegreatest good for the greatest number The constrained aspect of theutilitarian vision consists of mans inherent moral limitations and theconsequent need to rely on better incentives rather than better dispositionsin order to reconcile individual desires with social requirements Benthamsown efforts were directed toward creating schemes of incentives to beenforced by government whose function was to promote the happiness ofthe society by punishing and rewarding25 This reliance on surrogate decisionmakers however seems to placeBenthams utilitarianism operationally in the category of the unconstrainedvision particularly since the mode of discretion was severely rationalistic26However Benthams advocacy of governmentstructured incentives did notextend to wholesale government control of the economy Indeed Benthamrepeatedly declared himself a believer in the laissezfaire economics ofAdam Smith whom he even chided for not carrying laissezfaire far enoughwhen discussing usury laws27 Bentham rejected surrogate decisionmakingin the economy where he argued that a free and rational adult should beunhindered in making any nonfraudulent financial bargain he chose28 Bentham was not consistently in the tradition of either the constrained orthe unconstrained vision However the work for which he is best known inlaw and politics reflects operationally the unconstrained vision though notto the degree of Godwin or Condorcet But Benthams less known and lessoriginal work in economics essentially followed the constrained vision ofAdam Smiththough not always with Smiths reasons The reason for notallowing legislators to redistribute wealth for example was not that doingsuch things properly was beyond mans intellectual and moral capabilitiesbut rather that there were specifically articulated reasons against itnamely that insecurity of property would reduce subsequent production29 John Stuart Mills respect for Bentham and his carrying onin modifiedformthe philosophy of utilitarianism which name he popularized30 didnot prevent him from criticizing the scope and contents of Benthamsvision31 or from deliberately seeking in Samuel Taylor Coleridge anopposite complementary and corrective social vision32 Mill did not shareBenthams contempt as Mill saw it of all other schools of thinkers33Indeed Mill was remarkable among social thinkers in general for the rangeof other social theorists he not only studied but utilized in forming his ownconclusions Even when dealing with theories which he considered to beclearly erroneous he was concerned with seeing that no scattered particlesof important truth are buried and lost in the ruins of exploded error34 Thisintellectual catholicity in Mill led to what might be characterized as either1 a finely balanced consideration of issues or 2 an inconsistenteclecticism In either case it makes it difficult to put Mill unequivocally inthe camp of either the constrained or unconstrained vision though thegeneral thrust of his philosophy was provided by the latter vision Indeedhe gave one of the clearest statements of the unconstrained vision in itsmoral aspectThere are there have been many human beings in whom the motivesof patriotism or of benevolence have been permanent steady principlesof action superior to any ordinary and in not a few instances to anypossible temptations of personal interest There are and have beenmultitudes in whom the motive of conscience or moral obligation hasbeen paramount There is nothing in the constitution of human natureto forbid its being so in all mankind35   On a number of issues Mill boldly asserted conclusions which derivedfrom the unconstrained vision that laws are made not evolved forexamplefollowed immediately by provisos from the constrained visionthat these changes in the law will be hopelessly ineffective unless theyaccord with the traditions and customs of the particular people Similarlywith income distribution Mill combined both visions He asserted thatunlike laws of production constrained by diminishing returns laws ofincome distribution are not constrained While opinions and wishes donot affect production they are paramount when it comes to distributionThe distribution of output is a matter of human institutions solely MilldeclaredThe things once there mankind individually or collectively can dowith them as they like They can place them at the disposal ofwhomsoever they please and on whatever terms    The distributionof wealth therefore depends on the laws and customs of society Therules by which it is determined are what the opinions and feelings ofthe ruling portion of the community makes them and are very differentin different ages and countries and might be still more different ifmankind so chose36   This seems to be a clear statement of an unconstrained choice based onan unconstrained visionbut it only seems so Mills proviso in this case isthat the consequences of particular rules of distribution are beyond manscontrolare as little arbitrary and have as much the character of physicallaws as the laws of production37 Constraint has been explicitly repudiatedonly to be implicitly accepted A similar pattern of bold assertion anddevastating proviso appears even in Mills more narrowly technicaleconomic analysis where there is a ringing defense of classical economicson the causes of depressions and the role of money in themfollowed byprovisos which repeat essential contentions of the critics38 Much of Mills rhetoric is the rhetoric of the unconstrained vision Hisprovisos from the constrained vision make the classification of his overallposition ambiguous SUMMARY AND IMPLICATIONS There are many striking features of constrained and unconstrained visionswhich however do not define them The role of articulation the relativeimportance of external incentives versus internal dispositions indetermining human conduct the meanings of knowledge and of reason therole of fidelity versus sincerityall these show characteristic differencesbetween those with the constrained vision and those with the unconstrainedvision However none of these specific features defines the two visionsWhat is at the heart of the difference between them is the question as towhether human capabilities or potential permit social decisions to be madecollectively through the articulated rationality of surrogates so as toproduce the specific social results desired The crucial issue is ultimatelynot what specifically is desired a question of value premises but what canin fact be achieved a factual and causeandeffect question though inpractical terms goals deemed unachievable are rejected even if conceded tobe morally superior in the abstract In the chapters that follow even suchapparently valueladen concerns as equality power and justice are analyzedas essentially questions about assumed facts and assumed chains of causeand effect Pending the ultimate achievement of an unconstrained society the locusof discretion in the unconstrained vision is the surrogate decisionmakerindividual or institutional choosing a collective optimum whether ineconomics law or politics and whether for a limited range of decisions orfor the structuring of the whole society By contrast in the constrainedvision the loci of discretion are virtually as numerous as the populationAuthorities exist but their role is essentially to preserve a social frameworkwithin which others exercise discretion The entire spectrum of social visions cannot be neatly dichotomized intothe constrained and the unconstrained though it is remarkable how manyleading visions of the past two centuries fit into these two categoriesMoreover this dichotomy extends across moral economic legal and otherfields This is highlighted by the fact that those economists for examplewho hold the constrained vision in their own field tend also to take aconstrained vision of law and politics while those with the unconstrainedvision of law for example tend to favor economic and political policieswhich are also consistent with the unconstrained vision This will becomemore apparent in the chapters that follow Contemporary examples of thisconsistency across fields are no longer as numerous simply because socialthinkers who operate across disciplinary lines are not as numerous Theincreasing specialization of modern times makes the kind of sweepingvisions of the eighteenth century less common today Contemporary visionsare more likely to be confined to a particular fieldjudicial activism inlaw or laissezfaire in economics for examplethough there have been asmall and dwindling number of twentiethcentury thinkers such as GunnarMyrdal or Friedrich Hayek whose writings on a wide range of issues havegone well beyond a single intellectual discipline However what makes avision a vision is not its scope but its coherencethe consistency betweenits underlying premises and its specific conclusions whether thoseconclusions cover a narrow or a broad range Nevertheless despite the scope and consistency of both constrained andunconstrained visions there are some other very important social visionsMarxism and utilitarianism for examplewhich do not fit into eithercategory completely In addition one of the hybrid visions which has had aspectacular rise and fall in the twentieth century is fascism Here some ofthe key elements of the constrained visionobedience to authority loyaltyto ones people willingness to fightwere strongly invoked but alwaysunder the overriding imperative to follow an unconstrained leader under noobligation to respect laws traditions institutions or even common decencyThe systemic processes at the core of the constrained vision were negatedby a totalitarianism directed against every independent social process fromreligion to political or economic freedom Fascism appropriated some of thesymbolic aspects of the constrained vision without the systemic processeswhich gave them meaning It was an unconstrained vision of governancewhich attributed to its leaders a scope of knowledge and dedication to thecommon good wholly incompatible with the constrained vision whosesymbols it invoked Adherents of both the constrained and the unconstrained visions each seefascism as the logical extension of the adversarys vision To those on thepolitical left fascism is the far right Conversely to Hayek Hitlersnational socialism Nazism was indeed socialist in concept andexecution Inconsistent and hybrid visions make it impossible to equate constrainedand unconstrained visions simply with the political left and right Marxismepitomizes the political left but not the unconstrained vision which isdominant among the nonMarxist left Groups such as the libertarians alsodefy easy categorization either on a leftright continuum or in terms of theconstrained and unconstrained visions While contemporary libertarians areidentified with the tradition exemplified by F A Hayek and going back toAdam Smith they are in another sense closer to William Godwinsatomistic vision of society and of decisionmaking dominated byrationalistic individual conscience than to the more organic conceptions ofsociety found in Smith and Hayek Godwins views on war see Chapter 7also put him much closer to the pacifist tendency in libertarianism than toSmith or Hayek These conflicting elements in libertarianism are veryrevealing as to the difference made by small shifts of assumptions Godwins profound sense of a moral obligation to take care of onesfellow man39 never led him to conclude that the government was theinstrumentality for discharging this obligation He therefore had no desire todestroy private property40 or to have the government manage the economyor redistribute income In supporting private property and a free marketGodwin was at one with Smith with Hayek and with modernlibertarianism But in his sense of a pervasive moral responsibility to onesfellow man he was clearly at the opposite pole from those libertarians whofollow Ayn Rand for example It was the power of reason which made itunnecessary for government to take on the task of redistribution inGodwins vision for individuals were capable eventually of voluntarilysharing on their own But were reason considered just a little less potent orselfishness just a little more recalcitrant the arguments and vision ofGodwin could be used to support socialism or other radicallyredistributionist political philosophies Historically the general kind ofvision found in Godwin has been common on the political left among thoseskeptical of the free market and advocating more government intervention Logically one can be a thorough libertarian in the sense of rejectinggovernment control and yet believe that private decisionmaking should asa matter of morality be directed toward altruistic purposes It is equallyconsistent to see this atomistic freedom as the means to pursue purelypersonal wellbeing In these senses both William Godwin and Ayn Randcould be included among the contributors to libertarianism The unconstrained vision is clearly at home on the political left asamong G B Shaw and the other Fabians for example or in EdwardBellamys Looking Backward or in the contemporary writings of JohnKenneth Galbraith in economics or of Ronald Dworkin and Laurence Tribeon the law But the constrained vision while opposed to such philosophiesis also incompatible with the atomism of thoroughgoing libertarians In theconstrained vision the individual is allowed great freedom precisely inorder to serve social endswhich may be no part of the individualspurposes Property rights for example are justified within the constrainedvision not by any morally superior claims of the individual over society butprecisely by claims for the efficiency or expediency of making socialdecisions through the systemic incentives of market processes rather thanby central planning Smith had no difficulty with the right of society toregulate individual behavior for the common good as in fire regulations41for example and Oliver Wendell Holmes declared that the public welfaremay call upon the best citizens for their lives42 Neither the leftright dichotomy nor the dichotomy between constrainedand unconstrained visions turns on the relative importance of theindividuals benefit and the common good All make the common goodparamount though they differ completely as to how it is to be achieved Inshort it is not a moral value premise which divides them but theirdifferent empirical assumptions as to human nature and social cause andeffect Another complication in making these dichotomies of social philosophyis that many twentiethcentury institutions or legal precedents representthinking that is liberal in American terms or socialdemocratic inEuropean terms so that conservatives who oppose these institutions orprecedents are often confronted with the argument that such things arehere to stay essentially a conservative principle Those on the politicalright may thus end up arguing on the ground of the political left thatcertain policies are irrational while the left defends them as part of theaccepted social fabric the traditional position of the right While these might be simply tactical debating positions in some casesthere is a very real philosophic difficulty as well At the extreme the longstanding institutions of the Soviet Union were part of the social fabric ofthat society and communists who opposed reforming them were sometimesconsidered to be conservative Among fervent American supporters of thefreemarket principle libertarians are often at odds with conservatives onwelfare state institutions including labor unions which are now part of theAmerican social fabrican argument which carries little or no weight inlibertarian thinking though some conservatives find it important While it is useful to realize that such complications exist it is alsonecessary to understand that a very fundamental conflict between twovisions has persisted as a dominant ideological phenomenon for centuriesand shows no signs of disappearing The inevitable compromises ofpractical daytoday politics are more in the nature of truces than of peacetreaties Like other truces they break down from time to time in variousparts of the world amid bitter recriminations or even bloodshed The general patterns of social visions sketched in these chapters in Part Iprovide a framework for looking more deeply into the application ofconstrained and unconstrained visions to highly controversial issuesinvolving equality power and justice in the chapters that follow in Part IIFinally the role of visions will be assessed against related but very differentconcepts such as value premises and paradigms PART II APPLICATIONS Chapter 6 Visions of Equality Equality like freedom and justice is conceived in entirely different termsby those with the constrained vision and those with the unconstrainedvision Like freedom and justice equality is a process characteristic in theconstrained vision and a result characteristic in the unconstrained vision From Edmund Burke in the eighteenth century to Friedrich Hayek in thetwentieth century the constrained vision has seen equality in terms ofprocesses In Burkes words all men have equal rights but not to equalthings1 Alexander Hamilton likewise considered all men to be entitledto a parity of privileges2 though he expected that economic inequalitywould exist as long as liberty existed3 A social process which assuresequal treatment thus represents equality as seen in the constrained visionwhether or not the actual results are equal Equal treatment according toHayek has nothing to do with the question whether the application of suchgeneral rules in a particular situation may lead to results which are morefavourable to one group than to the others4 There are for Hayekirremediable inequalities5 just as there is irremediable ignorance oneveryones part6 The constrained vision of man leads to a constrained concept of equalityas a process within mans capabilities in contrast to a results definition ofequality which would require vastly more intellectual and moral capacitythan that assumed The argument is not that it is literally impossible toreduce or eliminate specific instances of inequality but that the veryprocesses created to do so generate other inequalities including dangerousinequalities of power caused by expanding the role of government MiltonFriedman exemplified this aspect of the constrained vision when he saidA society that puts equalityin the sense of equality of outcomeahead of freedom will end up with neither equality nor freedom Theuse of force to achieve equality will destroy freedom and the forceintroduced for good purposes will end up in the hands of people whouse it to promote their own interests7   But to those with the unconstrained vision such dangers are avoidable ifnot illusory and therefore to stop at purely formal processequality is bothneedless and inexcusable What could be more desirable and justGodwin asked than that the output of society to which all contributeshould with some degree of equality be shared among them8 Bothvisions recognize degrees of equality so the disagreement between them isnot over absolute mathematical equality versus some degree ofequalization but rather over just what it is that is to be equalized In theunconstrained vision the results are to be equalizedto one degree oranotherwhereas the equality of a constrained vision is the equalization ofprocesses Godwin was prepared to concede some advantages to talents andwealth9 though other believers in the unconstrained vision varied in howfar they would go in this direction What they shared was a concept ofequalityof whatever degreeas being equality of result When Godwinlamented seeing the wealth of a province spread upon the great manstable while his neighbors have not bread to satiate the cravings ofhunger10 he voiced a lament echoed many times throughout the history ofthe unconstrained vision Even when equality is phrased as equality of opportunity or equalitybefore the law it still has different meanings in the two visions Althoughthese concepts are expressed in prospective rather than retrospective termsthey can be either 1 prospects of achieving a given result or 2 prospectsof being treated a given way by the rules of the process So long as the process itself treats everyone the samejudges them bythe same criteria whether in employment or in a courtroomthen there isequality of opportunity or equality before the law as far as the constrainedvision is concerned But to those with the unconstrained vision to apply thesame criteria to those with radically different wealth education or pastopportunities and cultural orientations is to negate the meaning of equalityas they conceive it To them equality of opportunity means equalizedprobabilities of achieving given results whether in education employmentor the courtroom This may require the social process to provide compensatory advantagesto some whether in the form of special educational programs employmentpreference policies or publicly paid attorneys Though the specific issues ofaffirmative action or comparable worth are quite recent in history thethinking and the vision behind them go back at least as far as the eighteenthcentury According to Condorcet a real equality requires that even thenatural differences between men will be mitigated by social policy11Without equalized probabilities of achieving given results formal equalitywas inadequateif not hypocriticalaccording to the unconstrainedvision George Bernard Shaw for example ridiculed formal equality ofopportunityGive your son a fountain pen and a ream of paper and tell him that henow has an equal opportunity with me of writing plays and see what hesays to you12   Those with the unconstrained vision see no need to neglect at least tryingefforts toward equalizing chances for particular results But to those withthe constrained vision attempting to single out special individual or groupbeneficiaries is opening the floodgates to a dangerous principle whoseramifications go beyond the intentions or control of those initiating such aprocess Again it was not argued that it is literally impossible to reducespecified inequalities seriatim but rather that the generation of newinequalities by this process defeats the overall purpose and createsadditional difficulties and dangers A landmark US Supreme Courtdecision on preferential treatment rejected the idea that ethnic groups couldbe ranked by the levels of historic injustice suffered and the compensatorypreferences to which they were correspondingly entitledAs these preferences began to have their desired effect and theconsequences of past discrimination were undone new judicialrankings would be necessary The kind of variable sociological andpolitical analysis necessary to produce such rankings simply does notlie within the judicial competence   13   The unconstrained vision was expressed by an opposing Justice in thesame case without regard to this argument Instead a lengthy elaboration ofhistoric injustices and handicaps suffered was cited as arguments forcompensatory preferences to achieve equalization of prospects14 The twovisions argued past each other CAUSATION For equality to become an issue between the two visions there must first beinequality The existence and persistence of inequality is causally explainedvery differently by those with the constrained vision and those with theunconstrained vision Many leading exponents of a constrained vision donot explain inequality of result at all while many leading exponents of anunconstrained vision find such inequality both intellectually and morallycentral It is not only the existence and persistence of unequal results which havelong held the attention of those with the unconstrained vision but themagnitude of these differences as well For Godwin the inequality ofproperty ownership was at an alarming height15 To Shaw for one personto receive three thousand times the rate of pay of another has no moralsense in it16 Moreover it is not only the magnitude of unequal results butthe source According to Shaw landlords have become fabulously richsome of them taking every day for doing nothing more than many awoman of sixty years drudgery17 Capitalists likewise were conceived toprosper in much the same way profit being considered simplyovercharge18 It was not merely that some have little and others have much Cause andeffect are involved Some have little because others have much accordingto this reasoning which has been part of the unconstrained vision forcenturies In one way or another the rich have taken from the poorAccording to Godwin the great wealth of some derives from taking fromothers the means of a happy and respectable existence19 Such reasoninghas been applied internationally as well as domestically Imperial Britainwas thus a parasite on foreign labor according to Shaw20 The correctionof such exploitation has been a central concern in the unconstrained vision The theme of unjustified taking is not limited to direct employeremployee relationships to businessconsumer relationships or toimperialistandcolony relationships When those incapacitated for workthose less endowed with bodily strength or mental powerdo not sharefully in the fruits of society they are not merely denied compassion butrobbed of rights according to Edward Bellamy for most of what makesmodern prosperity possible comes from the efforts of past generationsHow did you come to be possessors of this knowledge and thismachinery which represent nine parts to one contributed by yourself inthe value of your product You inherited it did you not And were notthese others these unfortunate and crippled brothers whom you castout joint inheritors coheirs with you Did you not rob them whenyou put them off with crusts who were entitled to sit with the heirsand did you not add insult to robbery when you called the crustscharity21   The thesis that material deprivation has been aggravated by the inflictionof psychic pain has long been a recurring theme in the unconstrained visionIn the eighteenth century Godwin declaredHuman beings are capable of enduring with chearfulness considerablehardships when those hardships are impartially shared with the rest ofthe society and they are not insulted with the spectacle of indolenceand ease in others no way deserving of better advantages thanthemselves But it is a bitter aggravation of their own calamity to havethe privileges of others forced on their observation and while they areperpetually and vainly endeavouring to secure for themselves and theirfamilies the poorest conveniences to find others revelling in the fruitsof their labors22   Awareness of inequalities and revulsion toward them have not beenconfined to those with the unconstrained vision Similar reactions have beencommon to Adam Smith in the eighteenth century and to Milton Friedmanin the twentieth century23 In Friedmans wordsEverywhere in the world there are gross inequities in income andwealth They offend most of us Few can fail to be moved by thecontrast between the luxury enjoyed by some and the grinding povertysuffered by others24   While both Smith and Friedman as well as others with the constrainedvision have proposed various ameliorative schemes to help the poor25neither was prepared to make fundamental changes in the social processesin hopes of greater equalization A vision of constrained options and greaterdangers in alternative processes limits the scope of remedies Moreoverthese inequalities were not assumed to be products of the given socialsystem which Friedman saw as mitigating rather than aggravating thembut as a common misfortune far worse in other systems According toFriedman Wherever the free market has been permitted to operatewherever anything approaching equality of opportunity has existed theordinary man has been able to attain levels of living never dreamed ofbefore26 While the material abundance of modern capitalist nations hascreated fortunes here and there its main beneficiaries have been ordinaryrather than wealthy people according to Friedman Modern technologicalwonders brought little improvement to what the rich already had howevermuch they revolutionized the lives of the massesThe rich in Ancient Greece would have benefitted little from modernplumbing running servants replaced running water Television andradiothe patricians of Rome could enjoy the leading musicians andactors in their home could have the leading artists as domesticretainers Readytowear clothing supermarketsall these and manyother modern developments would have added little to their life Theywould have welcomed the improvements in transportation and inmedicine but for the rest the great achievements of Westerncapitalism have redounded primarily to the benefit of the ordinaryperson27   In the constrained vision of Friedman and others exploitationsituations have been seen as more effectively eliminated by the systemiccharacteristics of a competitive economy than by the deliberate interventionof political leaders in complex economic processes that they cannotcomprehend The danger was not only in the adverse consequences of theirintervention on the economy but still more so in the dire consequences ofsuch an increased concentration of political power In short attempts toequalize economic results lead to greaterand more dangerousinequalityin political power This was the central theme of Hayeks The Road toSerfdom where the goal of simultaneously combining freedom and equalityof outcome in democratic socialism was declared unachievable as aresult28 but dangerous as a process change pointing toward despotism Democratic socialists were not accused of plotting despotism and werein fact regarded by Hayek as genuinely humane individuals lacking theruthlessness required to achieve their social goals29 but were seen by himas paving the way for othersincluding both fascists and communistswho complete the destruction of freedom after the principles of equalitybefore the law and limitations on political power have been fatallyundermined in pursuit of the mirage of social justice30 As in other issues while followers of the unconstrained vision speak interms of the goals being sought followers of the constrained vision speak interms of the incentives being created by the processes being changed Irremediable ignorance and irremediable inequality go hand in handaccording to Hayek It is precisely our inescapable ignorance that makesgeneral rules necessary31 and general rules of social processes areincompatible with explicit determination of particular individual or groupresults Those who postulate a personified society32 assume an intentionpurpose and corresponding moral responsibility where there is in fact anevolved orderand the particulars of a spontaneous order cannot be justor unjust33 Government as a deliberately created entity may act onintention and be morally judged by its acts but not society34 Governmentas a limited set of decisionmakers cannot possess all the knowledge in asociety or anything approaching it and therefore lacks the omniscience infact to prescribe just or equal results A society of omniscient persons would have no need for a processconception of justice or equality The social justice of the unconstrainedvision could be imposed or agreed to in such a society whereHayekconcedesevery action would have to be judged as a means of bringingabout known effects35 But the constrained vision of human knowledgeprecludes the existence of a society with any such capability so that themoral criteria appropriate to such a society become moot The moralprinciples insisted upon by those with the unconstrained vision are thusrejected not as wrong but as irrelevant to the social choices actuallyavailable and dangerous in the concentration of governmental powerimplied by the pursuit of such ideals Because it is absurd to demand social justice from an uncontrolledprocess according to Hayek36 such a demand implies the substitution of avery different kind of process The moral issue thus becomes one of therelative merits of alternative processes Hayek questioned whether it ismoral that men be subjected to the power of direction that would have to beexercised in order that the benefits derived by the individuals could bemeaningfully described as just or unjust37 In short the constrained vision does not defend existing inequalities orany given pattern of economic or social results as just According toHayek the manner in which the benefits and burdens are apportioned bythe market mechanism would in many instances have to be regarded as veryunjust if it were the result of a deliberate allocation to particular people38The moral justification of the market process rests on the general prosperityand freedom it produces The issue between the two visions is not simply one of the existencemagnitude and persistence of inequalities but also of the extent to whichthose inequalities are merited This issue like the others goes back forcenturies In the eighteenth century Godwin wrote of a numerous class ofindividuals who though rich have neither brilliant talents nor sublimevirtues39 The privileged and powerful readily become indifferent tomankind and callous to their sufferings40 A king is nothing but acommon mortal exceeded by many and equalled by more in everyrequisite of strength capability and virtue41 Garlands and coronetsaccording to Godwin may be bestowed on the unworthy and prostituted tothe intriguing42 His target was not simply inequality as such butespecially unmerited advantage43 Variations on these themes haveremained a prominent feature of the unconstrained vision In the twentiethcentury Shaw declared that enormous fortunes are made without the leastmerit44 and noted that not only the poor but many welleducated peoplesee successful men of business inferior to themselves in knowledgetalent character and public spirit making much larger incomes45 Because those with the unconstrained vision emphasize the unmeritednature of many rewards it does not follow that those with the constrainedvision assume rewards to be individually merited Merit justifications havebeen very much the exception rather than the rule and largely confined tosecondary figures such as Samuel Smiles Horatio Alger and SocialDarwinists like William Graham Sumnerall of whom have been explicitlyrepudiated by Hayek for example46 Nor was Hayek unique The leadingfigures in the tradition of the constrained vision have for centuries pointedout that many rewards are personally unmerited The moral justification ofthe constrained vision is the justification of a social process not ofindividuals or classes within that process They readily concede thatinevitably some unworthy will succeed and some worthy fail thatrewards are based only partly on achievements and partly on merechance47 This is a tradeoff they accept on the conviction that no solutionis possible But those with the unconstrained vision do not share thatconviction and therefore find acceptance of known inequities intolerable Although the two visions reach very different moral conclusions they doso not on the basis of fundamentally different moral principles but ratherbecause of their differences in analysis of causes and effects The causalreasons for the inequalities in the first place and the options available fordealing with them are radically different in the two visions Adam Smithand William Godwin were both offended by the privilege and arrogance ofthe wealthy and powerful in the eighteenth century as Ronald Dworkin andMilton Friedman have both been offended by the economic inequalities ofthe twentieth century48 The constrained and the unconstrained visionsdiffer however on the plane of causation as to what can be done about itat what cost and with what dangers Both visions agree that equality of process can mean vast inequalities ofresults and that equal results may be attainable only by causing processesto operate very unequally toward different individuals or groups Thedifferences between the two visions are in the priority that they attach toeach goaland that in turn reflects the extent to which they conceive ofman as capable of morally and causally determining the appropriate goal forsociety One of the bitter contemporary clashes between the two visions invarious countries around the world is over compensatory preferences forparticular social groups for purposes of enabling those groups to reachresults more nearly like those of more fortunate groups in their respectivesocieties Although this specific issue has emerged very recently as historyis measured it reflects a conflict of visions that goes back for centuries The relationship between equality and freedom is also seen in oppositeterms in the two visions In the unconstrained vision equality and freedomare not in conflict but are in fact twin applications of similar principlessometimes summarized as political democracy and economicdemocracy As results this is clearly so since equalization is central toboth concepts As processes it is by no means clear that it is so Theconstrained vision which focuses on processes sees a major conflictbetween allowing freedom of individual action and prescribing equality ofsocial results Moreover it is considered illusory in this vision to expect thatprescription of economic results can be achieved while maintainingfreedom in noneconomic areas49 KINDS OF EQUALITIES AND INEQUALITIES If individuals were all equal in their developed capabilities and shared thesame values and goals then equal processes could produce equal resultssatisfying both visions But neither vision believes this to be the case Somein both camps believe that innate potentialities do not differ greatly amongindividuals or groups but this does little to reconcile the conflict of visionssince it is not potentialities but the actual application of developedcapabilities which determines results No one believed in the innate equality of human beings more than AdamSmith He thought that men differed less than dogs50 that the differencebetween a philosopher and a porter was purely a result of upbringing51 andhe rejected with contempt the doctrine that whites in America were superiorto the blacks they enslaved52 Yet the social inequalities of wealth and statusthat have been burning issues in the unconstrained vision were of littleconcern in Smiths constrained vision of man in society He opposedslavery as a social process on both moral and economic grounds53 Butsuch general social results as differences in income and privilege were notdeemed sufficiently important to override the process goals of freedom ofcivil and economic action Nor was this a matter of partisanship for the wealthy and powerfulSmiths low opinion of businessmen has already been noted in Chapter 2He also repeatedly pointed out how the aristocracy royalty and theprivileged or mighty in general were foolishly worshiped by the masses54even to the point of imitating their vices55and how this huge psychicwindfall gain was taken for granted by its recipients who did not evenregard ordinary people as their fellow men56 A distinguished scholar oncepointed out that several socialist orations could be put together out ofquotations from Adam Smith57 But Smiths constrained vision of man andsociety led in the opposite directionto laissezfaire capitalism Adam Smiths sweeping egalitarianism was by no means unique amongthose with the constrained vision Alexander Hamilton for example hadsimilar views regarding the moral level of different groupsExperience has by no means justified us in the supposition that thereis more virtue in one class of men than in another Look through therich and poor of the community the learned and the ignorant Wheredoes virtue predominate The difference indeed consists not in thequantity but kind of vices which are incident to the various classes  58   To those with the unconstrained vision to say that people are innatelyequal but that vast differences in economic and social results exist and thatprivileges are both taken for granted and repaid only in arrogance is to saythat the existing society is intolerably unjust and must be drasticallychanged Some would say that such a system must be changed at all costsor by whatever means are necessary At the very least social mobilitymust be increased Smith reached none of these conclusions WilliamGodwin once more serves as a perfect counterexample of theunconstrained vision for he agreed completely with Smith on the innateequality of human beings59 on the inequalities of wealth and status60 andon the arrogance of privilege61 but reached opposite conclusions on theneed for drastic change though by entirely peaceful means in Godwinscase62 The difference between them was in their respective visions of manand of social causation Many of those with an unconstrained vision and a passionate oppositionto inequality of results assume that those who oppose them must be in favorof inequality of results either on philosophic grounds or as a matter ofnarrow selfinterest In reality those with the constrained vision may bepassionately devoted to certain processes freedom to choose the rule oflaw etc and only secondarily concerned with whether any particularresult is equal or unequal They may not be at all opposed to theadvancement of untouchables in India or blacks in the United States orsimilar groups in other countriesand may even have contributed effortstoward such advancement themselvesbut nevertheless fight stronglyagainst process changes intended by those with an unconstrained vision toaid such advancement While the belief that peoples capabilities are equal can be found amongexponents of both visions so can the belief that these capabilities varyenormously between social groups The view that races classes or sexesinnately differ greatly in capabilities would be a conclusion for which aconstrained vision would be necessary but not sufficient and is in factrejected by many for whom intellectual or moral constraints apply to allhuman beings without group distinction As for developed capabilitiesthese are often conceived as being far more unequal by believers in theunconstrained vision than by believers in the constrained vision As noted in Chapter 3 the distribution of knowledge and reason is vastlymore unequal in the unconstrained vision because its definition ofknowledge and reason as articulated information and syllogistic rationalityputs them much more in the province of the intellectual elite But thecultural conception of knowledge in the constrained vision makes it farmore widely diffused and the systemic logic of cultural evolution andsurvival in competition dwarfs to insignificance the special logical talentsof the intellectual elite Thus while the common man was seen by Hobbesto be more capable in some respects than his more highly educated socialsuperior63 and the latters social claims were at least viewed veryskeptically by Smith Friedman and Hayek a vast chasm between theexisting intellectual and moral capabilities of the common man and those ofthe intellectual elite has been an enduring characteristic of the tradition ofthe unconstrained vision In an eighteenthcentury world where most people were peasantsGodwin declared that the peasant slides through life with something of thecontemptible insensibility of an oyster64 Rousseau likened the masses ofthe people to a stupid pusillanimous invalid65 According to Condorcetthe human race still revolts the philosopher who contemplates itshistory66 In the twentieth century George Bernard Shaw included theworking class among the detestable people who have no right to liveHe added I should despair if I did not know that they will all die presentlyand that there is no need on earth why they should be replaced by peoplelike themselves67 While the unconstrained vision has featured egalitarianism as aconviction that people should share more equally in the material and otherbenefits of society it tends to see the existing capabilities of people as farmore unequal than does the constrained vision Among contemporaryeconomists proposing ways of advancing Third World nations out ofpoverty those representing a constrained vision P T Bauer and T WSchultz for example depict the peasant masses of the Third World as arepository of valuable skills and capable of substantial adaptations tochanging economic conditions if only the elite will leave them free tocompete in the marketplace68 while those further to the left politically suchas Gunnar Myrdal depict the peasant masses as hopelessly backward andredeemable only by the committed efforts of the educated elite69 It is only when estimating the potential intelligence of human beings thatthose with the unconstrained vision have a higher estimate than those withthe constrained vision When estimating the current intelligence of humanbeings those with the unconstrained vision tend to estimate a lower meanand a greater variance It is the greater variance which lends logical supportto surrogate decisionmaking whether in the form of more governmentplanning in economics judicial activism in the law or internationalagencyefforts at population control or control of natural resources under the seaCounterexamples can be found on both sides of course as for exampleamong the leaders of the French Revolution or V I Lenin in modern timesboth of whom praised the masses But the public statements of thoseholding or aspiring to power are hardly decisive evidence On the otherside Burkes famous outburst against the swinish multitude supportingthe French Revolution was atypical even of Burke70 much less of thetradition of which he was part More important it is the logic of each vision rather than the isolatedexamples which point in the direction each has tended to go Except forthat subset who are explicitly racist or Social Darwinists followers of theconstrained vision have no reason to expect the kind of vast differences incapabilities which are the logical consequence of conceiving knowledgeand reason in ways which make them accessible to the few but not to themany There is no need to question the sincerity of those with theunconstrained vision when they make the wellbeing of the masses theircentral concern for it is not by choice but by the logic of their assumptionsthat this wellbeing of the masses is achievable only through the leadershipand commitment of the elite Which vision is more of a vision of equality depends upon the particularaspect of equality considered salient By and large the elite and the massare closer in capability and morality in the constrained vision while theyare more equally entitled to comparable shares of benefits in theunconstrained vision SUMMARY AND IMPLICATIONS The crucial difference between the constrained and the unconstrainedvisions of man is not in their perceptions of people as they are Whatfundamentally distinguishes the two visions is their respective perceptionsof human potential The average person as he exists today is not seen inoptimistic terms by those with the unconstrained vision On the contrarysome of the most sweeping dismissals of the current capabilities of ordinarypeople have come from those with the unconstrained vision from Godwinin the eighteenth century to George Bernard Shaw in the twentietheven asthey urged sweeping economic equalization Indeed one of the argumentsfor sweeping equalization of material conditions is that it will enable themasses to improve themselves in addition to enjoying life more fully Inshort the gap between the actual and the potential is greater in theunconstrained vision than in the constrained vision So too is the gapbetween the existing masses of people and those who have advanced furthertoward the intellectual and moral potentialities of man The concept of equality thus has opposite implications in the twovisions To those with the unconstrained vision a greater equalization ofmaterial conditions is imperative even if the means of accomplishing thisrequire the more morally and intellectually advanced to restrict thediscretion of others in the marketplace or through judicial activism in thelaw or by other social or political devices The concepts of compassionleadership commitment and rationality are featured prominently in theunconstrained vision To those with the constrained vision however the gap between the actualand the potential is much smaller and with it there is a correspondinglysmaller difference between the intellectual and moral elite on the one handand the ordinary person on the other Vast differences may exist withingiven areas of specializationhence Burkes reverence for authoritieswithin their respective specialties71but believers in this vision have longpointed out areas where ordinary people are greatly superior to intellectualsso that there is no such general superiority as to justify one groupsrestricting the discretion of others and acting as surrogate decisionmakersfor them To those with the constrained vision equality of discretion ismore important than equality of condition The two visions respective estimates of existing human capabilityintellectual and moral differ not so much in their estimates of the mean asin their estimates of the variance The extent to which the discretion ofsome should be substituted for the discretion of otherswhether throughinfluence or powerdepends not on the average rationality of man ingeneral but on the differential rationality of different sets of human beingsThe greater this differential the stronger the case for surrogate decisionmakers to exercise discretion for others Where this differential is thought to exist only within given areas ofspecialization individuals lacking particular expertise may remain free tochoose to purchase such expertise as they see fitfrom doctors lawyersphotographers etcbut where the differential is thought to be general andpervasive then the layman lacks the prerequisites even for choosing theamount and kind of surrogate decisionmaking needed much less to rejecttheir fundamental principles Thus a more equal world is a better worldeven if most people prefer inequality72 It is not over the degree of equality that the two visions are in conflictbut over what it is that is to be equalized In the constrained vision it isdiscretion which is to be equally and individually exercised as much aspossible under the influence of traditions and values derived from thewidely shared experience of the many rather than the special articulation ofthe few In the unconstrained vision it is the material conditions of lifewhich are to be equalized under the influence or power of those with theintellectual and moral standing to make the wellbeing of others theirspecial concern Chapter 7 Visions of Power The role of power in social decisionmaking has tended to be much greaterin the tradition of the unconstrained vision than among those with theconstrained vision That is much more of what happens in society isexplained by the deliberate exertion of powerwhether political militaryor economicwhen the world is conceived in the terms of theunconstrained vision As a result unhappy social circumstances are morereadily condemned morallybeing the result of someones exertion ofpowerand more readily seen as things which can be changedfundamentally by the exertion of power toward different goals Theconstrained vision in which systemic processes produce many results notplanned or controlled by anyone gives power a much smaller explanatoryrole thus offering fewer opportunities for moral judgments and fewerprospects for sweeping reforms to be successful in achieving their goals Conflicting visions of the role of power are involved in a wide spectrumof issues Power in the sense of direct force and violence is involved notonly in issues of war and peace but also in issues of crime and punishmentPolitical power and its efficacy are also storm centers in the conflict ofvisions The existence magnitude and effectiveness of various economicand social powers are also seen very differently by the two visions Alongwith differences as to the magnitude pervasiveness or effectiveness ofpower the two visions differ also as to the degree of inequality with whichpower is shared or concentrated mitigated or amplified by various socialconditions The role of legal rights as bulwarks against power is thereforeseen in drastically different terms by those with the constrained andunconstrained visions Moreover power is defined to mean drasticallydifferent things in the two visions FORCE AND VIOLENCE Force and violence take many forms from crime to war and including theimplicit threat of force and violence behind government The causal reasonsand moral justifications for force differ completely as between theconstrained and the unconstrained visions Reason as an alternative toforce likewise plays a different role in the two visions in everything fromchildrearing to international relations It is not a difference in valuepremises however Both visions prefer articulated reason to force at agiven level of efficacy But they differ greatly in their assessment of theefficacy of articulated reason The use of force is particularly repugnant tothose with the unconstrained vision given the effectiveness they attribute toarticulated reason As in other areas of human life the unconstrained vision seeks todiscover the special reasons for evils involving force and violencewarand crime for examplewhile the constrained vision takes these evils forgranted as inherent in human nature and seeks instead to discovercontrivances by which they can be containedthat is to discover thecauses of peace or of law and order War Given the horrors of war and the frequent outcome in which there are noreal winners those with the unconstrained vision tend to explain theexistence and recurrence of this manmade catastrophe in terms of eithermisunderstandings in an intellectual sense or of hostile or paranoidemotions raised to such a pitch as to override rationality In short warresults from a failure of understanding whether caused by lack offorethought lack of communication or emotions overriding judgmentSteps for a peaceseeking nation to take to reduce the probability of wartherefore include 1 more influence for the intellectually or morally moreadvanced portions of the population 2 better communications betweenpotential enemies 3 a muting of militant rhetoric 4 a restraint onarmament production or military alliances either of which might produceescalating countermeasures 5 a deemphasis of nationalism or patriotismand 6 negotiating outstanding differences with potential adversaries as ameans of reducing possible causes of war Those with the constrained vision see war in entirely different termsAccording to this vision wars are a perfectly rational activity from thestandpoint of those who anticipate gain to themselves their class or theirnation whether or not these anticipations are often mistaken as all humancalculations may be That their calculations disregard the agonies of othersis no surprise to those with the constrained vision of human nature Fromthis perspective the steps for a peaceseeking nation to take to reduce theprobability of war would be the direct opposite of those proposed by peoplewith the alternative vision 1 raising the cost of war to potential aggressorsby military preparedness and military alliances 2 arousal of the public toawareness of dangers in times of threat 3 promotion of patriotism andwillingness to fight as the cost of deterring attack 4 relying on youradversaries awareness of your military power more so than on verbalcommunication 5 negotiating only within the context of deterrent strengthand avoiding concessions to blackmail that would encourage furtherblackmail and 6 relying more on the good sense and fortitude of thepublic at large reflecting culturally validated experience than on moralistsand intellectuals more readily swayed by words and fashions Like other evils war was seen by those with the constrained vision asoriginating in human nature and as being contained by institutions To thosewith the unconstrained vision war was seen as being at variance withhuman nature and caused by institutions War was seen by Godwin as beinga consequence of political institutions in general1 and more specifically as aconsequence of undemocratic institutions War and conquest accordingto Godwin will never be undertaken but where the many are theinstruments of the few This localization of evil is one of the hallmarks of the unconstrainedvision There must clearly be some cause for evils but insofar as thesecauses are not so widely diffused as to be part of human nature in generalthen those in whom the evils are localized can be removed opposed orneutralized so as to produce a solution The specifics of this localizationwhether in undemocratic institutions as in Godwin or in a capitalisticeconomy as in some modern writersare less crucial than the localizationitself which makes a solution possible Evils diffused throughout thehuman race can only be dealt with by tradeoffs through artificial deviceswhich themselves produce other unfortunate side effects War as seen in the constrained vision of The Federalist Papers seemedto require virtually no explanation The Federalists considered it axiomaticthat if the thirteen recently independent American colonies did not form onenation they would inevitably and incessantly be at war with each other Tothe Federalists it was obvious that nations in general will make warwhenever they have a prospect of getting anything by it2 Far from seeingwar as an evil with localized origins in despots they argued that there werealmost as many popular as royal wars3 The idea of special causes of warwas rejected out of handIt is sometimes asked with an air of seeming triumph whatinducements could the States have if disunited to make war uponeach other It would be a full answer to this question to saypreciselythe same inducements which have at different times deluged in bloodall the nations in the world4   Within this constrained vision war did not require a specific explanationPeace required explanationand specific provisions to produce it One ofthese provisions was military power A nation despicable by its weaknessforfeits even the privilege of being neutral5 This was the direct opposite ofGodwins unconstrained vision in which a nation whose inoffensivenessand neutrality would present no military threat to cause amisunderstanding with other nations or to provoke an attack6 ToGodwin the buildup of military power and the forging of military alliancesor balanceofpower policies were likely to lead to war7 Godwin deploredthe cost of maintaining military forces which included not only economiccosts but also such social costs as submission to military discipline8 and thespread of patriotism which he characterized as highsounding nonsense9and the unmeaning rant of romance10 Within this vision the militaryman was a lesser man for his occupation11 Within the constrained vision of Adam Smith however the demands ona soldier and the weight of responsibility on him for defending his peopleelevated his profession to a nobler plane than others12 even though Smithconceded that there is a diminution of humanity when one is repeatedly ina situation where one must either kill or be killed13 This was apparently anacceptable costor tradeoff a solution being impossible Patriotism Smithsaw as both natural and beneficial as morally efficient despite hisacknowledgment of its perverse side effects14 Again it was a tradeoff thatSmith accepted with no sign of seeking a solution Crime Crime is another phenomenon seen in entirely different terms by believersin the constrained and unconstrained visions The underlying causes ofcrime have been a major preoccupation of those with an unconstrainedvision of human nature But those with the constrained vision generally donot look for any special causes of crime any more than they look forspecial causes of war For those with the constrained vision people commitcrimes because they are peoplebecause they put their own interests oregos above the interests feelings or lives of others Believers in theconstrained vision emphasize social contrivances to prevent crime orpunishment to deter it But to the believer in the unconstrained vision it ishard to understand how anyone would commit a terrible crime withoutsome special cause at work if only blindness Condorcet askedIs there any vicious habit any practice contrary to good faith anycrime whose origin and first cause cannot be traced back to thelegislation the institutions the prejudices of the country wherein thishabit this practice this crime can be observed15   Godwin likewise said It is impossible that a man would perpetrate acrime in the moment when he sees it in all its enormity16 In the twentiethcentury as well it has been said in a highly acclaimed book that healthyrational people will not injure others17 Within this vision people areforced to commit crimes by special reasons whether social or psychiatricReducing those special reasons poverty discrimination unemploymentmental illness etc is therefore the way to reduce crimeThe basic solution for most crime is economichomes healtheducation employment beauty If the law is to be enforcedandrights fulfilled for the poorwe must end poverty Until we do therewill be no equal protection of the laws To permit conditions that breedantisocial conduct to continue is our greatest crime18   In both visions the conclusions follow logically from the initialassumptions Both visions also recognize that most people are horrified atcertain crimes and would be morally incapable of committing them Theydiffer as to why this is so The constrained vision of human nature sees thisrevulsion at the thought of committing certain crimes as the product ofsocial conditioninga sense of general morality personal honor andhumane feelings all cultivated by the many traditions and institutions ofsociety The unconstrained vision sees human nature as itself averse tocrime and society as undermining this natural aversion through its owninjustices insensitivities and brutality Society drains compassion from the human spirit and breeds crime19according to a modern version of the unconstrained vision Given humannature as seen in the unconstrained vision such crimes as robbery riotsrape and mugging are inherently irrational and are explained only byirrational conditions imposed upon the unfortunate segment of society20Such evils of society as poverty unemployment and overcrowding are thefountainheads of crime21 From this perspective criminals are not so muchthe individual causes of crime as the symptoms and transmitters of a deepersocial malaiseCrime reflects more than the character of the pitiful few who commitit It reflects the character of the entire society22   In this vein the assassinations of John F Kennedy Robert Kennedy andMartin Luther King during the 1960s were regarded as reflections onAmerican society in general not just the particular assassins Those whoargued this way often reflected the unconstrained vision in a wide range ofsocial economic and political issues But in the constrained vision ofhuman nature natural incentives to commit crimes are so commonplace thatartificial counterincentives must be created and maintainednotably moraltraining and punishment Adam Smith acknowledged that the infliction ofpunishment is itself a negative experience to humane individuals but againit was a cost he was willing to paya necessary tradeoff in a situation withno solutionWhen the guilty is about to suffer that just retaliation which thenatural indignation of mankind tells them is due to his crimes whenthe insolence of his injustice is broken and humbled by the terror of hisapproaching punishment when he ceases to be an object of fear withthe generous and humane he begins to be an object of pity Thethought of what he is about to suffer extinguishes their resentment forthe sufferings of others to which he has given occasion They aredisposed to pardon and forgive him and to save him from thatpunishment which in all their cool hours they had considered as theretribution due such crimes Here therefore they have occasion to callto their assistance the consideration of the general interest of societyThey counterbalance the impulse of this weak and partial humanity bythe dictates of a humanity that is more generous and comprehensiveThey reflect that mercy to the guilty is cruelty to the innocent andoppose to the emotions of compassion which they feel for a particularperson a more enlarged compassion which they feel for mankind23   But whereas Smith saw the infliction of punishment as a painful dutybelievers in the unconstrained vision have seen it as an unnecessaryindulgence in vengeance a brutalizing throwback to the full horror ofmans inhumanity in an earlier time24 With this vision the criminal isseen as a victima miserable victim in Godwins words25first of thespecial circumstances which provoked the crime and then of people with alust for punishment The criminals misfortunes according to Godwinentitle him to something better than the supercilious and unfeelingneglect he is likely to receive26 The death penalty especially imposed onthese forlorn and deserted members of the community highlights theiniquity of civil institutions27 True the criminal inflicted harm on othersbut this was due to circumstancesthese circumstances being the onlydistinction between him and the highest members of the society28 Withinthe framework of this vision executions are simply coldbloodedmassacres that are perpetrated in the name of criminal justice29 Punishment as a tradeoff is barbaric within the framework of theunconstrained vision for there is a solution at hand rehabilitation This isin keeping with the unconstrained visions general emphasis on internaldisposition rather than external incentives Punishment Godwinconceded may change a mans behavior but it cannot improve hissentiments Punishment leaves him a slave devoted to an exclusive selfinterest and actuated by fear the meanest of the selfish passions Were hetreated properly his reformation would be almost infallible30 That is hewould revert to a natural state of being unable to harm anyone once hereally understood what he was doing This view likewise has acontemporary echo that the rehabilitated criminal will not have thecapacitycannot bring himselfto injure another or to take or destroyproperty31 This changed disposition represents a solution whereaspunishment represents only a tradeoff There would obviously be no pointin accepting a tradeoff unless ones vision of human nature wasconstrained so as to preclude a solution Rehabilitation and its prospects of success are seen very differently bythe two visions In the unconstrained vision of human nature rehabilitationis a process of returning a person to his more or less natural condition ofdecencyin principle much like fixing a broken leg which consists largelyin putting the leg in condition to heal and restore itself rather thanattempting to create a new leg from scratch In the constrained visionhowever decency is artificial rather than natural and if it has not beencreated in the malleable years of childhood it is unlikely to be created lateron In the constrained vision each new generation born is in effect aninvasion of civilization by little barbarians who must be civilized before itis too late Their prospects of growing up as decent productive peopledepends on the whole elaborate set of largely unarticulated practices whichengender moral values selfdiscipline and consideration for others Thoseindividuals on whom this process does not takewhether because itsapplication was insufficient in quantity or quality or because the individualwas especially resistantare the sources of antisocial behavior of whichcrime is only one form THE LOCUS OF DISCRETION Power lies at the end of a spectrum of causal factors which includeinfluence individual discretion and systemic interactions whose actualoutcomes were not planned or controlled by anyone The question as to howmuch of what happens in the world is caused by the exercise of power is aquestion as to the locus of discretionwhether among millions ofindividuals in groups such as the family in structured political institutionsor in military forces that ultimately may make or unmake other peoplesdecisions at gunpoint The causeandeffect question as to where currentdiscretion lies is only one aspect of the role of power The morefundamental conflict of visions is over where the locus of discretion shouldbe In the unconstrained vision where the crucial factors in promoting thegeneral good are sincerity and articulated knowledge and reason thedominant influence in society should be that of those who are best in theseregards Whether specific discretion is exercised at the individual level or inthe national or international collectivity is largely a question then as to howeffectively the sincerity knowledge and reason of those most advanced inthose regards influence the exercise of discretionary decisionmakingGodwin who considered the power of reasonin the articulated syllogisticsense of the unconstrained visionto be virtually irresistible in the longrun would diffuse discretion to the individual level confident that thesubstance of what was to be decided by the many would ultimately reflectthe wisdom and virtue of the few However those who have shared theunconstrained vision of man in general but who lacked Godwinsconviction as to how effectively the wisdom and virtue of the few wouldspontaneously pervade the decisions of the many wished to reservedecisionmaking powers in organizations more directly under the control orinfluence of those with the requisite wisdom and virtue The unconstrainedvision thus spans the political range from the anarchic individualism ofGodwin to totalitarianism Their common feature is the conviction that manas such is capable of deliberately planning and executing social decisionsfor the common good whether or not all people or most people havedeveloped this innate capability to the point of exercising it on their own The constrained vision sees no such human capability in either the eliteor the masses and so approaches the issue entirely differently It is not thesincerity knowledge or reason of individuals that is crucial but theincentives conveyed to them through systemic processes which forcesprudent tradeoffs utilization of the experience of the many rather than thearticulation of the few It is to the evolved systemic processestraditionsvalues families markets for examplethat those with the constrainedvision look for the preservation and advancement of human life The locusof discretion may also range from the individual to the political collectivityamong adherents of the constrained vision but the nature of that discretionis quite different from what it is among those with the unconstrained vision Where adherents of the constrained vision emphasize the freedom ofindividuals to make their own choicesthe theme of Milton FriedmansFree to Choose for exampleit is to be a choice within the constraintsprovided by the incentives such as prices conveyed to the individual andderived from the experiences and values of others Where adherents of theunconstrained vision emphasize the freedom of the individual it is either1 the freedom of those individuals possessing the requisite wisdom andvirtueas in John Stuart Mills On Libertyor 2 the freedom of themasses insofar as they are deemed to be under the influence of the moralintellectual exemplars Neither vision advocates that all individuals be utterly free to act withoutregard to others It is the nature of what it is that is conveyed to them byothersand by which othersthat differs In the unconstrained visionthose with special wisdom and virtue convey this wisdom and virtue toothersthrough articulation where that is deemed effective and throughcoercive power where it is not To those with the constrained vision thespecial wisdom or virtue of moralintellectual exemplars is far lessimportant than the mass experience of the generations embodied intraditional values and the current experiences and economic preferences ofthe many embodied in prices In the unconstrained vision the ordinaryindividual is to be responsive to the message of moralintellectual pioneersin the constrained vision the ordinary individual is to be responsive to otherordinary individuals whose rising and falling prices or rising and fallingsocial disapproval convey their experience more effectively than words Individualism takes on entirely different meanings within the two visionsIn the constrained vision individualism means leaving the individual free tochoose among the systemically generated opportunities rewards andpenalties deriving from other similarly free individuals without beingsubjected to articulated conclusions imposed by the power of organizedentities such as government labor unions or cartels But in theunconstrained vision individualism refers to 1 the right of ordinaryindividuals to participate in the articulated decisions of collective entitiesand 2 of those with the requisite wisdom and virtue to have someexemption from either systemic or organized social constraints Mills On Liberty was perhaps the classic statement of the second theright of the moralintellectual pioneers to be exempted from the socialpressures of mass opinion He did not believe the reversethat the massesshould be exempt from the influence of the moralintellectual elite On thecontrary many of his writings emphasized the leadership role of theintellectuals While Mill opposed social intolerance on the part of themany32 he regarded democracy as most beneficial when the sovereignMany have let themselves be guided which in their best times they alwayshave done by the counsels and influence of a more highly gifted andinstructed One or Few33 Among contemporary followers of the unconstrained visionindividualism likewise centers on exemption of moral and intellectualpioneers from social pressures or even in some cases from laws Forexample conscientious objections to military service or militant advocacyof violence in the face of perceived social injustice are among theexemptions Ronald Dworkin justifies while denying that racialsegregationists have any corresponding rights to violate civil rights laws34 All these views on both sides are consistent with their initial premises Ifman has moralintellectual capabilities far in advance of those currentlymanifested in the mass of ordinary people then the special wisdom andvirtue of those who have already gone much further in the direction of thosehuman potentialities must not only be made the basis for the decisions ofothers whether by influence or power but must itself be exempted to someextent from the social control of retrograde masses and perhaps even fromsome laws reflecting retrograde views But if the knowledge virtue andwisdom that matter most are those deriving from the experience of themasses whether expressed in traditions constitutions or pricesasclaimed in the opposing constrained visionthen the most that eachindividual can expect is to be left free to choose among the various rewardsand penalties which emerge from systemic social processes not exemptionfrom any of them The Economy The constrained vision sees market economies as responsive to systemicforcesthe interaction of innumerable individual choices and performancesrather than to deliberate power shaping the ultimate outcome to suitparticular individuals or organized decisionmakers A competitive marketas thus conceived is a very efficient system for the transmission ofaccurate information in the form of prices35 These prices not only bringinformation as to changing scarcities technological advances and shiftingconsumer preferences but also provide an incentive to react to theinformation according to Milton Friedman36 The unconstrained visionargues that this is not how the economy operates that it is currently obeyingthe power of particular interests and should therefore be made in future toobey the power of the public interest Deliberate pricesetting exists in themost basic American industries according to this view The answer is foran angry public to appeal to its political government37 Thus themarket gods are increasingly brought within control of humanely exercisedpower38 The point here is not to resolve this contradiction but rather to indicatehow completely different are the worlds envisioned by those who see therole of power differently The locus of discretion is in one case scatteredamong millions in the other concentrated in a few large corporate handsexercised by corporate managements in an impregnable positionaccording to John Kenneth Galbraith39 Each dismisses the others vision asa myth40 It is hardly surprising that the reasons why government exercises powerin the economy also differ between the two visions In the unconstrainedvision it is a matter of intentions while in the constrained vision it is amatter of incentives The governments intention to protect the publicinterest forces it to intervene in the economy to undo the harm done byprivate economic power according to the unconstrained vision But thegovernments inherent incentive to increase its own power leads it intointervention that is often both unneeded and harmful according to theconstrained vision Incentives are central to the constrained visiontheprime problem of politicians is not to serve the public good but to getelected to office and remain in power41 These different conclusions apply not only to the industrialized nations inwhich such controversies have long been prominent but also to analyses ofthe poorer less industrialized Third World Diametrically opposite viewson the causes and cures of Third World poverty reflect the same underlyingdifferences of opinion on the nature of man the role of knowledge thecapabilities of the elites and masses which characterize the conflict ofvisions in many other areas They of course disagree also on the role ofpower For convenience the late Nobel Prizewinning economist Gunnar Myrdalcan be considered as representative of the school of thought which hasregarded political power and discretion as the key to the advancement of thepoorer countries The opposite viewthe constrained visionhas longbeen exemplified by the distinguished economist from the London Schoolof Economics Lord Peter Bauer It is not merely in their conclusions but in awide variety of underlying assumptions that they differ They differ at the most fundamental level on the very question as to whatit is that is to be explained Myrdal has sought to discover thoseconditions in the Third World countries which are responsible for theirunderdevelopment42 But rather than try to explain the lesser developmentof much of the world compared to the industrialized west Bauer has insteadsought to explain the causes of prosperity and development refusing todesignate the position of the great majority of mankind as abnormal43 ToMyrdal it is poverty which needs explaining to Bauer it is prosperity To Myrdal articulated rationality is crucial to development which mustbe rationally coordinated in ways made more explicit in an overallplan44 This planning must continually reconcile competing interests anddetermine the order of precedence among them45 In short the discretionof surrogates must determine the tradeoffs But to Bauer economicperformance and political articulation are completely different qualitiesThe market system delivers the goods people want but those whomake it work cannot readily explain why it is so The socialist orcommunist system does not deliver the goods but those who operate itcan readily explain away its failure46   The relationship between the intellectualmoral leaders and the masses inthe Third World is seen in the classically different terms which have markedthe constrained and the unconstrained visions for centuries though thespecific economic problems of the Third World are a relatively recent issueMyrdal has been very concerned 1 to promote greater material equalitywithin the Third World and between Third World and industrializednations47 and 2 to enhance the influence and power of the westernizedclasses to cause the Third World masses to change their whole way of lifeand values so as to increase material advancement48 In short hisimmediate concern is for greater economic equality and simultaneously ashift in the locus of discretion to the intellectualmoral leaders thewesternized intellectuals To Myrdal without more social and economic equality mere politicaldemocracy would be an empty achievement49 His goal has been notsimple equalization of processes but equalization of results Moreoverregulations backed by compulsion50 must be used to move the masses foreconomic development cannot be achieved without much more socialdiscipline than the prevailing interpretation of democracy would permit51The resistance to change of the masses52 must be overcome Because ofhardened resistance to change throughout Third World societiesmodernism will not come about by a process of natural evolution butonly by radical state policies to engender development by stateintervention53 It is not the masses themselves but those who think andact on their behalf54 who must direct economic development In short this very modern controversy over Third World developmentelicits from Myrdal a centuriesold vision which combines economicequality and political inequality giving power to intellectualmoralsurrogate decisionmakersin short the unconstrained vision At the sametime it elicits from Bauer all the key features of another centuriesoldviewpoint the constrained vision To Bauer the Third World masses have repeatedly demonstrated theirresponsiveness to systemic economic incentives55 He rejectscondescension toward the ordinary people of the Third World56 theclassification of groups as helpless57 and the notion that they do notknow what is good for them nor even what they want58 a view whichdenies identity character personality and responsibility to them59 ToBauer the evidence refutes the suggestion that individual Africans andAsians cannot or do not take a longterm view60 He notes that proposedsacrifices are not borne by those who so warmly advocate theirimposition61 To Bauer the intellectuals so highly regarded by ProfessorMyrdal were seen as a special danger rather than a special source ofprogress for their attempts to iron out differences in culture languagestatus wealth and income and to dissolve the bonding agents of societycould only lead to an extreme concentration of power62 Their hostility tothe market and contempt for ordinary people are to him only two sidesof the same coin63 Bauer rejects Myrdals conception of man andsociety in general and in particular Myrdals practice of regarding poorerpeople as helpless victims of society64 Whether Myrdal or Bauer is more in favor of equality depends entirelyon whether equality is conceived as equality of economic results or equalityof political process Myrdal clearly believes more in equality of economicresultsand Bauer equally clearly prefers equality of social processes Inthis they are very representative of historic visions even though contendingover modern issues Their respective conceptions of power are likewise in the tradition of thetwo conflicting visions According to Myrdal power has shaped economicresults in the Third World for not only have Western nations exploited theresources and peoples in the huge backward areas of the world and keptthem politically and economically dependent65 but also domesticallyswarms of money lenders and middlemen have too many of SouthAsias peasants in their grip today66 There is economic power by theChinese minority in Malaysia67 for example Economic planning is said tohave failed when it did not lead to a lessening of the concentration ofeconomic power68 Bauer by contrast rejects the whole concept ofeconomic power in a competitive marketThe market order minimizes the power of individuals and groupsforcibly to restrict the choices of other people Forcible restriction ofthe choice of others is what coercion means Possession of wealth doesnot by itself confer such power on the rich Indeed in modern marketeconomies the rich especially the very rich usually owe theirprosperity to activities which have widened the choices of their fellowmen including those of the poor Obvious examples are the fortunesmade in mass production and mass retailing69   Note that there is not simply a disagreement between Myrdal and Baueron an empirical issue as to the magnitude or locus of power but also andmore fundamentally a different conception of what power consists of Aswith equality freedom and justice power is defined as a resultcharacteristic in the unconstrained vision Myrdal and as a processcharacteristic in the constrained vision Bauer Bauers definition ofcoercion or power as restrictions of the choices of othersa processdefinitionis one that Myrdals examples do not even attempt to meetSuch results as being economically dependent are sufficient for Myrdalspurposes as evidence of being subjected to economic power Implicitly thisis a definition of power advanced long ago by Max Weber endorsed morerecently by John Kenneth Galbraith and generally characteristic of theunconstrained visionthe possibility of imposing ones will on thebehavior of other persons70 The two definitions may seem at first to bevery similar but they are in fact quite different Whenever A can get B to do what A wishes then A has power over Baccording to the resultsoriented definition of the unconstrained vision Forexample two modern theorists say A Controls the responses of B if Asacts cause B to respond in a definite way Even when a subordinatenegotiates with another employer in order to induce his superior to granthim a raise that is Control with a capital C in these authors terminologyor power71 It is the result which defines power But if B is in a process inwhich he has at least as many options as he had before A came along thenA has not restricted Bs choices and so has no power over him by theprocess definition used by Bauer and characteristic of the constrainedvision The offer of some specific quid pro quo by A to B would be anexercise of power according to Galbraith72 but not according to Bauer forA has only enlarged Bs options rather than restricted them Even if the newoption offered by A is so superior to Bs existing options as to make Bschoice virtually a foregone conclusion a quid pro quo is still not power bythis definition Whether in a Third World context or otherwise argumentsabout the magnitude and locus of economic power are not simply disputesabout empirical facts but go back to a basic conflict of visions and aconflict of definitions derived from those different visions Because the ability to affect particular results in one way or another ismuch more widespread than the ability to shape whole social processespower is a more pervasive feature of the unconstrained vision than of theconstrained vision In modern times the concept of economic power hasbeen predominantly associated with those who on other grounds as wellare in the tradition of the unconstrained vision while those with theconstrained vision remain skeptical if not dismissive of such a conceptThe salient point here is that how much power exists in whatever contextdepends upon how power is defined More important the appropriate policyresponse to power depends upon what it is substantively that is beingresponded to not the word used to describe it73 To those with the constrained vision to deal with the problems of aneconomic process in which power is at most attenuated by increasing andconcentrating political power that is very real is to reduce rather thanincrease human freedom But to those with the unconstrained vision with adifferent conception of power the exercise of political power is pale incontrast with that exercised by concentrated and organized propertyinterests74 They use the same word but they are talking about twodifferent things overlapping just enough to be confused with one another The Law In many legal cases the most fundamental decision is who should decidein short the locus of discretion The question of narrow versus expansivejudicial interpretation of the Constitution is ultimately a question as towhether the courts should restrict themselves as much as possible todefining boundaries within which others may exercise relatively uninhibitedchoices or whether instead the courts should reserve to themselves broadpowers to review those choices with respect to their arbitrariness orreasonableness bias or good faith duress or freedom or equality orinequality of bargaining power between the parties concerned The locus ofdiscretion under the law is one of the many questions seen in radicallydifferent terms by those with the constrained vision and those with theunconstrained vision To those with the constrained vision the locus of discretion should be asmuch as possible with those individuals and organizations directlyconcerned and systemically responsible for the consequences in the senseof personally gaining or losing Once the law has drawn the boundaries oftheir discretion courts should be very reluctant to secondguess theirchoices Even if the decisions made were clearly for the purposes ofavoiding taxes for example the real questionaccording to OliverWendell Holmeswas whether they were within the legal boundaries ofindividual discretion for the very meaning of a line in the law is that youintentionally may go as close to it as you can if you do not pass it75 This principle was applied to many kinds of cases Within limitssomeone who makes a will may be a despot with his property accordingto Holmes76 Within the bounds of their discretion state legislatures maypass laws so foolish as to kill a goose that lays golden eggs Holmesdeclared Intelligent selfinterest he noted is not a constitutionalduty77 He said it by no means is true that every law is void which mayseem to the judges who pass upon it as excessive78 Nor was Holmesprepared to condemn legally someone who killed an assailant even thoughhis action may seem to have been unnecessary when considered in coldblood afterward Detached reflection cannot be demanded in the presenceof an uplifted knife he said79 In all these very disparate cases the underlying premise was that oncethe law had drawn the boundaries of discretion courts should avoid secondguessing the actual exercise of that discretion Given the assumptions of theconstrained vision the principle could hardly be otherwise It is the legalequivalent of laissezfaire in economics based essentially on the samevision of man and society To those with the unconstrained vision such holding back by courts issimply allowing injustice to flourish unnecessarily Laurence Tribe andRonald Dworkin are among the most prominent contemporary advocates ofthis view Ronald Dworkin sees a need for courts to go beyond demarcationof the boundaries within which other branches of government exercise theirown discretion According to Dworkin there must be a fusion ofconstitutional law and moral theory80again based on values found in theConstitution rather than only on explicit rules of procedure prescribed bythat document According to Ronald Dworkin courts must supply freshmoral insight when judging the acts of Congress the states and thePresident81 If someone has a moral right to an equal education then itis wrong for the state not to provide that education and courts should ruleaccordingly82 This view is skeptical of the supposed natural right to theuse of property83 and dismisses the liberty of an employer to hire workerson such terms as he wishes as not entitled to constitutional protection fromstatutory law84 To those with the unconstrained vision it is not simply a question of thelocus of discretion but also of the morality reasonableness and equality orinequality with which that discretion was exercised If third parties are ableto make such judgments as the unconstrained vision assumes those withthe power to change these decisions have little justification for their failureto do so Laurence Tribe likewise rejects the substancedenying idea of courtslimiting themselves to drawing boundaries defining acceptable procedureswithout judging the substance of what those procedures produce withinthose boundaries85 Judges should question the tradeoffs arrived at by thepolitical branches of government rather than be satisfied if due processis observed within the boundaries of legislative and executive discretion86It is not enough that explicit constitutional rules are followed implicitconstitutional values are to be discerned and applied by judges to thesubstance of decisions made by others While discerning implicit values isinherently subjective legal process cannot be emptied of substance orsubjectivity according to Tribe87 The fact that particular rulings have particular effects means for Tribethat implicit choices have been made as to the substance For exampleprotection of property rights means in effect immunizing frommajoritarian rearrangement extant distributions of wealth and economicpower88 Thus the US Supreme Court by overruling state lawsinfringing property rights reinforced the protection of existing patterns ofcapital distribution89 There is a deep bias against economicredistribution in constitutional requirements for just compensation bygovernment when private property is taken under eminent domain90 Thelaws builtin bias against redistribution of wealth is seen as a benefit toentrenched wealth91that is it is seen in terms of its individual resultsrather than in terms of the social processes facilitated by a propertyrightssystem of economic decisionmaking By contrast legal theorists who support property rights defend them onthe entirely different ground that they have an effect on the efficiency withwhich the economic system operates92 It is not the retrospectivelyobserved results for particular individuals or classes but rather theprospective incentives created throughout societythe effect of propertyrights on the penaltyreward system93that is central in the opposingvision In short Tribe does not simply reach a different conclusion butargues on an entirely different ground from those with the constrainedvision According to Tribe seemingly neutral principles of the law betray atilt decidedly in the direction of existing concentrations of wealth andinfluence94 What is needed is a more substantive conception of equalityfor equality is essential to the Constitutions protection of free speech andassociation95 As in other versions of the unconstrained vision in otherfields so in the law it is not the process but the result which definesequality According to Tribe free speech has not been available at all96Because inexpensive methods of communication such as leaflettingpicketing and soapbox orating have given way to expensive media such aselectronic broadcasting newspaper advertising and direct mail97 freedomof speech as a process does not mean freedom of speech as a result Whilethere is equality of voting there is not equality of voice98 Economic power and institutional participation are central to thisreasoning The importance of both is denied by those with the constrainedvision who see the power of a corporation as a delusion andparticipation in collective decisionmaking as often inefficient99 Onceagain the points of disagreement are not purely empirical because powerin the constrained vision means an ability to reduce someone elses optionsIt is the existence of power in this sense that is deniedWhat then is the content of the presumed power to manage and assignworkers to various tasks Exactly the same as one little consumerspower to manage and assign his grocer to various tasks The singleconsumer can assign his grocer to the task of obtaining whatever thecustomer can induce the grocer to provide at a price acceptable to bothparties That is precisely all that an employer can do to anemployee100   Because the employer cannot reduce the employees preexisting set ofoptions he does not have power over him in this conception But to thosewith the unconstrained vision power or force is not defined in these processterms In the unconstrained vision where results rather than processes arecentral if As chosen behavior changes Bs behavior then A has forced B tobehave in a particular way For example according to Tribe if thegovernment refuses to pay for abortions for indigent women then it causescoerced childbirth acting in effect to conscript women at least poorwomen as involuntary incubators thereby denying women power overboth their bodies and their futures101 This is consistent with the generallogic of defining power in terms of the ability to change someone elsesbehavior though inconsistent with the definition of power as the reductionof preexisting options In the latter sense the government would beexercising power over pregnant women if it forbade abortions but not whenit simply declined to pay for them The clash of the two concepts of power is especially sharp in legal issuesin which governmental power is put at the disposal of private parties toenforce contracts or property rights Where the terms of contracts have beenprivately and voluntarily agreed to the locus of discretion is in the privatesectorboth initially and when a breach of contract presents to theaggrieved party the option of resorting to the enforcement power of thestate Similarly when property rights are trespassed the locus of discretionis with the individual propertyowner who may choose to ignore thetrespass or to invoke state power to eject andor prosecute the trespasser In a landmark case involving state action at the behest of an aggrievedprivate party a woman handing out leaflets in a privately owned residentialdevelopment in defiance of the developments rules against it was arrestedfor trespass In the constrained vision and the judicially restrained view ofthe law based upon it the central question for the court to decide waswhether the state action requested was within the boundaries of theowners property rights But in the more judicially activist view of theopposing vision the court should inquire into whether the state actionrequested was consonant with the values emanating from theConstitution not simply whether it was consonant with the explicit ruleswritten there Among these constitutional values would be freedom ofspeech under the First Amendment which explicitly forbade governmentbut not private individualsfrom restricting communications In this particular caseMarsh v Alabama 1946the US SupremeCourt overruled the trespass conviction on grounds of freedom of speech Insubsequent cases involving similar trespass in shopping centers theSupreme Court decision sometimes went one way and sometimes theopposite way102 What is relevant here are the rationales for each positionand how they relate to the underlying conceptions of power and the locus ofdiscretion in applying it Where the states enforcement of trespass laws isprocedurally correct as an application of explicit property rights those withthe unconstrained vision have nevertheless argued that the courts shouldrefuse to countenance state action when the net result will be to denysomeone the exercise of free speech on that property or to exclude someonefrom that property because the owner does not like people of that race Likeso many issues between those with constrained and unconstrained visionsstate action cases turn on whether it is process or result that is paramount While conceding that the Constitution does not directly concern itselfwith private actors Laurence Tribe nevertheless declares that to putprivate actors in a position to inflict injury by resort to state power undertrespass laws makes the state guilty of the substantive result103 Thus stateaction can be a subterfuge for substantive choices104 But to those whoseconstrained vision limits what man should attempt to making processesoperate according to agreed principles the only question is whether thelegal boundaries of property rights were rightly drawn not what substantiveresult occurred within the bounds of the discretion permitted the ownerThere are echoes of Oliver Wendell Holmes in a latterday Supreme CourtJustices dissenting opinion that the right to use and dispose of his propertyas he sees fit means that within those boundaries the owner has the legalright to be irrational arbitrary capricious even unjust105 SUMMARY AND IMPLICATIONS The role of various forms of power is seen very differently by those withthe constrained and the unconstrained visions The amassing of militarypower by a peaceful nation is dangerously counterproductive according tothe unconstrained vision and absolutely essential to preserve peaceaccording to the constrained vision These opposing views are as commontoday as they were in the eighteenth centuryand as highly correlated withtheir proponents respective positions on unrelated domestic social issuesinvolving income and wealth differences or crime and punishment Evenissues of more recent vintage such as abortion or Third Worlddevelopment divide controversialists along lines reflecting differentunderlying assumptions that go back for centuries The constrained vision of human intellectual and moral capabilities reliesless on articulated rationality to convince and more on incentives toinfluence behavior This vision sees unprovoked aggressionwhether bycriminals or nationsas something to be systemically deterred rather thansomething that can be rooted out by better understanding conveyed to thoselacking it or by defusing emotions which might otherwise overridejudgment Neither criminals warmakers nor Third World peoples are seenas requiring or likely to derive much benefit from the articulatedrationality of the intellectually or morally advanced segments of societyNor is the law seen as benefiting from their fresh insights being substitutedfor the implicit wisdom of systemically evolved procedures By contrast the unconstrained vision necessarily sees a larger gapbetween current human capabilities and the ultimate intellectual and moralpotential of the species It is consistent with if not entailed by this visionthat the existing intellectual and moral variance between the ordinaryperson and those who have traveled further along the road toward largerhuman potentialities would be greater than in the constrained vision Thisimposes on the elites a duty to seek more influence on the course of eventswhether in law international relations or Third World development In thiscontext deference to less advanced popular beliefs or ancient institutionsand traditions would be an almost fetishistic abdication of responsibilityThis is especially so where resort to force or the threat of force is involvedProposals that they observe such deference often evokes amazement scornor even a questioning of the honesty of those who make such proposalswhich are indeed irrational given the assumptions of the unconstrainedvision But those who make such proposals are often operating underentirely different assumptions Contemporary controversies revolving around differences in the veryconception of power often go back to centuriesold differences in thevisions of man and social causation Whenever one individual or group canchange the behavior of another then the former has power over the latter aspower is conceived by J K Galbraith Gunnar Myrdal Laurence Tribe orother modern thinkers in the tradition of the unconstrained vision Thosewith the constrained vision reject this conception of power when behavioralchanges are made in response to a quid pro quo and conceive of power asthe ability to reduce someones preexisting options The result may be thesame in both cases whether achieved by threat or reward but theconstrained vision is not a vision of results but of processes If one conceives it to be within the capabilities of man to control theexercise of power and to limit it to socially desirable results as those withthe unconstrained vision do then it is arbitrary to do so only with powerdefined as the ability to reduce preexisting options But if monitoring thedesirability of myriad individual results is in general beyond the capabilitiesof any individual or council as those with the constrained vision assume itto be then efforts to produce social benefits must focus on generalprocesses and on power restrictionsmeaning restricting the ability ofsome to reduce the options of others Both visions see the abuses of power whether direct force or in othersocial forms They disagree widely and fundamentally on the means ofcontrolling it Chapter 8 Visions of Justice Adam Smith and John Rawls each made justice the prime virtue of asociety but they said it in such different senses as to mean nearly oppositethings Moreover the differences between them were not due simply totheir very different conceptions of what constituted justicea process inSmith a result in Rawlsbut more fundamentally were due to how theywanted the principle of justice applied According to RawlsJustice is the first virtue of social institutions as truth is of systems ofthought A theory however elegant and economical must be rejected orrevised if it is untrue likewise laws and institutions no matter howefficient and wellarranged must be reformed or abolished if they areunjust Each person possesses an inviolability founded on justice thateven the welfare of society as a whole cannot override For this reasonjustice    does not allow that the sacrifices imposed on a few areoutweighed by the larger sum of advantages enjoyed by many    Theonly thing that permits us to acquiesce in an erroneous theory is thelack of a better one analogously an injustice is tolerable only when itis necessary to avoid an even greater injustice Being first virtues ofhuman activities truth and justice are uncompromising1   Rawlsian justice is not to be traded off even for the existence of anotherwise wellrun society Others with a similar vision speak of rightsbased on justice as trumps which invariably prevail over other socialconsiderations2 There are different values of trumps so that one must giveway to another but all trumps prevail over all nontrumps The superiorclaims of justice have been part of the unconstrained vision as far back asWilliam Godwin3 Those with this vision may differ among themselves asto the specifics of justice as there are differences within the tradition of theconstrained vision as well and they differ especially as to the extent towhich government is the instrumentality of enforcing these moralprinciples4 But what is consistent in the unconstrained vision is that 1justice is categorically paramount and that 2 rights derived from justiceinhere in individuals and for individuals A very different view of justice is found in the constrained vision ofAdam Smith who said society cannot subsist unless the laws of justiceare tolerably observed5 Smith assertedSociety may subsist though not in the most comfortable state withoutbeneficence but the prevalence of injustice must utterly destroy it6   Justice thus derived its importance from the need to preserve societynot society its raison dtre from the need to produce justice Moreoverjustice need only be tolerably observed to serve its social function ofmaintaining order and that overriding need for social order was due to thelimitations of man According to SmithMen though naturally sympathetic feel so little for another withwhom they have no particular connection in comparison to what theyfeel for themselves the misery of one who is merely their fellowcreature is of so little importance to them in comparison even of asmall convenience of their own they have it so much in their power tohurt him and may have so many temptations to do so that if thisprinciple justice did not stand up within them and overawe them intoa respect for his innocence they would like wild beasts be at all timesready to fly upon him and a man would enter an assembly of men ashe enters a den of lions7   Here the elements of Smiths constrained vision stand out in starkcontrast to those of the unconstrained vision While man as conceived bySmith had natural sympathythat was the cornerstone of the moral codeelaborated in his Theory of Moral Sentimentsthis sympathy and mansreason serve to provide mankind with general principles for society ratherthan with direct restraints on individual behavior Where derived andrefined principles of justice serve as an individual restraint it is not becauseof sympathy and reason but because the social inculcation of justice servesto overawe the individual Because society cannot subsist among thosewho are at all times ready to hurt and injure one another8 justice isinstrumentallysocietys prime virtue The instrumental nature of justice and its consequent subordination attimes to other social imperatives is a recurring theme in the constrainedvisionand is anathema to the unconstrained vision Implicit in thissubordination of justice to order in the constrained vision is the conclusionthat man will suffer more by the breakdown of ordereven an unjust orderthan by some injustices Those with the constrained vision accept thistradeoff because the inherent limitations of man as they conceive manleave no solution to hope for In this vision of incremental tradeoffs thecategorical concept of trumps is completely inapplicable LEGAL JUSTICE The Constrained Vision Oliver Wendell Holmes illustrated the way in which the inherent limitationsof human beings were central to the concept of legal justice as seen in theconstrained visionThe law takes no account of the infinite varieties of temperamentintellect and education which make the internal character of a givenact so different in different men It does not attempt to see men as Godsees them    If for instance a man is born hasty and awkward isalways having accidents and hurting himself or his neighbors no doubthis congenital defects will be allowed for in the courts of heaven buthis slips are no less troublesome to his neighbors than if they sprangfrom guilty neglect His neighbors accordingly require him at hisproper peril to come up to their standard and the courts which theyestablish decline to take his personal equation into account9   Holmes thus established two standards of justiceand deliberately chosethe lower standard as the proper one for human beings to administer giventhe inherent limitations of man It was a conscious tradeoff of justice forthe interest of the society as a whole Holmes said justice to the individualis rightly outweighed by the larger interests on the other side of thescales10 He opposed confounding morality with law11 Law existed topreserve society Criminal justice for example was primarily concernedwith deterring crime not with finely adjusting punishments to theindividualPublic policy sacrifices the individual to the general good It isdesirable that the burden of all should be equal but it is still moredesirable to put an end to robbery and murder12   Once again Holmes rejected the higher standard of justicethedesirable tailoring of punishment to the individualin favor of the lowerstandard of justice Implicit in putting aside the solution in favor of thetradeoff was the assumption that the solution was beyond human capabilitya point already made explicitly in his discussion of civil liability wherethe courts of men were said to have to operate differently from the courts ofheaven Even when the civil law prescribed the forcible sterilization of thementally incompetent to prevent their breeding more incompetentsHolmes on the Supreme Court sustained the law in the name of the publicwelfare declaring Three generations of imbeciles are enough13 Law as Holmes conceived it was not the deliberate logical creation ofgreat minds but rather represented the evolved and codified experience ofvast numbers of peopleThe life of the law has not been logic it has been experience    Thelaw embodies the story of a nations development through manycenturies and it cannot be dealt with as if it contained only the axiomsand corollaries of a book of mathematics14   Holmes did not deny that there was logic in law or that great minds hadin fact contributed to its development nor did he fatalistically acceptwhatever law existed He in fact became famous as the great dissenter onthe Supreme Court I venerate the law he said but one may criticiseeven what one reveres15 What Holmes denied was that law hadhistorically evolved by the application of logic though there was a generallogic in its propositions arising systemically He recognized the countlessnumber of great intellects that have spent themselves in making someaddition or improvement in the lawthe greatest of which he said istrifling when compared to the mighty whole16 Here as in other areas ofthe constrained vision it is the experience of the many rather than thebrilliance of the few that is to be relied upon and historical evolution ratherthan excogitated rationality that is paramount The social benefits of known law as a framework within which the manycould make their own decisions were weighed in a similar fashion by thecelebrated English legal theorist of the eighteenth century WilliamBlackstone The tradeoff between individual justice and the social benefitsof certainty was particularly striking within the British legal traditionwhere courts of equity were institutionally distinguished from courts oflawthe former to make exceptional adjustments for the sake ofindividual justice Blackstone saidEquity thus depending essentially upon the particular circumstancesof each individual case there can be no rules and fixed precepts ofequity laid down without destroying its very essence and reducing itto positive law And on the other hand the liberty of considering allcases in an equitable light must not be indulged too far lest thereby wedestroy all law and leave the decision of every question entirely in thebreast of the judge And law without equity tho hard anddisagreeable is much more desirable for the public good than equitywithout law which would make every judge a legislator and introducemost infinite confusion as there would be almost as many rules ofaction laid down in our courts as there are differences of capacity andsentiment in the human mind17   The parallel of such reasoning with other conclusions in the tradition ofthe constrained vision was not merely coincidental Blackstones vision ofman was that his reason is corrupt and his understanding full of ignoranceand error To Blackstone the frailty the imperfection and the blindness ofhuman reason18 made it an unreliable instrument for the direct creation oflaw Reason was necessary but not sufficient When Blackstone said whatis not reason is not law he added immediatelyNot that the particular reason for every rule in law can at this distanceof time be always precisely assigned but it is sufficient that there benothing in the rule flatly contradictory to reason and then the law willpresume it to be well founded And it has been an antient observationin the laws of England that whenever a standing rule of law of whichthe reason perhaps could not be remembered or discerned hath beenwantonly broke in upon by statutes or new resolutions the wisdom ofthe rule hath in the end appeared from the inconveniences that havefollowed the innovation19   In short like Holmes and like the constrained vision in generalBlackstone found evolved systemic rationality superior to explicitlyexcogitated individual rationality Blackstone thus became the greatexpositor and advocate of the British common lawdoctrines that are notset down in any written statute or ordinance but depend merely uponimmemorial usage20 Moreover in interpreting the written law Blackstoneurged following the original intentions of those who wrote the law seekingto interpret the will of the legislator by exploring his intentions at thetime when the law was made taking his words in their usual and mostknown signification establishing their meaning from the context ifnecessary and only as a last resort when the words are dubious trying tocarry out the intent or spirit of the law21 Like Holmes later in the law or like his contemporary Burke in politicsBlackstone did not advocate an unchanging law or society Whatdistinguished his position was the mode of change and the caution aboutchangeThe doctrine of the law then is this that precedents and rules must befollowed unless flatly absurd or unjust for though their reason be notobvious at first view yet we owe such deference to former times as notto suppose they acted wholly without consideration22   Though Blackstone and Holmes were the most famous exponents of theconstrained vision in the laws of their respective countries their views werenot unique not confined to legal theorists Other exponents of theconstrained vision in other fields expressed similar views when theymentioned the law To Burke for example jurisprudence with all itsdefects redundancies and errors is the collected reason of the ages23 ToHayek the law does not owe its structure to the design of either judges orlegislators24 Adam Smith saw the sacred and necessary law ofretaliation for murder as antecedent to all reflections upon the utility ofpunishment25 and natural resentment in general as the safeguard ofjustice and the security of innocence26 With all law evolved as anexpression of the natural feelings and experiences of human beings ingeneral not the articulated rationality of intellectual or moral leadersMoreover human nature was not considered to vary fundamentally overtime Holmes assumed that the earliest barbarian    had a good many ofthe same feelings and passions as ourselves27 Here too his assumptionswere typical of the kind of equality conceived by the constrained vision The Unconstrained Vision The unconstrained vision has likewise been consistent over the centuries inreaching opposite conclusions on justice and the law Although theargument has been made that modern psychological and sociologicalthinking enables courts today to individualize punishments to the criminalrather than the crime the argument for individualizing the application oflaw to the criminal goes back at least as far as the eighteenth century andhas been as much a part of the unconstrained vision as the opposite viewhas been part of the opposite vision William Godwin condemned both the absurdity and the iniquity ofpunishment according to the general category of crimes committed Nocrimes were ever alike he said28 According to GodwinThere is no maxim more clear than this Every case is a rule to itselfNo action of any man was ever the same as any other action had everthe same degree of utility or injury It should seem to be the businessof justice to distinguish the qualities of men and not which hashitherto been the practice to confound them29   It is not real justice according to Godwin to proceed by reducing allmen to the same stature according to the crime committed Rather justicerequires contemplation of all the circumstances of each individual case30Note however that the opposite positions of Godwin and Holmes onindividualized punishment do not reflect differences in value premisesHolmes like Godwin regarded it as morally superior to individualizecriminal punishments or civil liability judgments but simply regarded thishigher morality as beyond the capability of human courts They differed inempirical assumptions rather than in value premises The emphasis on individualizing criminal justice has remained part of theunconstrained vision over the centuries John Dewey for example saidThe dawn of truly scientific criminal law will come when eachindividual case is approached with something corresponding to thecomplete clinical record which every competent physician attempts toprocure as a matter of course in dealing with his subject31   In the unconstrained vision it is not only the justice of punishment butalso its efficacy which is at issue According to Godwin punishment isinimical to the improvement of the mind because incentives of rewardand punishment are distractions from the real reasons why one kind ofbehavior is socially preferable to another32 In Godwins view moralimprovement will be forwarded in proportion as we are exposed to no otherinfluence than that of the tendency which belongs to an action by thenecessary and unalterable laws of existence Man needs to be governedby the moral arithmetic of the case realizing that the wellbeing of manyothers is more important than his own33 While the constrained vision takes peoples motives and predispositionsas given and emphasizes incentives to lead to socially desired behavior theunconstrained vision attempts to change peoples motives andpredispositions so that incentives in general are less important whether inthe economic marketplace or in the law34 The unconstrained vision seeks asolutionin Condorcets words the reconciliation the identification ofthe interests of each with the interests of all so that the path of virtue isno longer arduous35 From the standpoint of the unconstrained vision the issue is not how bestto structure incentives currently but how to rely less and less on incentivesover timeespecially the incentive of punishment Social institutionsshould aim at seeing men influenced by other and better motives Thestatesman should be careful not to add rigor to the selfish passions butinstead to gradually wean men from contemplating their own benefit asincentives in general tend to cause them to do36 Godwin wished to see menmore concerned with their duties and rights than with rewards andpunishments37 Just as the two visions see the nature and role of rewards andpunishments very differently so they see the development of law in quitedifferent terms For Condorcet progress in the law was conceived as thedeliberate work of outstanding individualsLaws are better formulated and appear less often to be the vagueproduct of circumstances and caprice they are made by learned men ifnot yet by philosophers38   Further advancement was conceived by Condorcet in similarlyrationalistic termsThe creation of a system of criminal jurisprudence would be a hugeenterprise demanding time work and a luminous intelligence in thoseundertaking it and a profound mind in the man charged withresponsibility for planning and executing it39   The unconstrained vision has continued to emphasize the deliberatecreation of law by both legislators and judges in order to produce desiredsocial results It rejects the emphasis of the constrained vision on thecharacteristics desirable in legal processes as such and especially theattempt to make the judges role essentially that of a neutral transmitter ofprocess principles created by constitutional or legislative enactmentsWhere process principles have disparate impact on different social groupsthe neutrality of the principle and the judge are deemed illusory if nothypocritical The emphasis on process has been called by Laurence Tribe thedangerous allure of proceduralism The attempt to evolve principles aimedat the general benefit of society without regard to their differential impacton subsets within society he characterized as the paralyzing seduction ofneutrality and the vision of an incrementally evolving law he described asthe morally anesthetizing imagery of the natural It was the social resultthat was crucial the hidden and sometimes notsohidden tilt of variousconstitutional doctrines toward the perpetuation of unjust hierarchies ofrace gender and class which he found offensive and the attempt todeflect judicial responsibility for crucial substantive choices which hefound questionable40 Tribes viewpoint questions all formulas as devices for concealing theconstitutional choices that we must makeand that we cannot responsiblypretend to derive by any neutral technique41 In short the issue is notprocess principles but social results not transmission of law derived fromincremental evolution in the past but deliberate choices made in the presentTribe denies that this means anything goes in judicial interpretation42 butargues that interpretation of texts is inescapably subjective so that theinterpreter has no escape from the need to make commitments ofsignificant premises of social morality43 We must make choices but renounce the equally illusory freedom tochoose however we might wish to choose For it is a Constitutionaspecific necessarily imperfect Constitutionin whose terms we areafter all choosing44  Judges thus must get into the kind of controversial substantive choicesthat the process proponents are so anxious to leave to the electorate and itsrepresentatives45 To Tribe the Constitution is inevitably substantive46so that those who interpret it must decide issues taking substantive resultsinto account In short to Tribe the written law is neither irrelevant nor alldetermining The Constitution is not simply a mirror nor is it an emptyvessel whose users may pour into it whatever they will47 As an example of the difference between processbased judicial decisionsand a more substantively based decision Tribe criticized court rulingswhich upheld the legality of applying certain physical standards toparticular job applicants regardless of sex blithely ignoring sexspecificphysical differences that make the similar treatment of men and womaninvidious discrimination48 A number of sexdifference cases demonstrateto Tribe that pervasive inequalities in the distribution of power and statusare overlooked that the evils to be extirpated are instead allowed toflourish as part of the omnipresent realities that the legal ordersimultaneously reflects and recreates with relentless rationality49 In a similar vein Ronald Dworkin called for a fusion of constitutionallaw and moral theory The Constitution itself rests on a particular moraltheory and must be understood as appealing to moral concepts rather thanlaying down particular conceptionsthat is it is to be interpreted broadlyas moral values to be applied rather than as explicit rules to follow Anycourt that undertakes the burden of applying constitutional clauses must bean activist court in the sense that it must be prepared to frame and answerquestions of political morality50 INDIVIDUAL RIGHTS Both visions believe in rights But rights as conceived in the unconstrainedvision are virtually a negation of rights as conceived in the constrainedvision Social theorists in both traditions recognize that rights are notabsolute and there are variations within both visions as to the weights givenone right over another when they conflict as well as differences in thescope accorded a particular right But the fundamental difference betweenthe two visions is in what the very concept of rights means The Constrained Vision As already noted in Chapter 7 the constrained vision thinks of legalboundaries within which private individuals and groups may make theirown decisions without being secondguessed by political or legalauthorities as to whether those decisions are wise or foolish noble or meanFrom the standpoint of the constrained vision the scope of those boundariesof immunity from public authority are the scope of peoples rights This is aprocess conception of rightsthe legal ability of people to carry on certainprocesses without regard to the desirability of the particular results asjudged by others Although these rights as zones of immunity from public authoritybelong to individuals their whole purpose is social in the constrainedvision In that vision the sacrifice of the individual for the social good has along tradition going back at least as far as Adam Smith in philosophy andeconomics and Holmes and Blackstone in American and British lawrespectively Yet it is precisely this tradition which has consistentlyemphasized the importance of individual property rights for example Thecrucial benefits of property rights have been conceived as socialaspermitting an economic process with greater efficiency51 a social processwith less strife52 and a political process with more diffused power andinfluence than that possible under centralized political control of theeconomy53 The beneficiaries of such processes are conceived to be thepopulation at large and the justification or lack of justification of propertyrights is made to rest on that basis In the same way rights of free speech are zones of immunity from publicauthority without regard to whether what is said is wise or foolish noble ormean In two of Holmes bestknown free speech opinions on the SupremeCourt he rested his conclusion in favor of free speech on social expediencynot the superior rights of the individual In Abrams v United States Holmespointed out that this social expediency derived from the inherent limitationsof mans knowledge and the crucial tradeoff this implied Persecution forthe expression of opinions would be perfectly logical he said providedyou have no doubt of your premises Holmes continuedBut when men have realized that time has upset many fighting faithsthey may come to believe even more than they believe the veryfoundation of their own conduct that the ultimate good desired is betterreached by free trade in ideasthat the best test of truth is the powerof the thought to get itself accepted in the competition of the marketand that truth is the only ground upon which their wishes safely can becarried out That at any rate is the theory of our Constitution It is anexperiment as all life is an experiment Every year if not every day wehave to wager our salvation upon some prophecy based upon imperfectknowledge54   This opinion encapsulated key features of the constrained vision 1 thetest of truth by social process rather than articulated rationality 2 inherenthuman limitationsmans imperfect knowledgeas the reason forrelying on social processes and 3 reliance on experience as the overallrationale time has upset many fighting faiths The primacy of social interests over those of the individual appeared bothin this opinion and later in Schenck v United States In Abrams whileHolmes urged eternal vigilance against the suppression of opinionsconsidered loathsome and dangerous his proviso was unless they soimminently threaten immediate interference with the lawful and pressingpurposes of the law that an immediate check is necessary to save thecountry55 This was a clear forerunner of his more famous proviso of aclear and present danger standard in Schenck In both cases the publicinterest was considered paramount with free speech being a derivative rightof the individual precisely in order to serve that public interestandtherefore subject always to annulment when it directly and unmistakablythreatened the public interest itself Finally the right of free speechwhatever its scope or limitations meant purely and simply an exemptionfrom public authority It did not imply any facilitating activity by theauthorities The Unconstrained Vision Unlike the constrained vision which sees individual rights asinstrumentalities of the social processtheir scope and limits justified bythe social processes from which they are derivedthe unconstrained visionsees rights as inhering in individuals for their own individual benefit and asfundamental recognitions of their humanity Freespeech rights or propertyrights are therefore justified or not by their relative importance to theindividuals who exercise them Given the uneven distribution of propertyand the universality of speech freedom of speech logically becomes a farmore important right than property rights in this vision Freespeech rightsare thus entitled to sweeping exemptions from interventions of publicauthority but not so property rights Dworkin dismissed the sillyproposition that true liberals must respect economic as well as intellectualliberty    56 Issues involving property rights are seen in a results context in theunconstrained vision of Dworkin and Tribe rather than a process contextWhile those with a constrained vision focus on the incentive effects of apropertyrights system on the economic process those with theunconstrained vision focus on such social results as the existing distributionof property Laws safeguarding property rights are thus viewed in theunconstrained vision of Laurence Tribe as immunizing from majoritarianrearrangement extant distributions of wealth and economic power almost asthough such patterns and distributions of capital reflected somethingdecreed and indeed sanctified by nature rather than something chosen bythe polity57 Propertyrights issues are to Tribe issues concerning theexisting distribution of capital58 Doctrines espousing property rightsrepresent a tilt against redistribution59 The rights of property andcontract supported by the framers of the US Constitution representsubstantive values Therefore Tribe finds it puzzling that anyone cansay in the face of this reality that the Constitution is or should bepredominantly concerned with process and not substance60 According toTribe seemingly neutral principles in theory turn out in practice to tiltdecidedly in the direction of existing concentrations of wealth andinfluence61 Freespeech rights have likewise been viewed by Tribe in a substantiveresults contextThe decline of traditional public forums such as parks and streets hasbeen accompanied by the rise of privately owned shopping centers askey locations for reaching the public inexpensive methods ofcommunication such as leafletting picketing and soapbox oratinghave given way to expensive media such as electronic broadcastingnewspaper advertising and direct mail62   In short speech as it now comes to us is usually anything but free63according to Tribe and free expression has not in truth been available toall64 This conception of free speech like the conception of freedom ingeneral in the unconstrained vision is clearly a results conception unlikeHolmes process conception in which all that was at issue was exemptionfrom limitation by governmental authority This cost conception of freespeech has not been limited to Laurence Tribe or other legal theorists TheUS Supreme Court in a series of cases involving the handing out ofleaflets on private property housing developments shopping malls inviolation of the owners prohibitions ruled in favor of those handing out theleaflets citing the expensiveness of alternative modes of exercising freespeech rights as a reason for overriding property rights65 Had the court notsided with those arrested under trespass laws according to Tribe it wouldhave meant that local property laws would have denied the protection ofthe First Amendment to the residents of company towns and those whowished to communicate with them66 There would have been a denial offree speech by this conception even though the content of what was saidat some other locationwould have remained exempt from governmentauthority SOCIAL JUSTICE William Godwins Enquiry Concerning Political Justice in 1793 may havebeen the first treatise on social justice The term political in its title wasused in the sense common at the time referring to organized societymuchas the contemporary expression political economy referred to theeconomics of society as distinguished from the economics of thehousehold In short Godwin wrote on social justice as that term is usedtoday Social justice as depicted by Godwin was a pervasive anddemanding duty He said our debt to our fellow men includes all theefforts we could make for their welfare and all the relief we could supply totheir necessities According to Godwin Not a talent do we possess not amoment of time not a shilling of property for which we are not responsibleat the tribunal of the public which we are not obliged to pay into thegeneral bank of common advantage67 He rejected the supposition that wehave a right as it has been phrased to do what we will with our own Hedenied its premise We have in reality nothing that is strictly speaking ourown68 However these were all moral duties not political duties such as mightbe imposed by a welfare state or a socialist government It was theimperative moral force of such heavy social duties which made itunnecessary for Godwin or Condorcet to invoke governmental power toeffect the kind of social changes today identified with the stateand forboth to support property rights and laissezfaire69 as far as governmentsrole was concerned It is not difficult however to see how the kind ofsocial analysis pursued by Godwin and Condorcet has led others to opposelaissezfaire economics and to have reservations about property rights ifnot outright opposition to the concept It was their faith in the power ofreason to eventually make moral duties effective guides to individualconduct which made it unnecessary for Godwin or Condorcet to resort togovernment as the instrument of the sweeping social changes they soughtThis also illustrates the pitfalls of mechanically translating unconstrainedand constrained visions into the political left and right since Godwin andCondorcet were more radical than many on the left who would not sharetheir reluctance to touch property rights or invoke government planning Whatever its mechanisms or details social justice has been the dominanttheme of the unconstrained vision from Godwin to Rawls Like other formsof justice it is conceived as a result rather than a process But while theimperative of social justice pervades the unconstrained vision it is virtuallynonexistent in the constrained vision Social thinkers in the tradition of theconstrained vision deal with issues of income distribution as a process andconsider its humane aspects as well as efficiency issues but there is noimplication that one income distribution result is more just than another FA Hayek is one of the few writers with a constrained vision who discussessocial justice at alland he characterizes it as absurd70 a mirage71 ahollow incantation72 a quasireligious superstition73 and a concept thatdoes not belong to the category of error but to that of nonsense74 Othercontemporaries of his in the tradition of the constrained visionMiltonFriedman and Richard Posner for exampledo not bother to discuss iteven as something to be rebutted The concept of social justice thus represents the extremes of the conflictof visionsan idea of the highest importance in one vision and beneathcontempt in the other The Unconstrained Vision Humane efforts to help the less fortunate have been part of both visionsover the centuries Adam Smith took part in such efforts both in theory andin practice75 So did John Stuart Mill76 The campaign against slavery wasalso supported by leading figures in both traditionsby Burke and Smithas well as by Godwin and Condorcet77 In the twentieth century schemes ofincome transfer to the poor have been proposed by Milton Friedman and byGeorge Bernard Shaw78 What distinguishes the unconstrained vision is not that it prescribeshumane concern for the poor but that it sees transfers of material benefits tothe less fortunate not simply as a matter of humanity but as a matter ofjustice Edward Bellamys novel Looking Backward protested not only thatthe poor were relegated to receiving crusts but that insult was added toinjury by calling the crusts charity As coinheritors of a prosperity createdlargely through the efforts of preceding generations they were entitled tomorein the name of justice Central to the concept of social justice is the notion that individuals areentitled to some share of the wealth produced by a society simply by virtueof being members of that society and irrespective of any individualcontributions made or not made to the production of that wealth Whetherthey are entitled to a full share or a smaller shareperhaps only someminimum of decencyis a question answered variously by differentsocial thinkers in this tradition but the crucial point is that everyone is seenas entitled to some share as a matter of justice not simply as a matter ofcharity According to GodwinThe doctrine of the injustice of accumulated property has been thefoundation of all religious morality Its most energetic teachers havebeen irresistibly led to assert the precise truth in this respect Theyhave taught the rich that they hold their wealth only as a trust thatthey are strictly accountable for every atom of their expenditure thatthey are merely administrators and by no means proprietors in chiefBut while religion thus inculcated on mankind the pure principles ofjustice the majority of its professors have been but too apt to treat thepractice of justice not as a debt which it ought to be considered butas an affair of spontaneous generosity and bounty The effect which is produced by this accommodating doctrine is toplace the supply of our wants in the disposal of a few enabling them tomake a show of generosity with what is not truly their own and topurchase the submission of the poor by the payment of a debt Theirsis a system of clemency and charity instead of a system of justice Itfills the rich with unreasonable pride by the spurious denominationswith which it decorates their acts and the poor with servility byleading them to regard the slender comforts they obtain not as theirincontrovertible due but as the good pleasure and grace of theiropulent neighbors79   Similar themes have remained part of the tradition of the unconstrainedvision George Bernard Shaw disdained people who plunge intoalmsgiving to relieve their sickly consciences partly because it fills thepaupers with humiliation the patrons with evil pride and both with hatredbut more fundamentally because in a country justly and providentlymanaged there could be neither excuse for it on the paupers part noroccasion for it on the patrons80 While the concept of social justice in the unconstrained vision revolvesaround issues of income distributionconceived as a statistical resultthere is also a subsidiary concern for social mobility also conceived as aresult All of these concerns are viewed in radically different terms in theconstrained vision The Constrained Vision Although F A Hayek is exceptional among leading figures in theconstrained vision in discussing social justice at all the nature of hisdiscussion may provide clues as to why so many others in this tradition donot bother to discuss it While those with the unconstrained vision definesocial justice as a result which they warmly embrace Hayek treats socialjustice as a process which he bitterly rejectsthe atrocious principleimplied that all rewards should be determined by political power81 Hayekneither challenges accepts nor denies the results characterized by others associal justice His objection is not that some alternative pattern of incomeresults is preferable but rather that the attempt to create such preconceivedresults means creating processes which can destroy a civilization82 Hayeks whole method of thinking is directly the opposite to that ofRawls When Rawls repeatedly speaks of reasons of justice why societyshould arrangesomehowone result rather than another he abstractsfrom social processes to concentrate on social goals But Hayek abstractsfrom these social justice goals to concentrate on the characteristics of theprocesses created in pursuit of these goalsand the dangers that suchprocesses are deemed to represent to freedom and general wellbeing Inshort each has assumed away the primary concern of the otherprimarynot simply as to whether freedom or justice is more important but as towhether process characteristics or goal characteristics are more important Hayek treats much of the rhetoric of social justice as a confused evasionof harsh realities inherent in the processes required to move toward suchgoals To Hayek those things commonly modified by the adjectivesocialjustice conscience democracyare by their very natureinherently social so that this adjective is meaningless by reason ofredundancy if the word is used in an honest and straightforward way It isincredibly empty of meaning according to Hayek83 so that to employ itwas either thoughtless or fraudulent84 Although Hayek found the concept of social justice to be devoid ofspecific meaning he found it fraught with insinuations which he consideredboth erroneous and dangerous Many who habitually employ the phrase donot know themselves what they mean by it85 he said but others who haveused it were not simply engaging in sloppy thinking but intellectualdishonesty86 According to Hayek the phrase social justice is not asmost people probably feel an innocent expression of good will towards theless fortunate but has become in practice a dishonest insinuation that oneought to agree to a demand of some special interest which can give no realreason for it87 The dangerous aspect in Hayeks view is that the conceptof social justice has been the Trojan Horse through which totalitarianismhas entered88Nazi Germany being just one example89 At the social policy level Hayek objected to the very notion of theactions of society or the treatment of individuals and groups by societyas anthropomorphism or personification incompatible with the concept ofsystemic social processes90 To demand justice from such a process isclearly absurd according to Hayek for the particulars of a spontaneousorder cannot be just or unjust91 because the results are not intended orforeseen and depend on a multitude of circumstances not known in theirtotality to anybody92 The hiddenand dangeroussignificance of thedemand for social justice in Hayeks view was that it implied a drasticchange in whole processes under the bland guise of a mere preference forbetter distribution According to Hayek society in the strict sense inwhich it must be distinguished from the apparatus of government isincapable of acting for a specific purpose so that the demand for socialjustice becomes a demand that the members of society should organizethemselves in a manner which makes it possible to assign particular sharesof the product of society to the different individuals or groups93 In short those who argue for social justice argue for a particular set ofresults while Hayeks objections are to the process implied by seeking theseor any other specific social results for particular individuals or groupsWhat he objected to was a desire for a comprehensive blueprint of thesocial scene as a whole94 For him personification of society as athinking collective entity capable of producing specifically desired socialresults presupposed a mastery of social details inherently beyond ourken95 It was not merely the futility of the attempt but the dangerousness of theattempt that was central to Hayeks objections In his view human freedomwas crucially dependent on rules in general and especially on rules whichcarved out domains of exemption from government power These rightsas conceived in the constrained visionprotect ascertainable domainswithin which each individual is free to act as he chooses96 and are thus thevery opposite of rights to social justice which imply expansion of thegovernmental domain to produce social results to which particularindividuals and groups are morally entitled Whether they are or are notmorally entitleda subject dealt with at great length by various writers inthe tradition of the unconstrained visionis a subject totally ignored inHayeks various writings on social justice This is logically consistent withhis view of the futility of the attempt and its dangerousness It may alsoexplain why other writers with a constrained vision do not discuss thegeneral concept of social justice at all though they deal with such specificsas income distribution or the social responsibility of business97 orinthe case of Richard Posnerwrite a whole treatise on justice98 Given theassumptions of the unconstrained vision social justice is at the heart of alldiscussions of policy or societies Given the assumptions of the constrainedvision it is hardly worth talking about just as square circles are not worthtalking about however great the desirability of such things might be if theywere possible The greatest danger of the concept of social justice according to Hayekis that it undermines and ultimately destroys the concept of a rule of law inorder to supersede merely formal justice as a process governed by ruleswith real or social justice as a set of results to be produced byexpanding the power of government to make discretionary determinationsin domains once exempt from its power While Hayek regarded someadvocates of social justice as cynically aware that they were really engagedin a concentration of power the greater danger he saw in those sincerelypromoting the concept with a zeal which unconsciously prepares the wayfor otherstotalitariansto step in after the undermining of ideologicalpolitical and legal barriers to government power makes their task easierThus he regarded Nazism as the culmination of a long evolution ofthought99 in Germany by socialists and others whose goals were vastlydifferent from those of the Nazis but who promoted the erosion of respectfor legal rules in favor of the imperatives of specific social results100 Communism has likewise been seen by Hayek as a residual beneficiaryof the way of thinking promoted by people who may have no desire to seecommunism triumph According to Hayek distributive justice isinherently irreconcilable with the rule of law101 and the ideal of agovernment of laws and not of men is all that stands between a free societyand totalitarianism He quotes a Soviet writer who declared thatcommunism means not the victory of socialist law but the victory ofsocialism over any law102 To Hayek that is what social justice as anoverriding goal ultimately means as an alternative to merely formaljustice as impersonal rules of a process SUMMARY AND IMPLICATIONS The Unconstrained Vision In the unconstrained vision where man is capable of foreseeing andcontrolling the social consequences of his decisions both the individual andsociety are causally and morally responsible for having made choiceswhose social results are what they are The nature of socially just results istherefore a central concern of this vision which has produced a number oftreatises on the principles of social justice from William Godwins EnquiryConcerning Political Justice in the eighteenth century to John RawlsTheory of Justice in the twentieth This vision demands for the lessfortunate not merely charity but justice It demands of its laws not merelyprocedural rules but just resultswith the former yielding to the latter incase of conflict Judges are not to limit themselves to the application of procedural rulesin disregard of the resulting justice or injustice according to theunconstrained vision but are to apply moral standards implicit in the lawwhich rules are essentially attempts to suggest Judges cannot pretend tothemselves or others that they are only applying prescribed proceduralrules when in fact particular legal rules produce particular social results sothat social choices have been made implicitly by judges whether theyacknowledge them or not Those with the unconstrained vision want thesechoices made explicitly based on constitutional values and norms ratherthan on narrow readings of constitutional rules on the one hand or purelyad hoc judicial preferences on the other In this vision the rights of individuals are to be taken seriously asessential recognitions of their humanity and social expediency is to yieldwhen basic human rights such as free speech or the right of the accused toconstitutional protection are at issue103 In conflicts between rights thosewhich define the human being as a subject rather than an object are to havecategorical preference over other rights such as rights to property and allrights are to trump all interests such as a general interest in social peace oreconomic efficiency Inconveniences caused by pickets or those handing outleaflets are deemed a small price to pay for the basic right to free speechand the fact that some criminals escape the law due to constitutionalprotections essential to the recognition of the basic humanity of all islikewise a price worth paying to those with the unconstrained vision Given the greater ability of individuals and social decisionmakers toforesee the consequences of their actions in the unconstrained vision thereis a correspondingly greater moral burden on them to exhibit socialresponsibility rather than simply to pursue their own individual interestswithin procedural rules In William Godwins vision especially eachindividual thus becomes in effect a surrogate decisionmaker for societyeven when making purely individual and unofficial decisionsa surrogatenot in the sense of controlling others decisions but in the sense of makinghis own available choices in such a way as to promote the general wellbeing rather than his own Thus the radical individualism of Godwinwhich is procedurally the same as that of modern libertarianism in itssweeping rejection of a government role in the economy is substantivelymuch closer to modern socialism in wanting specific social results to be thedirect object of the decisionmaking process Equality has been at the heart of the tradition of the unconstrained visionin its conception of justice as elsewhere Degrees and modifications ofequality have varied among those in this tradition but in whatever degree ormodification equality has meant equality of results Given mans ability toshape social results this has included compensatory rather than equaltreatment of some While the modern form of this approach in affirmativeaction policies is quite recent the idea of compensatory social treatmentgoes back at least as far as Condorcet in the eighteenth century104 In addition to being logically consistent with the unconstrained visionaffirmative action also illustrates the role of rights and interests in thatvision Members of the general population are deemed to have an interest inparticular jobs college admission and other benefits to whichcompensatory preferences for selected groups may apply But the membersof those selected groups have a right to be where they would have beenexcept for historical patterns of discrimination Interests therefore give wayto rights which are trumps Individuals from either the majoritypopulation or selected minorities have equal interests and suffer equallosses of those interests when denied a job college admission or otherbenefits But members of the selected minority groups are also deemed tohave suffered past stigmatizing implications of inferiority throughdiscrimination which current rejected applicants from the majoritypopulation do not suffer in reverse discrimination Since stigmas ofinferiority are seen as denials of basic humanity they violate rights asrights are conceived in the unconstrained vision while reversediscrimination can violate only interests Once again in this vision rightstake precedence over interests Moral rights in the unconstrained vision are rights to results Theirpolitical and judicial enforcement justify the extension of governmentpower to domains of interest such as those protected by property rightsThose other interests are not annihilated but are abridged to the extent madenecessary to vindicate more fundamental rights and constitutionallyprotected values This process involves judges weighing competing valuesmaking complex constitutional choices in Laurence Tribes phraserather than simply applying procedural rules The Constrained Vision Much of what the unconstrained vision sees as morally imperative to do theconstrained vision sees man as incapable of doing Because of the crucialpremise that man cannot effectively monitor the social ramifications andreverberations of his individual choiceswhether he acts for himself or inthe name of societythe constrained vision treats as moot vast ranges ofmoral principles encompassed under the heading of social justice There areno constitutional choices to make if man cannot choose social resultsanyway Even when the individuals decision has major social impact itwill seldom be the result he intended given the assumption of theconstrained vision that deliberately determining social resultsrationalistically is beyond the capabilities of man A central concern ofthose with the constrained vision is precisely that there will be major socialimpacts of a kind completely different from the intentions including thedestruction of the rule of law in the quest for an illusory social justice In the constrained vision the principles of justice are subordinated to thepossibilities of justice Oliver Wendell Holmes acknowledged that takingaccount of the inborn clumsiness of an individual who innocently inflicteddamage on others would be a higher form of justice but dismissed it as aprinciple of civil litigation beyond human capability The whole literatureon social justice issuing from those with an unconstrained vision is almosttotally ignored by those with the constrained vision Particular issues arecovered in both visions but the general principles of modern social justicetheory are neither contested nor evaluated by the leading contemporaries inthe constrained vision Even Hayek who has paid more attention to thisliterature than others of his persuasion spends virtually no time on itsgeneral principles being concerned instead with determining the likelysocial consequences of attempting to pursue such goalstheir actualrealization being implicitly deemed impossible Social processes are central to the constrained vision Individual rightsoriginate take their meaning and find their limits in the needs of socialprocesses However that does not mean that incumbent judges or politicalleaders are authorized to expand or contract these rights in ad hoc fashionaccording to their changing assessments of social needs On the contrarythese rights are domains of exemption from the judgments of political orlegal authorities The assessment of longrun social expediency is alreadyimplicit in that exemption This is symptomatic of a more general differencebetween the constrained and the unconstrained visions They differ not onlyin the locus of discretion and the mode of discretion but also in the locus ofassessment and the mode of assessment In the constrained vision man is capable of making longrun and generalassessments of social processes comparing constitutional government withalternative governments or competitive economies with politically directedeconomies for example The mode of assessment is experiential and therevealed preference of the manyespecially when they vote with theirfeetis from this perspective more persuasive than the articulation of thefew By contrast the unconstrained vision implicitly sees man as capable ofjudging more immediately and more minutely when it offers discretesolutions to numerous social problems seriatim While those with the unconstrained vision often stress the complexity ofthe social choices to be weighed by judges and other surrogate decisionmakers those with the constrained vision see such complexity as too greateven to attempt to prescribe specific social results leaving surrogatedecisionmakers with the more manageable task of applying rules whichallow the substantive tradeoffs to be made at the discretion of innumerableother individuals With ordinary social results so difficult to control in the world asconceived in the constrained vision compensatory justice is beyondconsideration The moral rationales of such policies as affirmative actionreceive little or no attention given the remoteness of any possibility of theirbeing realized What is examined instead are the incentives created by suchpolicies and their effect on social processes especially the rule of law ascontrasted with the issuance of edicts prescribing results The argumentconcerning stigma was rejected in the Bakke case not on grounds that itwas not true but on grounds that it was not part of the constitutional ruleswhich the Supreme Court was authorized to apply105 In the constrained vision with justice as with everything else the best isthe enemy of the good Chapter 9 Visions Values and Paradigms Visions differ both morally and intellectually Moreover social visionsdiffer in some respectsthough not allfrom visions which play animportant role in science A central question from a moral perspective is theextent to which different social visions reflect differences in value premisesA central concern from an intellectual perspective is the very differenthistory of visions of society and visions underlying scientific theories ofnatural phenomena It is also useful to understand whether social issuesrepresent conflicts of values of visions or of interests PARADIGMS AND EVIDENCE While visions involve assumed facts and assumed causes a vision is not aparadigm in Thomas Kuhns sense of a theoretical model of causation1 Avision is an almost instinctive sense of what things are and how they workKuhns paradigm is a much more intellectually developed entityincluding scientific law theory application and instrumentationtogether2 Visions may lead to paradigms whether in science or in politicseconomics law or other fields but visions and paradigms are differentstages in the intellectual process Whether in science or in social thoughtvisions or inspirations come first and are subsequently systematized intoparadigms which embrace specific theories and their narrowly focusedhypotheses which can be tested against evidence In these general intellectual terms visions of scientific phenomena andvisions of society proceed in parallel ways However opposing paradigmsin science do not persist for centuries as paradigms derived from theconstrained and unconstrained visions have in politics economics law andsocial thought in general The phlogiston theory and the oxidation theorydid not coexist and endure together in chemistry Scientific paradigms tendto succeed each other in history not coexist through centuries While still inthe early states of the development of science men confronting the sameparticular phenomena might describe and interpret them in differentways But these divergences according to Kuhn disappear to a veryconsiderable extent and then apparently once and for all3 No such processhas yet become general in social thought The fundamental difference between science and social theory is not atthe level of visions or even paradigms but at the point where theoriesproduce empirically testable hypotheses The uncontrollable variationswhich prevent laboratory experiments with societies prevent the decisiveconfrontations which shatter particular hypotheses reverberating backwardto shake theories and perhaps even topple paradigms and the visions theyembody Moreover the biological continuity of the human race means thatexperiments which fail cannot be begun over again from scratch as achemist throws out a batch of chemicals from a failed experiment and triesagain with a fresh batch of chemicals We can never know what Germanywould be like today if there had been no Hitler or how Western civilizationwould have developed had there been no decline and fall of the RomanEmpire In short evidence is not as decisive in social visions This is duenot only to the nature of the evidence but also to the strength ofcommitments to social values Although opposing views begin with visions they do not end thereVisions are only the raw material from which theories are constructed andspecific hypotheses deduced In principle the opposing conclusions reachedcan be checked against evidence and the conflict of visions resolved Thereare a number of reasons why this does not happen on such a scale as toproduce a decisive victory for one social vision over others thoughindividuals may find particular evidence sufficient to change their thinking Definitive evidence cannot be expected on the grand general sweep of avision A great deal of partial evidence may be accumulated on each sidebut the evidence for and against ones own vision can be weigheddifferently and being convinced is ultimately a subjective process Even inthose cases where a clear confrontation in empirical terms can be arrangedand evidence produced every lost battle on one front does not signal theend of the war much less unconditional surrender When hypothesesderiving from a particular vision are contradicted by evidence in the form inwhich they were first asserted they may nevertheless be salvageable in aless extreme or more complex form Evidence is not irrelevant however Road to Damascus conversions dooccur Even if this conversion is only on a single issue the repercussions onones general vision may lead to a domino effect on other assumptions andbeliefs Responses to evidenceincluding denial evasion and obfuscationlikewise testify to the threat that it represents At one extreme in therelationship of evidence to visions is the total subordination of evidence toconclusions based on a vision or the theories deriving from it ThoseWestern intellectuals who for years ignored evaded denied or explainedaway the growing evidence of Stalins mass murders and slave labor campsare a classic example of this phenomenon Similar cases can be found for both constrained and unconstrainedvisions While evidence on particular issues may be falsified thisphenomenon is itself true and weighty evidence for the power of visions Inmany cases there are no personal economic political or career gains to bemade by the individual that would explain the falsification It is donesimply for the sake of the vision Evidence need not be falsified in order to be evaded The veryformulation of a theory may be such as to insulate it from directconfrontation with contrary evidence In other words the theory may be sostated that nothing could possibly happen that would prove it wrong In thiscase the theory is reduced to empirical meaninglessness since all possibleoutcomes are consistent with it it predicts nothing Yet though itspecifically predicts no single concrete outcome it may insinuate much andbe enormously effective in its insinuation Malthus theory of population isa classic example of a theory of this sort based ultimately on a constrainedvision but in later years adapted by others for use as part of an agendaderiving from an unconstrained vision The population principle expounded by T R Malthus in 1798 projected agrim picture of a highly constrained world inhabited by highly constrainedman It was explicitly set forth in opposition to the ideas of WilliamGodwin and of Condorcet4 whose unconstrained visions of man wereanathema to Malthus Malthus theory began with two postulatesthat 1 food is necessaryto the existence of man and that 2 the passion between the sexes isnecessary and will remain nearly in its present state These he called lawsof our nature5in short constraints unlikely to disappear Implicit alsowas the law of diminishing returns so that an increase of population wouldnot lead to a proportionate increase in the food supply as more people grewfood6 Thus there were differential constraints on the increase of populationand on the increase of food It was logically sufficient for his purposes thatpopulation could grow faster than food though by calling the former rate ofincrease geometrical and the latter arithmetical he dramatized thedifference in a way that made the idea indelible and historic Because population is ultimately constrained by the food supply theempirical implication of the original Malthusian theory is that the observedrates of growth of the two must be similar According to Malthus thepopulation constantly bears a regular proportion to the food that the earth ismade to produce7 This is the crucial conclusion from Malthus twopostulates and it constitutes the empirical test of the truth or falsity ofMalthusian theory If in the long run the food supply grows faster than thepopulation then the average nourishment per person rises and theMalthusian theory is false Given two possible outcomes which wouldrespectively confirm or deny the Malthusian theory there would seem to belittle room for controversy after sufficient time had passed and sufficientdata had been collected Yet no such clear confrontation of evidence and theory has occurredbecause of Malthus shifting formulations under stress of critical attack Inlater years Malthus declared that higher incomes among the masses couldlead to either of two very different resultsan increase of population orimprovements in the modes of subsistence8 With both possibilities nowbeing considered consistent with the Malthusian principle there was nopossible evidence that could conceivably prove it wrongwhether it was infact right or wrong In reality as census and other data accumulated overthe years the food supplyand other elements of the general standard oflivingtended to increase faster than population Yet the Malthusianpopulation theory has survived and flourished Malthus clearly had a constrained vision To prevent the recurrence ofmisery is alas beyond the power of man9 he said and he even doubtedwhether there had ever been a permanent increase in the span of life10 Hespoke of laws inherent in the nature of man and absolutely independent ofall human regulations11 and declared The vices and moral weakness ofmankind taken in the mass are invincible12 However though Malthustheory of population was within the tradition of the constrained vision itwas not the only population theory consistent with that vision AdamSmiths theory of population was quite different in analysis andconclusion13 Moreover the Malthusian population principle has reemerged with modifications on the political left among people with anunconstrained vision In the modified version overpopulation is neither inherent nor invinciblebut simply cannot be effectively prevented by relying on the discretion ofindividuals However with political leadership which may range fromhortatory to draconian there is a solution through birth control andabortions In short ideas originating in one vision may be adapted toanother But for the Malthusian population theory to last long enough forthis to happen it first had to survive more than a century of contradictoryevidence Its success in doing so suggests that evasions and tautologicalformulations may protect a theory against evidence as effectively asoutright falsification While falsification is clearly a conscious decision evasion is notnecessarily conscious and misperceptions of what constitutes evidence stillless so Theories may persist because the difficult task of bringing them toconfrontation with evidence has simply not been performed with sufficientskill and care This may be especially so when the person testing the theoryhas a different vision of his own and reads the opposing vision in his termsrather than in its own terms This happened in a celebrated controversy ineconomics which erupted right after World War II between distinguishedeconomists of radically different schools of thoughtand voluminousevidence failed completely to resolve the issue The traditional economic theory was that artificial imposition of wagerates by government or labor unions higher than those emerging in acompetitive labor market would tend to cause employment to be less than itwould be otherwise This was a direct corollary of the more generaleconomic principle that more of anything tends to be bought at a lowerprice than at a higher price In order to test this theory a critic of this viewsent questionnaires to hundreds of employers asking how they had acted orwould act under various possible conditions involving wage rates Mostemployers did not indicate in their replies that they would react to wageincreases by firing workers The critic regarded this as disproof of theprevailing economic theory14 However the prevailing economic theory was not set forth in terms ofwhat individual employers would say but in terms of what the economy asa whole would do While this survey asked employers for their own chosenmode of adjustment the economic theory being tested dealt with theopposite phenomenonhow a competitive economy imposed modes ofadjustments on individuals For example an employer might well react to awage increase by maintaining employment and trying to pass the costincrease along to consumers in higher prices but if this price increaseresults in a decline in the sales of his product forcing him then to reduceproduction and employment the net result is the same as if he haddeliberately chosen to fire workers because of the imposed wage increase The real issue was whether externally imposed wage increases reduceemployment not whether this takes the particular form of 1 individualemployer decisions to lay off workers 2 the bankruptcy of marginalfirms 3 a reduction in the number of new firms entering the industry or4 a decline in sales and employment as cost increases are passed on to theconsumer In short the theory being tested was a systemic theory of marketadjustments while the questionnaire asked about individual intentionsamong surviving businesses The voluminous evidence collected wasirrelevant to the issue These examples are not meant to prove the already obvious point thatmistakes or shortcomings mar the use of evidence Instead they areillustrations of particular ways in which disparate and conflicting visionssurvive together despite an abundance of factual evidence which mightotherwise be expected to shift the balance decisively to one side or anotherover a long span of timesuch as the centuries during which theconstrained and the unconstrained visions have survived and flourishedtogether In the extreme case evidence may simply be falsified or it may beevaded by verbal expedients which empty the theory of empirical meaningwhile leaving it full of powerful insinuations Conversely evidence may bemade to appear to conflict with a theory merely because the specific termsof the theory are misunderstood by those collecting the evidence Butperhaps the most striking demonstration of the power of a vision occurswhen no evidence at all is either asked or offered for assertions which areconsonant with a prevailing vision A recent example of this phenomenon has been the oftrepeated assertionthat higher rates of broken homes and teenage pregnancy among blackAmericans are a legacy of slavery Only after decades of widespreadrepetition of this assertion was a comprehensive factual study donerevealing that broken homes and teenage pregnancy were far less commonamong blacks under slavery and in the generations following emancipationthan they are today15 Again the point is not that a particular conclusionwas mistaken but that a sweeping and unsupported assertion wentunchallenged for many years because it fit a particular vision The ability tosustain assertions without any evidence is another sign of the strength andpersistence of visions The process of moving from a vision as an inchoate sense of causationto a specific set of theories and corollariesa paradigm or intellectualmodel representing what is believed to happenis both intellectually andpsychically difficult The precise definition of terms the carefulconstruction of causal links and the derivation of specific hypothesesunambiguously differentiated from the hypotheses derived from alternativetheoriesall this requires not only skill but discipline and dedicated effortsTo the extent that one has become emotionally committed to or publiclyidentified with a particular theory its failure in the face of evidenceimposes psychic costs that can be painful In an attempt to reconcile theparadigm with the incoming discordant evidence an initially simpleprinciple may be modified and complicated until it resembles a RubeGoldberg contraption Ridicule of these ad hoc complications is not refutation Moreover anyparadigmbeing a model rather than realitywill necessarily not fit theevidence perfectly The scientific formula for the speed of a falling objectignores the effect of atmospheric resistance but no one considers the law ofgravity refuted because actual scientific observations show deviationsbetween the acceleration predicted by the theory and that observed as thingsfall through the air Nor are people who believe in the law of gravityaccused of denying the existence of the atmosphere Rather they do notconsider the atmosphere essential to the theory of gravity and omit it as aneedless complication except in special cases such as heliumfilledballoons which rise instead of fall In much the same way believers in an unconstrained vision do not denythat man has any limitations They simply do not treat these limitations asdecisive in theories of social phenomena whose causal elements areexplained in entirely different terms with the limitations of man playing aperipheral role much like that of the atmosphere in the theory of gravityWhat distinguishes those with the constrained vision is that the limitationsof man are at the heart of their theoriesit plays the role of gravity ratherthan that of atmospheric resistanceand many of the elements emphasizedby those with the unconstrained vision are omitted as incidentalatmospheric But both visions must omit things which exist in reality andwhich most proponents of these visions would admit exist in realityhowever much they would disagree as to the prevalence or effect of theomitted factors Given then that no vision and no paradigm derived from it can fit thefacts perfectly efforts to adjust and modify visions to accommodatediscordant evidence are not inherently mere selfdeception much lessdishonesty toward others But the gray area this provides can shelterrationalizations that do fit these descriptions Moreover resistance to theabandonment of paradigms has marked the history of science as well as thehistory of social theories There are simply fewer places to hide fromscientific evidence Nevertheless a scientific paradigm which encountersdiscordant evidence is not usually abandoned in favor of nihilisticagnosticism but is instead patched up and complicated until there is anotherparadigm to replace it Visions and paradigms exist at many levels Karl Marx and a streetcorner radical on a soapbox may have shared the same vision but at widelyvarying levels of sophistication The more sophisticated versions of anyvision are in part a tacit concession to discordant evidence which mightotherwise be fatal This general need for complexity can itself becomeobliquely a further protection against clearcut evidence refuting a socialtheory When no other reply to such evidence is possible because it soclearly contradicts what is asserted it is always possible to dismiss theevidence as simplistic because the issue must be more complex than thatIn science however a simple explanation is preferred to a more complexexplanation with no greater empirical accuracy While visions can survive and thrive on their own inner logic in defianceof empirical evidence the social dangers of such insulated dogmatism areobvious It is no less arbitrary and dogmatic to declare a priori that thetruth lies somewhere in between It may It may not On some highlyspecific issue it may lie entirely on one sideand on another issue withthe other side On still other issues it may in fact lie in between The pointhere is simply that there is no a priori way to say or to avoid the difficulttask of formulating hypotheses and testing them against evidence Nor isthis an exercise in futility Even zealots may be forced to abandon someextreme outposts of a given vision as indefensible under empirical attackwhile the contracted perimeter of the vision continues to be defendedfiercely Intellectual struggles can be wars of attrition as well as wars wonor lost in a single battle The visions of science rather than those of socialthought seem to lend themselves to single decisive confrontations The growing complexity of social theories in general reflect in part thegrowing difficulties of defending them in their purer forms Burgeoningempirical data and even more sophisticated ways of analyzing them mayfail to deliver a single fatal blow to either of the great opposing visionswhich have dominated the past two centuries But some important strategicretreats have been made on both sides Neither vision can confidentlymaintain the air of incontrovertible truth which some of its eighteenthcentury exponents exhibited It is an advancement even to admit that we aredealing with a conflict of visions VISIONS AND VALUES Both constrained and unconstrained visions are fundamentally andessentially visions of causation Only derivatively do they involve clashesof moral principles or different hierarchies of social values The muchvaunted need to make our value premises explicit is irrelevant in thiscontest Thinkers with identical moral values and social preferences mustnevertheless reach opposing conclusions if their initial senses of reality andcausationtheir visionsare different Identical twins bred to revere the same moral qualities in the same ordermust differ in their conclusions if somewhere along the way one conceivesof human attributes and social causation as described in the constrainedvision and the other conceives them as described in the unconstrainedvision Just as travelers seeking the same destination must head in oppositedirections if one believes it to be to the east and the other believes it to be tothe west so those seeking the greatest good for the greatest number orany other similarly general moral precept must favor opposite kinds ofsocieties if opposite kinds of human beings are assumed to inhabit thosesocieties leading to opposite kinds of social causation Things must workfirst before they can work to any given end and what will work depends onthe nature of the entities involved and their causal connections In this sense physical science and the analysis of social phenomena bothbegin with visions It is the ability of the physical sciences to winnow outconflicting visions by systematic experiment which marks a majordifference between the intellectual patterns in the two areas However theability of science to resolve its conflicts of visions does not mean thatscientists share the same value premises but rather that value premisesare neither necessary nor sufficient to explain conflicts of visions or theirresolution People with the same moral values readily reach differing politicalconclusions Convinced religious believers can split into opposite camps onsocial and political issues if they see worldly or Divine causation indifferent terms So too do philosophic materialists such as Hobbes andHolbach or believers in a variety of other creeds Where a particular creedimplies a particular set of social economic and political conclusionsas inMarxism for exampleit is because that creed contains a particular visionof causation not simply a particular moral premise Labeling beliefs value premises can readily become one more meansby which conclusions insulate themselves from confrontation with evidenceor logic To say that a preference for free speech rights over propertyrights is simply a value premise is to deny that it rests on particularbeliefs as to facts or causation and to make it simply an opaque preferencelike that for plums over tangerines But if in fact the preference for freespeech over property rights results from assumptions as to the magnitude oftheir respective benefits to society at large and the extent to which the lessfortunate members of society are helped or made more vulnerable by thetwo kinds of rights then it is not simply an opaque value premise With exactly the same preferences for helping the many rather than thefew and for protecting the vulnerable more so than those able to protectthemselves one would annihilate the preference for free speech overproperty rights if ones vision of social causation made property rightsextremely beneficial to people who own no property as in Hayeks visionfor example16 It is precisely the correctness or incorrectness of particularbeliefs about social causation that requires scrutinya scrutiny arbitrarilybarred by the phrase value premises Value premises are ironically asort of property right in conclusions not to be trespassed on by evidence orlogic The persistence of opposing visions in the same society contrasts withmajor changes of visions that occur in individuals The large numbers ofpeople including leading intellectuals who have both embraced Marxismand then repudiated Marxism are a striking example So too are those whoembrace or relinquish various religious or secular creeds These suggestthat while the psychic costs of changing visions may be high they are notprohibitiveespecially if the changes are gradual rather than road toDamascus conversions If conversions to and from Marxism turned on differing moral valuationsgiven to the same factual perceptions of the consequences of capitalism andcommunism it would be difficult to explain why so many conversionsoccurred in one direction during the Great Depression of the 1930s and inthe opposite direction after the NaziSoviet pact in 1939 or the Hungarianuprisings of 1956 The reordering of fundamental moral values so suddenlyand simultaneously among a large number of people throughout theWestern world hardly seems credible Such conversions are far more readily reconciled with changes in visionsthan in values What these cases in capitalist and communist countriesbrought was new massive and intrusively insistent factual informationabout each social systemnot necessarily conclusive evidence but certainlypainful facts sufficient to cause many to reconsider The heavy impact ofstartling new information may shake or shatter an individuals vision butdoes not in itself realign moral values Mass unemployment hunger thekilling of innocents the deliberate degradation of the human spirit or thecynical unleashing of war all inspire the same horror as before Whatchanges is the perception of who or what is doing it and why The thrust of organized systematic propaganda especially in totalitarianstates centers precisely on facts and causation as the pivots of beliefSimilarly in places and times where religious authorities have wieldedoppressive control of ideas people such as Copernicus and Galileo havebecome targets not because they offered alternative value systems butbecause they presented alternative visions of facts and causation Existingvalues seemed threatened only because the vision on which they had beenbased seemed threatenednot because Copernicus or Galileo werepropagandizing for alternative values Values are vitally important But the question addressed here is whetherthey precede or follow from visions The conclusion that they are morelikely to derive from visions than visions from them is not merely theconclusion of this particular analysis but is further demonstrated by theactual behavior of those with the power to control ideas throughout asociety whether those authorities be secular or religious If individuals in substantial numbers find it possible to change theirvisions whether suddenly or gradually how do sharply opposed visionspersist over the centuries in society at large Insofar as visions are 1simplified projections of reality and 2 subject to contradiction by facts allvisions must encounter facts contrary to their simplified premises Thisimplies that all visions must also develop both intellectual and psychicmeans of coping with contradiction and that any prospect of conversionmust contend with the contradictions of whatever alternative visionbeckons Therefore the instantaneous conversion of a whole society seemsvery unlikelyand once the conversion process becomes drawn outindividual mortality alone is enough to guarantee that many conversionswill never be completed and that new individuals must begin the process ofvision allegiance and doubt all over again from the beginning In the physical sciences however the preservation of decisive evidenceand the logically demonstrative methods of scientific analysis undercontrolled experimental conditions means that conversion from one visionto another can be sudden and irreversible not only for given individuals butfor future individuals as well and therefore for society as a whole No oneneeds to reenact in his own mind the timeconsuming process by which thePtolemaic vision of astronomy gave way to the visions of CopernicusGalileo or Einstein While books likewise preserve records of social political and economicevents and theories the absence of controlled experiments decisiveevidence and decisive techniques for analyzing it mean that these recordsthemselves become battlegrounds in the conflict of visions Disputes stillrage over the reasons for the rise of Hitler or the decline and fall of theRoman Empire VISIONS AND INTERESTS Believers in both the constrained and the unconstrained visions have longrecognized that special interests and special pleading are major factors indaytoday politics and that what is said in these political struggles has nonecessary connection with the truth or even with what anyone believes tobe the truth Businessmen according to Adam Smith are a class whose interests areoften to deceive and even to oppress the public so that any statementscoming from them should be long and carefully examined not only withthe most scrupulous but with the most suspicious attention17 He warnedagainst the clamorous importunity of partial interests in general18 andthe clamour and sophistry of merchants and manufacturers in particular19Of political propaganda Smith observed that those who taught it were byno means such fools as they who believed it20 Much the same views havecharacterized modern thinkers with the constrained vision such asFriedman or Hayek21 It has equally been part of the tradition of theunconstrained vision going back to Godwin and coming forward to ShawGalbraith or other twentiethcentury thinkers22 The relationship between special interests and any visionconstrained orunconstrainedmay be conceived of as a question whether there is 1 adirect corruption 2 a class bias or 3 a case of particular visions provingattractive to particular interests Direct corruption may be due to bribeseconomic selfinterest or careerism determining what is saidindependently of what is actually believed about the facts or causationAlthough such explanations are sometimes attributed to Karl Marx they aremuch closer to the theories of Charles A Beard who depicted theConstitution of the United States as shaped by special interests Marxstheory was one of class bias distorting the thinkers perception of realitywith sincerely held beliefs being opposite and antagonistic in content whenthe thinkers drew upon different class experiences The weakest of the threeassertions above is that visionshowever they originatewill be pressedinto service by whatever special interests find them useful Examining first the strongest of the specialinterest explanations ofvisions produces virtually no evidence that the leading figures in either theconstrained or unconstrained tradition stood to gain personally from theviews advocated and much evidence to the contrary The entire tradition of the unconstrained vision with its equalizationemphasis has been led by individuals who stood to lose both financiallyand in status terms by the equalization they advocated Some were ofmodest means but still almost invariably above the average of theirrespective societies and some like Condorcet or Holbach were quite richThe policies advocated by the leading exponents of the constrained visionhave likewise seldom advanced their personal interests Adam Smith whopromoted both domestic and international free trade was the son of acustoms official and engaged in no trade at all being primarily an academica profession whose practices he severely criticized23 Virtually none ofthe leading advocates of laissezfaire have been businessmen from the timeof Adam Smith to Milton Friedman or F A Hayek two centuries later24Burkes Reflections on the Revolution in France represented views that costhim the political alliances and friendships of a lifetime and though iteventually brought him royal favor this was hardly something he couldhave counted on after years of having opposed royal interests inParliament While political thinkers who were also political practitioners may createambiguities as to their motivations which may be either ideological orcareerist increasing specialization over the centuries has made the theoristpractitioner in politics almost as rare as the theoristbusinessman Leadingsocial theorists who were at the same time leading political figures weremore common in the eighteenth century when Burke and the Federalistsflourished than in later times But John Stuart Mills brief career inParliament in the nineteenth century or Joseph A Schumpeters brief careerin business in the twentieth century were oddities having little significancefor their own intellectual history much less for visions in general The less extreme claim that visions represent the bias of class position isno more readily supported by evidence The class positions of those withthe constrained vision have not been consistently higher or lower than theclass positions of those with the unconstrained vision and differences inclass position have been considerable among those with similar views oneither side Milton Friedman was far more similar in social origins to Tom Paine thanto Friedrich Hayek or James Madison While Condorcet and Holbach werearistocrats their philosophic compatriots Paine and Godwin knew what itwas to struggle to make ends meet At the individual level the classexplanation of ideas breaks down completely while the tracing ofassumptions about human nature to conclusions about social policy show aremarkable and enduring consistency The numerous other sociological explanations of ideological orientationneed not all be rejected a priori nor is it necessary to enter into theirspecifics here To explain the social composition of those holdingparticular visionswhether the explanations be correct or incorrectisonly to assert that people are not randomly distributed in their visions anymore than they are randomly distributed in sports religion or a thousandother human activities None of this denies that class bias exists or plays apotent role in political struggles The question is whether its influenceoperates by controlling those who shape social visions or in other waysThat class bias where it exists will seize upon a vision which can serve asa rationalization is scarcely denied by anyone But that has nothing to dowith either the origins or validity of the vision The very reason visions are useful to those with a special interest topromote is that it helps recruit political allies who do not share that specialinterest but who may be won over by the principles or rhetoric generatedby a social vision In short the resort to visions as a means of recruitingpolitical allies is evidence of the limited appeal of special interests as suchand the independent power of visions The relative weights of the twoforces in the short run are not the issue here However much the specialinterests may predominate as of a given time the special interests of onegeneration need not be the same as the special interests of the nextgeneration while the constrained and unconstrained visions have both beenviable for centuries SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS This final set of summaries and conclusions must summarize not only thischapter but the whole work and derive some of its implications Behind theepisodic eruptions of specific political and social controversies is a patternof beliefs about the world about man and about causation These implicitassumptions or visions repeatedly divide controversialists at all intellectuallevels on a wide spectrum of issues and across the boundaries of the lawthe economy the polity and the society as well as across internationalboundaries Though these controversies often become emotional theopposing views tend to cluster not around an emotion but around the logicof a vision Each vision tends to generate conclusions which are the logicalconsequences of its assumptions That is why there are such repeatedconflicts of visions in such a range of otherwise unrelated issues Theanalysis here is not intended to reconcile visions or determine their validitybut to understand what they are about and what role they play in politicaleconomic and social struggles The question is not what particular policy orsocial system is best but rather what is implicitly assumed in advocating onepolicy or social system over another Whatever ones vision other visions are easily misunderstoodnot onlybecause of caricatures produced by polemics but also because the verywords used equality freedom justice power mean entirelydifferent things in the context of different presuppositions It is not merelymisunderstanding but the inherent logic of each vision which leads to thesesemantic differences as well as to substantively different conclusionsacross a wide spectrum of issues Visions are inherently in conflict quiteaside from the misunderstandings hostility or intransigence generated inthe course of polemics Both constrained and unconstrained visions are ultimately concernedwith social results The unconstrained vision seeks directly to achieve thoseresults sociallythat is through collective decisions prescribing the desiredoutcomes The constrained vision considers it beyond the capability of anymanageable set of decisionmakers to marshal the requisite knowledge anddangerous to concentrate sufficient power to carry out their decisions evenif it were possible Given the unconstrained vision which permits results to be directlyprescribed its basic concepts are expressed in terms of results The degreeof freedom is thus the degree to which ones desires can be realizedwithout regard to whether the obstacles to full realization be the deliberatelyimposed restrictions of government or the lack of circumstantialprerequisites Justice is likewise a question of outcomes and the justice orinjustice of a society can therefore be determined directly by thoseoutcomes whether they be the result of conscious decisions socialattitudes or circumstances inherited from the past Power is likewisedefined by results If A can cause B to do what A wants done then A haspower over B regardless of whether As inducements to B are positiverewards or negative penalties Equality too is a result the degree ofequality or inequality being a directly observable fact All these basic terms are defined in profoundly different ways under theassumptions of the constrained vision One consequence of this is that thosewith different visions often argue past each other even when they acceptthe same rules of logic and utilize the same data for the same terms ofdiscourse signify very different things In the constrained vision where mancannot directly create social results but only social processes it is ascharacteristics of those processes that freedom justice power and equalityhave significance A social process has freedom to the extent that it refrainsfrom interfering with the choices of individualswhether or not thecircumstances of those individuals provide them with many options or fewA social process has justice to the extent that its rules are just regardless ofthe variety of outcomes resulting from the application of those rules Poweris exerted in social processes by individuals or by institutions to the extentthat someones existing set of options is reducedbut it is not an exertionof power to offer a quid pro quo that adds to his existing options Equalityas a process characteristic means application of the same rules to allwithout regard to individual antecedent conditions or subsequent resultsResults matterthey are the ultimate justification of processesbut it isonly the general effectiveness of particular processes competitive marketsconstitutional government that can be gauged by man not each individualresult in isolation The clash between the two visions is not over the actual or desirabledegree of freedom justice power or equalityor over the fact that therecan only be degrees and not absolutesbut rather over what these thingsconsist of in whatever degree they occur Moreover the relationshipbetween the two visions reflects not only logical differences but also thehistorical ascendancy of one or the other vision at a given time Becausesome of the key concepts used by both sides were first defined primarily inthe terms of the constrained vision those with the unconstrained visionhave had to distinguish their concepts as real freedom or real equalityfor example as contrasted with merely formal freedom or equalityHowever the later ascendancy of the unconstrained vision forced those withthe constrained vision into a defensive posture in which they tried toreestablish the former more limited definitions of such terms as processcharacteristics In addition to these changing asymmetric relationships between the twovisions there is an enduring asymmetric relationship based on how they seeeach other as adversaries Each must regard the other as mistaken but thereasons for the mistake are different In the unconstrained vision inwhich man can master social complexities sufficiently to apply directly thelogic and morality of the common good the presence of highly educatedand intelligent people diametrically opposed to policies aimed at thatcommon good is either an intellectual puzzle or a moral outrage or bothImplications of bad faith venality or other moral or intellectual deficiencieshave been much more common in the unconstrained visions criticisms ofthe constrained vision than vice versa In the constrained vision where the individuals capacity for direct socialdecisionmaking is quite limited it is far less surprising that those whoattempt it should failand therefore far less necessary to regard themistaken adversary as having less morality or intelligence than othersThose with the constrained vision tend to refer to their adversaries as wellmeaning but mistaken or unrealistic in their assumptions with seldom asuggestion that they are deliberately opposing the common good or are toostupid to recognize it Personality variations cut across these patterns onboth sidesBurke was less generous to adversaries than Hayek Shaw lessaccusatory than Condorcetbut the patterns themselves have persisted forcenturies Malthus said I cannot doubt the talents of such men as Godwin andCondorcet I am unwilling to doubt their candor25 But when Godwinwrote of Malthus he called him malignant26 questioned the humanity ofthe man27 said I profess myself at a loss to conceive of what earth theman was made28 and hinted that Malthus appointment as Professor atEast India College was a reward for apologetics for the privileged29 In thetwentieth century Friedrich Hayeks landmark book The Road to Serfdommade him a moral leper to many30 though in that book he was verygenerous to his adversaries whom he characterized as singlemindedidealists31 and as authors whose sincerity and disinterestedness are abovesuspicion32 Further examples could be multiplied almost without limitThe point here is that these differences reflect more than personalitydifferences and are themselves part of an enduring pattern growing out ofthe fundamental assumptions of the two visions The two visions differ not only in how they see differences betweenthemselves but also in how they see differences between ordinaryindividuals and those more intellectually or morally advanced In theunconstrained vision where the intellectual and moral potential of manvastly exceeds the levels currently observable in the general populationthere is more room for individual variation in intellectual and moralperformance than in the constrained vision where the elite and the massesare both penned within relatively narrow limits Striking moral andintellectual differences are recognized by those with the constrained visionbut are regarded as either too exceptional to form the basis of social policyor as confined to a small area out of a vast spectrum of human concernsGiven the inherent limitations of human beings the extraordinary personmorally or intellectually is extraordinary only within some very limitedarea perhaps at the cost of grave deficiencies elsewhere and may well haveblind spots which prevent him from seeing some things which are clearlyvisible to ordinary people Differences between the moralintellectual elite and the masses arecrucial especially to modern conflicts of visions over the degree ofsurrogate decisionmaking whether by politicians judges or variousagencies and commissions Both visions try to make the locus of discretioncoincide with the locus of knowledge but they conceive of knowledge insuch radically different terms as to lead to opposite conclusions as to wherediscretion should be vested To those with the unconstrained vision who see knowledge and reason asconcentrated in those who have advanced furthest toward the ultimatepotential of man surrogate decisionmakingeconomic planningjudicial activism etcis essential These surrogate decisionmakers mustattempt both to influence beforehand and to revise afterward the decisionsmade by those less accomplished in intellectual or moral terms But to thosewith the constrained vision each individuals knowledge is so grosslyinadequate compared to the knowledge mobilized systemically througheconomic markets traditional values and other social processes thatsurrogate decisionmakers in generaland nonelected judges in particularshould severely limit themselves to drawing up rules defining theboundaries of others discretion not secondguess the decisions actuallymade within those boundaries In the constrained vision the loci ofdiscretion should be as widely scattered as possible the inevitable errorsresulting being accepted as a tradeoff no solution being possible Conflicts of visions affect not only such large and enduring issues aseconomic planning versus laissezfaire or judicial activism versus judicialrestraint but also such new issues as the most effective modes of ThirdWorld development affirmative action or comparable worth In eachof these controversies the assumptions of one vision lead logically toopposite conclusions from those of the other All these issues turnultimately on whether or to what extent surrogate decisionmakers canmake better decisions than those directly transacting Even with perfectagreement on value premises as to what outcome would be idealdifferences in beliefs as to the efficacy of particular policies would putthose with different visions in sharp conflict Visions help explain ideological differences which are of course onlyone source of political differences Yet in the long run these ideologicalconflicts seem to shape the general course of political trends as much aspractical political considerations dominate daytoday events To aconsiderable extent the ideological presuppositions of the times set thelimits and the agenda which determine what is feasible realistic orimperative to practical politicians Powerful as ideology may be it is not omnipotent Inescapable and brutalfactsthe Great Depression of the 1930s the NaziSoviet pact of 1939have caused many to simultaneously embrace or abandon an ideology Evenshort of such cataclysmic events the rules of logic and evidence havehistorically led many to change ideological positions suddenly or graduallyMoveover even when an ideological bias persists the empirical or logicalwork of those with such a bias may not necessarily sufferby empirical orlogical standardshowever much the semantics used to characterize thefindings may betray the ideological leanings of the analyst33 For stillothers however ideology may totally overwhelm evidence Emotions and value judgments are importantbut derivative It is aslogical for those with the unconstrained vision to put freedom of speechabove property rights as it is for those with the constrained vision to bitterlyoppose them on this as in so many other issues While not all social theories can be neatly divided into constrained andunconstrained visions what is remarkable is how many of the leadingtheories of the past two centuries or more fall into one or the other of thesetwo categories Personal and stylistic differences as well as differences ofsubject emphasis and degree are all superimposed on this dichotomy butthe dichotomy itself still shows through nevertheless Logic is of course not the only test of a theory Empirical evidence iscrucial intellectually and yet historically social visions have shown aremarkable ability to evade suppress or explain away discordant evidenceto a degree that scientific theories cannot match Yet for individualschanges of visions have not been uncommon and catastrophic historicevents have created many road to Damascus conversions The hybridvision of fascism once touted as the wave of the future has beendevastated by the experience of World War II In short evidence is not wholly irrelevant even to visions evenhistoricallyand it is of course crucial logically Historic evasions ofevidence are a warning not a model Too often the mere fact that someoneis known to disagree widely on other issues is considered sufficient reasonnot to take him seriously on the issue at hand How can you believesomeone who has said     In short the fact that an opposing vision hasas much consistency across a range of issues as ones own is used as areason to reject it out of hand This is especially so when the reasons for thedifferences are thought to be value premises so that opponents areconceived to be working toward morally incompatible goals Emphasis on the logic of a vision in no way denies that emotional orpsychological factors or narrow selfinterest may account for the attractionof some people to particular visions The point is that neither the validitynor the consequences of a vision can be determined by examining suchfactorsthat the vision has a logic and a momentum of its own goingbeyond the emotions or intentions of its constituency at a given momentMoreover those subsequently attracted to a particular vision may be quitedifferent from those initially attracted and attracted for quite differentreasons as the consequences of the vision unfold34 While visions conflict and arouse strong emotions in the process merelywinning cannot be the ultimate goal of either the constrained or theunconstrained vision however much that goal may preoccupy practicalpoliticians The moral impulse driving each vision cannot be jettisoned forthe sake of winning without making the victory meaningless Whiledefections from one vision to another may be occasioned by empiricalevidence it is usually the relevance of that evidence for the prospects ofachieving some morally desirable goal that is decisive An analysis of the implications and dynamics of visions can clarify issueswithout reducing dedication to ones own vision even when it is understoodto be a vision rather than an incontrovertible fact an iron law or an opaquemoral imperative

Why Do Progressives Hate Gentrification  Quillettehttpsquillettecom20191125whydoprogressiveshategentrification 216Washington DC Atlanta and Boston have witnessed rapid transformations Opponents ofgentrication have ranged from residents directly aected by it to wealthy college studentsdirectly responsible for it as well as prominent Democrats such as Bernie Sanders CoryBooker and Alexandria OcasioCortezCritics of gentrication give two main reasons for their opposition 1 wealthy newcomersdrive up monthly rents thereby displacing original residents and 2 rapid change toneighborhood culture represents an injustice to original residents Both critiques aremagnied by the presumed skin color of the gentriers and the gentried who tend to bewhite and black or Hispanic respectivelyThough such critiques may seem reasonable at rst glance neither of them survive scrutinyNot only is gentrication harmless its actually benecial Indeed for reasons I will lay out itsexactly the kind of thing that progressives should supportLets begin with the charge that gentrication displaces original residents Two economistsused data from the 2000 US Census and the 20102014 American Community Survey totrack individual outcomes for all residents of gentriableor lowincome innercityneighborhoods in Americas one hundred largest metropolitan areas The largest study of itskind it divided residents of gentriable neighborhoods into two categories based oneducational attainment Their ndings refute the displacement narrative conclusivelyFirstly residents of gentriable neighborhoods move frequentlywith or withoutgentrication In all gentriable neighborhoods over 60 percent of lesseducated rentersmoved apartments over the course of a decade From that baseline rate of outmigrationneighborhoods that

whomove out of a gentrifying neighborhood are moving because of gentricationWhat happens to that less than oneinten On average that person moves to aneighborhood that is just as good as the one they le As the study authors put it we nd noevidence that movers from gentrifying neighborhoods including the most disadvantagedresidents move to observably worse neighborhoods or experience negative changes toemployment income or commuting distanceBut doesnt gentrication increase the monthly rent for residents who choose to stay It doesthe study found but only for moreeducated renters The study authors observe thatsomewhat surprisingly gentrication has no eect on reported monthly rents paid byoriginal resident lesseducated renters emphasis mine They dont know why rent increasesfor one group but not the other but they speculate that it could be because of rental marketsegmentation greater willingness to pay among moreeducated renters or sticky rentsOn the whole progressives ought to love gentrication It makes black innercityhomeowners wealthier Among lesseducated homeownerswho are majority nonwhite andcomprise over a quarter of the total population in gentriable neighborhoodsthose whoremained in gentried neighborhoods saw a 15000 increase in the value of their homes dueto gentrication Among moreeducated homeownerswho are also majority nonwhitethose who remained saw a 20000 increase in property valueWhats more gentrication breaks up concentrated poverty and reduces residentialsegregation Progressives have frequently observed that poor blacks are more likely to live inconcentrated poverty than poor whites As a result they lose out on the advantages that comewith living in a mixedincome neighborhood Gentrication helps solve this problemMoreover progressives oen observe that residential segregation remains pervasive half acentury aer the 1968 Fair Housing Act Gentrication helps solve that problem tooSHAREPrivacy  Cookies This site uses cookies By continuing

Why Do Progressives Hate Gentrification  Quillettehttpsquillettecom20191125whydoprogressiveshategentrification 416If a Democratic president were to implement a policy that substantially increased the networth of tens of thousands of black innercity residents decreased residential segregationand broke up concentrated povertyall at no cost to taxpayersthey would go down as oneof the greatest progressive presidents in recent history Yet despite the fact that its eects areidentical progressives view gentrication as at best regrettable and at worst evil Thefollowing passage from TaNehisi Coatess We Were Eight Years in Power is representativeThe question is why do so many progressives take this stance One reason might be that theyworry about the second kind of harm that accompanies gentrication the changing cultureand character of neighborhoods People dont like change and its reasonable to worry thatrapid cultural change is a kind of injusticeBut the fact that gentrication causes almost no displacement suggests that cultural changedoesnt matter much to those directly aected Compared to the speed with which people willee a neighborhood when crime rises for instance the level of urgency that accompaniesantigentrication sentiment is low The existence of highly visible exceptions such as antigentrication community activist groups hardly undermines my point A few dozenprotesters will receive news coverage creating the false perception of widespread oppositionto cultural change But you will never hear about the thousands of black innercity rentersand homeowners who dont care about or love gentricationWhether or not concerns about cultural change have merit its clear that they are not thedriving force behind progressive opposition to gentrication Indeed the main reasonprogressives oppose gentrication has less to do with the wellbeing of the gentried thanwith the race of the gentriers If you doubt this consider the following hypothetical imaginethat the gentriers instead of being white were highskilled immigrants from India Theeconomic eects of gentrication would be identical rising rents for moreeducated originalresidents rising property values for all minimal displacement and so on The cultural shockwould be dierent in kind but identical in degree instead of artisan coee shops oodingHarlem you might see for example Indian grocery storesI know that gentrication is but a more pleasing name for white supremacy is theinterest on enslavement the interest on Jim Crow the interest on redliningcompounding across the years and these new urbanites living o of that interest areall of them exulting in a crime To speak the word gentrication is to immediately lieSHAREPrivacy  Cookies This site uses cookies By continuing to use this website you

Gentrification  Quillettehttpsquillettecom20191125whydoprogressiveshategentrification 516In this scenario can you imagine college students at elite universities railing againstgentrication day in and day out Can you imagine prominent Democrats making oppositionto gentrication a pillar of their housing policy Perhaps But it is far more likely that if theskin color of the gentriers were to change as if by magic most of the outrage overgentrication would disappearWithout doubt the strain of antiwhite sentiment that runs through progressive thinking isnot identicalin kind or degreeto antiblack racism Progressives do not feel for examplethat white people are unintelligent dirty or unattractive Progressive antiwhiteness moreclosely resembles communist hatred of the bourgeoisie It is a conspiratorial bigotry thatascribes to white people a mercenary nature a high level of competence and an innate desirefor dominanceSuch antiwhite sentiment not only explains much of progressive opposition to gentricationit also explains why the New York Times ran a column arguing that we should teach blackchildren not to befriend white children it explains why the Hungton Post ran a pieceadvocating the metaphorical wounding of white people en masse and it explains why SarahJeong got hired by the Times despite authoring a series of antiwhite tweets that would havebeen careerending were they about any other raceAll of this matters for two reasons Firstly opposition to gentrication has consequencesMeasures intended to curb gentrication such as rent control and zoning laws perverselymake housing less aordable for the poor and wealthy alikeBut more importantly antiwhite sentiment does not go unnoticed outside of the progressivebubble And whatever wall of ironyallegedly

cant think of a single example of American democracy or culture returning to an older better time Thepath back is a nostalgic daydream There is only a series of paths forward for any of usWell now lately Ive been thinking that the path toward rightwing populism isnt necessarily a bad thingfor me or my family or my closest friends It may actually be a good thing I dont think it automaticallyleads to fascism although there is a risk And anyway isnt rightwing populism just a lewing dogwhistle meaning conservatives votingThe way things are going  forward and not on the path back  political tribalism just might be the savingof meI do think its in my best interest that the Democratic Party not survive in its current state I would verymuch like to see the party splinter into two or more separate parties politically weakening all progressivesand doing real harm to the Socialist ProjectFrom my perspective this would be the better outcome ThersitesFor decades there has been voiced opposition to a process of urban renewal that results in pricing poorresidents out of the rental market That many on the le now condone antiwhite racism and incorporate itThe path back to

motivation on this or anyother issue That said the title did not strike as hyperbole Why Do Progressives Hate  there has been somuch overwrought emotion brought to almost every issue these days It would be useful if it could all bedialed back but unfortunately in the present issues sweepstakes everything takes on the trappings of acrusade and the advocates with the highest level of hysteria win the media attention It fosters a grievanceindustry that feeds o our baser instinctsWhen debating increasing costs of living it is advantageous to know the specics for the community inquestion For example simply reducing crime can have a long term upward eect on housing prices Is thereason for the uptick in housing due to some nefarious developer or the positive collective action of thelocal residents What ever the reasons dont look to the ideology of those who run California for solutionsTheir state is suering simultaneously from both urban blight and increasingly high housing costs thattorment the poor and are driving out the middle class Hopefully the majority outside of the aloof class willsoon understand their representatives do not represent them IkeI absolutely love gentrication As a contractor it means home improvements retail and commercial spacebuildouts and the chance to do interesting restoration work on old and historic residences and buildingsI dont know how you can argue that gentrication is economically a detriment or even lateral based on thevolume of jobs created aloneFor the record I think Coates is a shameless race hustler half a step up from the likes of al sharpton but Idstill love to work on his 21 million dollar home in Brooklyn Shoot him my info if hes thinking aboutrenovations jdfree49The gentrication conversation reveals the dishonesty of the Les talk about diversity and toleranceThe Le wants white people displaced by nonwhite people It wants neighborhoods where white cultureexists to be replaced with nonwhite culture It doesnt want any white person to be able to go back to wherehe grew up and experience the community he grew up in if that community is white It wants to stigmatizeeven the slightest nostalgia for a white communityBut swap white with any nonwhite ethnicity and the Les position swaps with it A culturallyhomogeneous nonwhite neighborhood must not be tainted by awful whiteness Its a tragedy if

dilapidation costsmoney and results in the community becoming expensive Those are the choices stay dilapidated orbecome expensive The Le will complain either way because complaining is what Leists doFixing dilapidation is the preferred option every time because resources should be put to their highest andbest use Society is overall better o and greener when the people who have the highpaying inner cityjobs live near their workplaces Lowpaying jobs are relatively fungible Yes some lowskilled people willhave to commute to the downtown area to perform its service jobs but they have the

antiwhite racism on behalf of many black neighbors Blacks coming from deeper in Brooklyn block the subwaydoors reducing the eciency of trains leaving the aisle in the center of the car vacant Should you try toexcuse me your way to that empty space its very likely youll get threatened along the way Its enough tomake a pure white person racistWe didnt move to this neighborhood because we wanted to get down with our black neighbors We movedhere because we had to The neighborhood we came from  white  Williamsburg  we got pushed fromdue to gentrication on steroids Should we move from BedStuy well end up in East New York and ondeeper into Brooklyn as gentrication radiates outward That is unless circumstances decree that we canaord to move to a neighborhood where we belongIn other words gentrication is not something the new tenant is trying to do The gentrier is a cog in awheel However I have on several occasions heard that my presence in BedStuy is GENOCIDE This wordis misused without a shred of selfawareness At a meeting recently that was supposed toheal victims ofsome racist Halloween decorations most of the attendees were white and thus told that we are wreakinggenocide on this historically black neighborhood and we are all inherently racist and dont ask thefacilitator of this bon homie how we can help  subtext  get the hell out of BedStuy we dont want whitepeople hereHowever the brownstones in the neighborhood are owned primarily by blacks Who then sell the houses tothe highest bidders  whites A house worth a few hundred thousand years ago is now worth over a

theowners do not give a rats ass about skin color Its a lovely racial rainbow here Aer renovating the rentwent up to market and has to remain relatively xed due to the number of units So our rent

on your bills that apartment is goingto go to someone who IS timely on their bills If theres anything racist about thiswellHouses and buildings are also sold to developers who are obligated to include a certain number of low rentunits unless they nd their way around thatIn any case I read such illuminating racist commentary on the BedStuy Facebook page The neighborhoodis safer and the housing stock more valuable I dont like it because I cant aord it But anyone whos ownedhere will make a mintand the only way to retain a certain skin color here is to discriminate against whiteswanting to buy inAnd

people they perform a sort of cognitive dissonance trick what they really mean iseveryone but upper classintelligentsia white people aka yover countryProgressives exclude themselves from their condemnations This is how it ties into what the author refers toas the communist hatred of the bourgeoisie They use white to stand in for class as well as raceethnicityThis is why they never oer to step down from their lucrative or powerful positions and let a poor Brown orBlack person take their place The idea is that its the lower orders that have to step aside not they Theyfully intend to stay in power and indeed the whole exercise is an exercise in power dynamics whereinunder the veil of righteousness they grab power any way they can using Black people as tools and symbolsof their own Woke Priestly Power This is also why theyre against gentrication They dont live there Itcosts them nothing Who is likely to live in newly gentried areas Why the lower orders Including  as inthe urban area I work in  working class new immigrants Indian Arab and AsianTheir races arent the rightones as Hughes points out so no one calls it gentrication But the other issue is the progressives areutterly unaware of the gentrication because its not an area they go to its too low class for them andlled with crime and violence they want to pretend doesnt existS H A R EPrivacy  Cookies This

oriented historian a thinker Why grapple with a body of thought that is difficult often elusive Why forsake the pleasures of sport the company of fri ends a nove l or a videogame for the slow patient activity of coming to understand a set of texts that far from inviting one in seem often designed to keep one at bay These are nor id le questions One might be told in response to them that the rigours of thought are good for the mind that grappling with difficu lt concepts is bracing or strengthening or a sign of good character These are it seems rome bad answers Nor that a person should nor have a good mind or a good character But why study philosophy in order to ach ieve these Would mathematics or physics or the law nor do just as well There is nothing less rigorous about these disciplines than there is about ph ilosophy They offer challenges to the mind and in addition training in something that might come in handy down the road If one is to study a philosophical figure if one is to paraphrase James Joyce to forge ones own soul in the smithy of the ir mind there must be a better reason on offer than simply being told that conceptual difficu lty is good for you There must be something about rhe thinkers being philosophical or in the case of Michel Foucault at least philosophically oriented that is itself compell ing T hat reason need nor be practical in the trad itional sense of the term It need nor lead ro a job or a social position or recognition by a broader public Ideology asid e there is no reason to believe that these are all that people seek T he reason one might study a ph ilosopher can be less goaloriented or more subtle Bur given the alternative ways of spending ones rime the reason ought to be a good one The ph ilosopher Gilles Deleuze te lls us that a ph ilosophical theory is an elaborately developed question and nothing else by itself and in itself it is nor the reso lution ro a 1 THE PHilOSOPHY O f FOUCAULT problem bm the elaboration to the very end of the necessary implications of a formulated quest ion 1r shows us what things are or what things should be on the assumption rhal the question is good and rigorous 1 Deleuze suggests that a ph ilosophical theory is nor to be defined by the answer it gives bur by the question it asks T he poinr of reading philosophy ro him is nor one of seeking solurions bur of elaborating the impl ications of a question  We must be clear here Deleuze is nor argu ing that philosophy is about questions rather than abom answers Or at least he is nor arguing it in any simple way He is nor saying only that it is the questions that marrer rather than the answers There is something em pry after all in being rold that if one asks the right question then what comes after does nor marrer Vhar wou ld the poinr o f asking a question be if the response did nor somehow marrer When he talks abour rhe elaboration of rhe necessary implications of a formu lated question he is talking nor only abour questions bur also abour responses T hose responses those elaborations however need nor be as straigh tforward as answers ro traditional questions T hey need nor be as narrow as answers to questions such as Where do you live or What is the GNP of Sierra Leone They can be difficu lt or shifting or openended If they are robe worthwhile however they need to respond to a quest ion thar is good and rigorous And that is where the riches of philosophy lie T he poinr of reading phi losophers is to follow their elaboration of the implications of a good and rigorous question  If the question is worthwhile if it is a matter of what Deleuze elsewhere calls  the lnreresting Remarkable or lmporranr then there is a reason to engage in studying it  If we are to ask ourselves whether a ph ilosophical work or a body of phi losophical thought is worth pausing over then we must sooner or later know the question that is being elaborated For Foucault there is rhroughom the body of lis work a single quest ion that receives elaboration It is the question Who are we This is not the only question he elaborates Yet it is the one he asks most doggedly the one that is never far from the surface of any of his works In his hands the question of who we are becomes a rigorous one elaborated if not to the very end then very far along the way The question of who we are or at least that of who each among us is will be foreign to no one Who has not at least once or twice asked this question And when asked seriously rigorously its answer  or its response  is not obvious There are of course many insriturions in our society that seem to provide easy answers Our churches tel l us you are a ch ild of God Our pol iticians tell us you are an American or an Australian or an Indian 2 INTRODUCTION  WHO ARE WE or   Our televisions tell us you are a consumer We are told who we are and as a resu lt we rarely ask Bm if we do nor aslk often we do ask somerimes at momems when the obvious answers seem ro fa ll away in the wake of a tragedy or when boredom overcomes us and the easy answers lose their grip or more rarely when a philosopher purs rhe question ro us in a nev way There are many ways ro ask the question of who I am or of who we are Foucault mrns rhe question reformulares ir asks it in a new way To understand how he does so ro grasp the particular rigour he brings ro the quest ion we must comrasr ir with other more trad itional ways of asking and elaborari ng We could do worse than ro starr with Rene Descartes Although he is concerned more with the question of what we could know than of who we are his legacy is perhaps greater in regard ro rhe second question The response he gives ro the question of who we are is srlill with us it srill defines rhe framework wirhin which most of us ask rhe question The legacy of Descartes one of rhe legacies Foucaulr will seek to undermine  remains our inheritance How then does he answer rhe question of who we are For Descarres rhe cemral quesrion is one of whar we could know And the problem is rhar he wams robe able ro give our knowledge a more solid foundarion than merely a reliance on fairh He himself probably pms rhe issue besr ar rhe beginning of his Meditations in an iron ic passage rhar at once challenges and denies rhar he is challenging rhe church amhoriries lr is absolurely rrue borh rhar we musr believe rhar rhere is a God because ir is so raughr in rhe Holy Scripmres and on rhe orher hand rhar we musr believe rhe Holy Scripmres because rhey come from God   Nevertheless we could hardly offer rhis argumem ro rhose wirhour fairh for rhey mighr suppose rhar we were commining rhe fallacy rhar logicians call circular reasoning3 Suppose indeed Descartes learns from rhe churchs censure of Galileo ro be circumspect in his deviarions from church orthodoxy The foundarion he offers is well known lr occurs in rwo sreps firsr a proof of rhe exisrence of God and secondly a proof rhar God cannot be a deceiver lr is in rhe first srep rhar he begins ro answer rhe question of who we are The firsr move in rhe firsr step is ro doubr everyrhing rhar he can nor be absolurely cerrain of Whar remains after such doubr Only rhe exisrence of a doubrer of a subsrance rhar rhinks perceives imagines ere Thar as ir wi ll mrn om is one of rhe rwo subsrances rhar comprise a human being The orher substance is physical marrer There is a rhird subsrance in rhe universe as well rhar of rhe divine Bm ir is menral subsrance rhar is rhe 3 THE PHilOSOPHY O f FOUCAULT key T hat is what allows him ro construct his proof of God and what seems most imporranr abour who we are T he other substance  physical matterdoes nor make its appearance unri l rhe sixth and last of his meditat ions There the existence of physica l matter in general and Descartess own body in particular is a conclusion he arrives a r on the basis of earlier proofs namely if God exists and is nor a deceiver then so much of what I experience as corporeal matter must be corre lated with my actual ly having a body I also recognize in myself some other facu lties such as rhe power of changing location of assuming various postures and other similar ones which cannot be conceived withour some substance in which they inhere 4 So who are we We are beings made up of two substances a mental substance and a physical substance T hese substances are inrimately related Indeed Descartes thinks they actually meet ar a particular po inr rhe pineal gland5 Bur rhe fact that rhey meet does nor mean that rhey are the same kind of substance He writes of rhe bodys characteristics rhar if ir is true that they exist they must inhere in some corporeal or ex tended substance and not in an inrelligenr substance since their clear and distinct concept does actua lly involve some sort of extension bur no sort of intelligence wharsoever6 Of these two substances it is rhe mind that is tlhe most important in several respects Fi rst rhe body cannot be conceived without it Second ir is rhe seat of our highest capacities those of thinking judging and free choice Final ly iris rhe mind rhe menral substance rhar gives rhe body rhe particular animation ir has lr is nor rhat rhe body would not have any ani marion without rhe mind Descartes argues rhar rhe bodly could ar least in principle operate on its own The human body he tells us may be considered as a machine so bui lt and composed of bones nerves muscles veins blood and skin rhar even if there were no mind in ir it would not cease ro move in all rhe ways rhat ir does ar present when it is nor moved under the direction of the will nor consequenrly wi rh rhe aid of the mind bur only by rhe condition of its organs7 But ro do rhe particular things rhar a particular body does in the way that ir does them requires a mind to be attached ro ir This way of thinking of ourselves remains with us 1r has been passed down ro us through our JudeoChrisrian legacy which in many ways both influenced and then followed Descartes T he main stream of this t rad ition 4 INTRODUCTION  WHO ARE WE holds the body to be a substance characterized by fau lt or sin or weakness and the mind robe a substance capable if ir so chooses of departing from that corporeal inheritance Think of such phrases as mind over matter or you can do anything you pur your mind ro or  its all in your mind These cliches and so many like them reveal a particular cultural inheritance committed ro rwo ideas First there is an important separation between mind and body a separation that Descartes characterizes by say ing rhar they are different substances Secondly in this separation the mental is privi leged with respect to the physical Many current scientists wou ld dispute Descartess claim that there is a mental substance distinct from the physical one They believe that what is called mental substance is nothing more than the working of the brain or more broadly of the body Foucaults writings by the way are nor contrary to such a viewpoint However the weight of tradition lies heavily on most of us and it remains difficult to think of ourselves otherwise than as beings rhar are defined as a particular combination of mind and body Even when we seek to escape this inheritance it finds it way back through our speech and into our conception of ourselves Foucault is cognizant of this and uses ir as we shall see in derai l later ro invert our JudeoChrisrian legacy when he declares in his book on the prisons that the soul is the prison of the body DP 30 If we set Descartes aside for a moment to turn to a more nearly contemporary thinker we shall see beyond surface differences important similarities rhar run through the philosophical tradition At first ir may be hard ro imagine a thinker more different from Descartes than Sigmund Freud Whereas Descartes privi leges consciousness Freud privileges the unconscious Where Descartes sees a large measure of free will Freud sees a long and often unsuccessful struggle to attain any freedom Where Descartes allows reason to rid us of the burden of false conceptions Freud sees us as being burdened by a history whose legacy one can never entire ly escape So who are we in Freuds view This is a difficult question to answer and nor only because his writings can be elusive Feud seems to present us with rwo distinct topographies of the mind one that dominates his earl ier writings and another that appears later on The first one in which the dist inction between the conscious and the unconscious dominates wi ll be our focus The second one with irs tripartite division into id ego and superego can be interpreted in ligh t of the earl ier one and we shall leave it aside To think of human beings as having an unconscious and furthermore to think of who they are as being largely a matter of what happens in that unconscious and how it expresses itself is a revolutionary idea at the rime of Freuds wri tings in the early twentieth century He thinks of the idea as the third great blow to humanitys view of itself as a privileged being in the 5 THE PHilOSOPHY O f FOUCAULT universe after Copernicuss d iscovery that the earth revolves around the sun and Darwin s discovery of the evolution of species Human megalomania will have suffered its third and most wounding blow from the psychological research of the present time which seeks to prove to the ego that it is not even the master of its own house bur must content itself with scanty information of what is going on unconsciously in its mind To say that we are largely a maner of our unconscious is to remove us from what the philosophical tradition has taught us to consider as our special relation ro reason and selfawareness a special re lation that is central to Descartes among others For Freud who each of us is concerns how we I ive the historical confl icts that characterize our early life Although the particular character of those conflicts is unique ro each of us there is a general pattern that all of them follow First those confl icts are cenrred around oral issues then anal ones Next and most important they concern the Oedipal complex or for girls the Elect ra complex Taking the boys developmenr as exemplary  which is Freuds approach the boy falls in love with his mother He would like to be rid of his father who after all is the competition for his love However he fears the consequences of his fathers wrath as Freud has it castration is the imagined consequence Therefore the boy must suppress his feelings for his mother This suppression creates an unconscious wh ich in turn swallows much of the boys preOedipal history and sets the stage for the resolution of later conflicts As Freud conceives the unconscious it is not merely a container for conflicts or a safe haven for unacceptable feelings or thoughts The unconscious does not merely receive it also expresses Just as it incorporates situations in later life repressing the elements of those situations that remind us of earlier d ifficulties so it emerges in indi rect ways in our behaviour For Freud jo kes symptoms and slips of the tongue are ways the unconscious can express itself in our behaviour without those expressions being recognized for what they are One way to describe who we are then is as a certain type of engagement with the world an engagemenr that operates largely on an unconscious economy of repression and expression This economy is one that with the help of a psychoanalyst we can come to understand at least to a certain extent We need the aid of an analyst because the unconscious has no motivation to reveal itself moreover the project of selfunderstanding is in Freuds view a neverending one Therefore each of us can through a long and often painful process and with the assistance of another come to some 6 INTRODUCTION  WHO ARE WE recogn ition of who we are and perhaps can do something to overcome those aspects of ourselves that we would rather be rid of Bur this abi lity is limited and is gained at a high price The other way to describe who we are is as a set of more or less successfully resolved confl icts This way of describing us is not in conflict with the fi rst Rather it focuses on a different aspect of Freuds view on the history rather than the topography If we are on the one hand largely an unconscious relation wi th the world it is because we are on the other a determined set of conflicts that each of us faces Those conflicts again are at once universal and individual They are universal in that they unfold according to a pattern that holds for all human beings They are individual in that that pattern is inflected in particular ways d epending on a persons particular history The conrrast between Freuds focus on the unconscious and Descartess primacy of the conscious mind could nor be sharper Although the possibility of the unconscious does not occur to Descartes it wou ld be safe to say that if it d id he would reject it It runs against the entire grain of his ph ilosophy with its focus on conscious rationality tvloreover one might well say that the idea of an unconscious vio lates the claim that God is not a deceiver since the point of the unconscious is to engage in a systematic deception of consciousness If for instance the little boy recogn izes that he is suppressing his hatred and fear of his father and later comes to understand that some of his actions express that hatred and that fear the unconscious would nor be performing irs function Although these differences are crucial there are important simi lari ties between the approaches of Descartes and Freud Two of them are fundamental for understanding Foucaults approach to rhe question of who we are their individualized approach and although it may seem to be the opposite their universal character Vhen Descartes and Freud ask who we are they approach the question by ask ing who each of us is in his or her nature The we of who we are is not a collective we It is an individual I For Descartes the answer to the question of who we are is in irs most important elements the same as the answer to the question of who each of us is Each of us is a mindsubstance and a bodysubstance engaged with each other in which the mind  the conscious rational mind  is the dominanr aspect That we could be who we are as a result of a collective experience is irrelevant for him This is not to say that he denies that people have a co llective experience It is rather to say that in undertaking to answer the question of who we are he does not consider it It is neglected rather than rejected With Freud the situation is more complicated On the one hand he does allow for collective experience In fact his book Moses and Monotheism 7 THE PHilOSOPHY O f FOUCAULT speculates that one of the seeds of the Oedipal complex may be a result of the murder of Moses by the Jewish people This would lend a historical and co llective aspect to his deve lopmental narrative In addition he allows that the particularity of a persons confl icts may be a result of his or her particular history This seems to open the door to a collective determination of who someone is an experience that one shares with others On the other hand he gives a fai rly finegrained interpretation of human development one that privileges the unfolding of the ind ividual within a developmental pattern that depends on what each individual undergoes Who we are is a matter of who each of us is in the particular way each of us resolves a predetermined set of confl icts And here we can see the intersection of the ind ividualized approach and the universal one For Freud as for Descartes the universal and the individual go hand in hand It is because they both have a universal approach to who each of us is that Freud and Descartes are focused on the ind ividual rather than the collective How can this be To the extent that one believes that who we are has a universal character that it is the same across rimes and places one will also believe that the particularities of a person s or a societys history are irrelevant in determining who one is It is to believe that what is essential about us is immune to the contingencies of a changing history To pur the point another way it is to believe that what is essential about us is something that each of us contains regardless of our or our cultures or socierys particular experiences or histor ies And rhus what makes us who we are is something that is at once t imelessly uni versal and radically ind ividual Much of the history of philosophy will confirm this strange connivance between the universal and the individual in the approach to who we are For a final example one that might seem to fly in the face of what I have just said we can look towards a more recent thinker JeanPau l Sarrre Sarrres career overlaps with Foucaults In fact he inhabits the intellectual generation that precedes Foucaults the generation of the existential ists For Sartre especially in his earlier more purely existential writings the answer to the question of who we are can be summed up in a single word  freedom Sarrre rejects any outside determination of who we are We are simply what we choose robe If thinkers like Freud and Descartes see us as having an essence it is our fare to live our Sarrre can be seen as diametrically opposed ro them Atheist existential ism which I represent   stares that if God does not exist there is at least one being in whom existence precedes essence a being who exists before he can be defined by any concept and that this being is man 9 Rather than possessing an essential nature that is inescapably ours Descartes or a specific developmental scheme that will define us Freud we are instead nothing other than what we make of 8 INTRODUCTION  WHO ARE WE ourselves We are the projects we choose to engage in What we mean is that a man is nothing else than a series of undertakings that he is the sum the organization the ensemble of the relationships which make up these undertakings 10 Sartres claim that one is nothing other than ones undertakings is inseparable from his claim that one is ones freedom They are two sides of the same coin For someone to be a free being radically free in the sense Sartre would have it is for them to be able to undertake any number of projects It is for them ro choose how ro array the future that fans our in front of them Vhen Sartre defines human beings so lely as the sum of their undertakings what he is rejecting  and the earlier quote defining atheist existentialism hints at this is the possibi lity that we are derermined by something outside us most likely God It is the JudeaChristian belief that a persons being is created in God s image that he rakes aim at For Sartre we are nor created in Gods image We are nor created in any image XIharever there is of image to be had in us is a product of our own creation Sartres answer to the question of who we are seems to reject the approach embraced by both Descartes and Freud For both of them it is an essential nature that defines us For Sartre by contrast it is precisely the lack of an essential nature that defines us One might argue here that Sartre is closer to Descartes than I am indicating here After al l might Sarrres freedom and Descartess ability to reason nor be more intimately linked than I have indicated Indeed they might I will leave that issue aside here since it does nor affect the claim I am about ro make The deep connection remains intact however Just as Descartes and Freud approach the question of who we are by means of the individual and the universal so does Sartre For Sartre what is important about each of us we can use the term essential here if we do nor confuse it with the essential ism that existentialism rejects  is our freedom Each of us is defined by our freedom And the reason for this is precisely that freedom is the crucial universal trait of human beings It is what makes us what we are or perhaps more appropriate what we are not since for Sartre who was fond of paradoxes human reality must nor be necessari ly what it is bur must be able robe what it is nor Someone fami liar with the entire trajectory of Sartres work might well object here that in focusing on the writings from the 1940s and early 1950s I have neglected his later more Marxistinspired work It is in the later work where a collective determination is assimilated to the existentialism of Sartres earl ier career I want ro turn to Marx himself in a moment This is an important issue and deserves to be paused over more than I wi ll here I can only gesture at a response Sartre does nor replace his existentialism with Marxism To claim that he does would be I believe to deny the originality of his work Instead he 9 THE PHILOSOPHY Of FOUCAULT grafts Marxism on ro exisrenrial ism

INTRODUCTION  WHO ARE WE through the world In order to caprure these aspects of who I am I cannot simply talk abom general aspects of human being And conversely neither can I just talk abom who I am as an individual  have to talk abom the world in which my navigating occurs a world that has a specific character and that has unfolded its specific character in a specific way As it will rurn om it is often the stamp of this world that in imporram ways makes me who I am makes us who we are At first we might say that we have to consider history Why history History as Foucault thinks of it is not just a maner of discrete evems or movemems that happened ro precede us Thinking of history in that way loses its connection with us with the way it has helped make us who we are Alternatively we cannot think of history as that thing we need to understand to ensure that we are not condemned to repeat ir In some sense that wou ld be the opposite of Foucaults view of history To think of history as something repeatable is ro emerrain the possibility that it has ci rcular movemems Cerra in evems that happened before us are capable in some form of remrning But that cant be right Could it possibly be that in the early rwemyfirst cemury something that happened in the Renaissance could happen again Or if we tone down the idea that something like what happened in the Renaissance could happen again Surely similar causes have similar effects Bm in srudying history we are as much at a loss ro isolate causes and effects as we are in anything else What are the causes of the French Revolmion the New Deal or global ization The idea that we repeat history even in kind is at best an elusive one In any case there is another perhaps bener way to approach our history Perhaps we should think of our history as the temporal movemem that has deposited us on these particular shores On this view history is a pan of us It is not disconnected from us in the way the approach to history as a series of d iscrete events would have it However if history is a pan of us if it helps determine who we are this is not simply in virrue of its strucrure It is not because hisrory is circular or because it takes some other shape that we are a product of it It is because this particular history with these part icular evems led us ro this place and not some other The history that has brought us here could have been differem It d id not have to rake the paths it rook If it had we ourselves wou ld be differem from who we are Bm it rook these paths which means both that we are this rather than that and in a lesson that will be equally impon am we are this rather than that as a maner of contingency not necessity Ye did not have robe this rather than that which means among other things that we do not have to cominue ro be this Already we can begin ro appreciate the distance that separates Foucault from the tradition that includes Descartes Freud and Sartre For Foucaul t 11 THE PHILOSOPHY Of FOUCAULT who we are concerns not only what human beings are at their core It is more importantly a matter of who we are now of what we have been made to be by the history that has formed us If we can recount that history or since history itself is complex those histories then we can address more adequately the question of who we are We can start to think of ourselves as something more than generalities ie can situate ourselves and see who we are in terms of that situation Foucault is not the first to think of who we are as a matter of history However he thinks of it in a new way In order to understand his view we can approach it again by contrast Here the contrast wou ld be with Karl Marx For thinkers of Foucaults generation the generation o f the 1960s and 1970s Marx occupies a central place in all political and philosophica l discussion It is hard to imagine or to remember now almost twenty years after the fall of the Berlin wall how dominant lvlarxism was on the European pol itical landscape Bur dominant it was In France for instance there was a Marxist parry the Parti Communiste Franflis PCF that ran candidates for office that had a strong grip on the trade union movement and that was the touchstone for progressive thought and action Although in the uprisings in France in May and June of 1968 the PCF began to lose credibility by siding with the government in the suppression of the smdent and worker revolts for many years before then the progressive who spoke ourside the parameters defined by Marxist thought was very much an anomaly Marx thinks of who we are as a matter of history This does not mean that he denies that there is a human essence He does have at least in his early writings a commitment to the idea that humans are a speciesbeing Man is a speciesbeing not on ly because he practically and theoretically makes the species  both his own and those of other things his object bur also  and this is simply another way of saying the same thing because he looks upon himself as the present living species because he looks upon himself as a universal and therefore free being For the early Marx this speciesbeing this being who is in its essence free productive and selfconsti tuting is alienated from itself under capital ism and requ ires a communist revo lution to be achieved Bur the fact that we have this speciesbeing even in an alienated form does not mean that history is on ly secondary for Marx In Marxs view who we are at a given moment is largely a matter of where we stand in the unfo ld ing of our history Human history can be seen as the unfolding of our productive relationship with nature and with one another For Marx human beings are part of nature bur a part of nature that in surviving and reproducing itself also refash ions nature It has been 12 INTRODUCTION  WHO ARE WE sa id that Marx reduces everyth ing to economics This may be true but Marx s view of economics is far broader than our own Economics for him is nothing less than the social interaction with the natural world through which we produce and reproduce ourselves We make ourselves and one another through the production of our lives together and this pro duction occurs as a matter of our working and reworking the material world we find ourselves in that is nature As it happens for most of human history this making and remaking occurs under conditions of scarcity There is not enough for everyone to create for themselves an adequate life People must compete for the scarce resources that are available The resu lt is that there are some who have more and others who have less There are as Marx puts it classes Those who have more can and do dominate those who have less in turn those who have less struggle against that domination The history of all hitherto existing society he declares at the outset of The Communist Manifesto  is the history of class struggles13 This relationship of struggle is not constant The character of classes as well as those who make them up changes They change wi th changing economic conditions The productive condi tions of a particular society wi ll change until the class relationsh ips that comprise those conditions no longer fit them Vhen that happens there will be a revo lution of some sort and a new set of class relationships wi ll emerge This wi ll continue unti l scarcity has been overcome For Marx the possibility of overcoming scar city is produced by capitalism because of its enormous productive capacity However the inequities of capita lism wi ll allow scarcity to rema in unti l the last revolution the communist revo lution has ended all class relationships In this view of things who we are at a particular moment is a matter of our place in history More specifically it is a matter of our place in a par ticular class in history We do not have to see Marx committing himself to the idea that the entirety of who each of us is is reducible to our class posi t ion We need not see Marx although some of h is interpreters do as a determinist who argues that everyth ing about a person is reducible to the class they occupy Marx once argued that Men make their own history but they do not make it just as they please they do not make it under circumstances chosen by themselves but under circumstances d irectly encountered given and transmitted from the past People may not be reducible to their histories but they cannot escape those histories either If we are in part at least a product of our history then is there anyth ing in particular about how our history unfolds that makes us who we are Or is our history contingent Does it un fold without any necessary pattern or order In Marxs eyes there is a pattern and it is a necessary one Recall that for him class relations change when they can no longer be sustained as 13 THE PHilOSOPHY O f FOUCAULT the economic conditions of a society evolve For instance late in the feudal world a nascent bourgeoisie arises a class that is c haracterized nor by ownersh ip of the land bur by ownership of small facrories and large workshops This rising bourgeoisie is excluded from positions of power and influence which are retained by the landed aristocracy The tension between these two classes is also and for the same reasons a tension between the structure of a society as it currently is wi th the aristocracy in a dominant position and the relationships between a group with an increasing share of economic resources the emerging bourgeoisie and a group that is relative ro this group losing theirs the old aristocracy As Marx someti mes summarizes the point there is a confl ict between the mode of production and the relations of production When this conflict becomes roo much for a given mode of production to bear then a revolution occurs that creates a new one In this case feudalism gives way to capital ism This is how history unfolds The movement accords with what Marx s predecessor Georg Hegel calls the dialectic In Hegels view history and nor just history ideas nature and much else unfolds d ialectically T here is a given si tuation T hat situation is nor a stable one It is characterized by internal tensions Eventua lly those tensions overwhelm the situation and create another situation one that is very different and perhaps even opposed at many points to the first situation However the second situarion like the first is unstable it has irs own internal tensions As the second situation unfo lds those tensions as they did in the first situation become sharper Once again they overwhelm the situation and a new situation is created This movement from internally unstable situation to rising tension to revolution to new situation is how history progresses For Hegel as for Marx history will evenmally yield a stable situation where all the important interna l tensions are resolved T hat will be the end of history at least as an evolving dialectic There are sign ificant differences between Hegels view of the dialectic of history and Marxs First for Hegel the d ialectic is as much conceptual as or even more so than ir is material Marx for h is parr sees the dialectic arising on the basis of human beings material productive relations with the natural world  Secondly Hegel believes rhar the final stage of history arrives in the course of his lifetime that he is witnessing the last stage of the dialectic For Marx the last stage of history needs another revolution the communist revolution He sees Hegels thought stopping one stage short of completion For both thinkers however there is a structure to the way history unfolds the way it makes us who we are This is where Foucault parts company with tvlarx In Foucaults view ro rake history as unfolding in accordance with a necessary pattern or structure is not to rake history seriously enough It is to submit history to 14 INTRODUCTION  WHO ARE WE a principle outside the specific movement of irs events a principle that dictates the nature or the direction of that movement H istory becomes subject to a transcendent principle outside it or an immanent principle that determines it It is as though history does nor exist on irs own terms bur is rather an example or an expression of something ahisrorical Such a view of history is essentialist in the way that Sartre sees previous views of human being as essential ist For Sartre the Genesis story of erearion in which man is created in Gods image is essential ist In this story man is simply an expression of an essence that he does nor create Man exempl ifies a nature that precedes him Sartre holds that human beings create their own natures We do nor express or exemplify pregiven ones In much the same way a Marxist view of history is essential ist It rakes history as a matter of expressing the movement of the dialectic History does nor possess irs own integrity irs existence is preceded by an essence Yie might say that in this particu lar sense history is existential in Foucaults eyes This does not mean that history creates itsel f in the way that Sartre thinks human beings create themselves T hat wou ld anthropomorphize history It is nor that history creates itself it is that it is nor created by some transcendent overarching or underlying princip le It does nor necessarily progress or regress It does nor necessarily move in a circle It does nor necessari ly repeat anything It may progress or regress or circle or repeat Bur if it does then this is because of particular local conditions that have arisen nor because it lies in the character of history itself to do so History ex ists on irs own terms and must be smdied on irs own terms T hat is what it means to say that Foucault rakes history more seriously than others like Marx who have introduced history into their account of who we are Foucault addresses the question of who we are by appeal ing to history He hopes to be able to give a richer more robust answer to that question by abandoning both the universaVindividual approach of Descartes Freud and Sanre and the ahisrorically determined historical approach embraced by Marx He jettisons the first because it neglects the role that our collective history plays in creating who we are He rejects the second because it submits that collective history to a determi ning principle and thus circles back to the universal ism of the first approach Instead Foucault sees us largely as products of a contingent history Our history has made who we are today nor because it had ro bur just because it did because at certain junctures it rook one path as opposed to another Perhaps it rook that path because of the in fluence of local events or perhaps because of some mistaken or overdetermined view of things that people had or maybe because of chance Bur for whatever reason it did And rhus we find ourselves here as opposed to there 15 THE PHilOSOPHY OF FOUCAULT We are nor barred from ever gerring rhere as opposed to here Or berrer if we are so barred ir is nor because rhe narure of rhings prevenrs ir bur because local condi tions cannor be rurned in rhar d irection There is no deep reason rhar keeps us here insread of

firsr characrerisric is rhar who we are is largely a collective marrer We 16 INTRODUCTION  WHO ARE WE cannot think of ourselves simply as individuals divorced from the historically given context in which we find ourselves There are a number of theories that seem to want to consider us as atoms as ind ividuals separable from our specific context For instance the individual ism of traditional liberal political theory seems to see us rhus Indeed liberal po litical theory has been attacked by a movement called communitarianism for allegedly neglecting our embedded ness in specific contexts Although Foucault is no communitarian he rends to view those specific contexts with a more jaundiced eye than do communitarians  he ratifies the idea that who we are is not separable from them We need not turn to political theory however to see the individualism Foucault rejects It is all around us It lies in the notion dear to many Americans that one can be whoever one likes as long as one is willing to work at it To be sure this notion has irs virtues For instance it offers optimism in the face of obstacles However it is strictly speaking mistaken on two counts First it assumes that each of us is an iso lated individual that our past and our future are not collective but individual matters Secondly and related it assumes that the conditions in which each of us finds ourselves are not deeply a part of who we are that each of us can shrug off our historically given social inheri tance and assume another This is certainly wrong I for instance wi ll always be someone who grew up in New York during the Vietnam War period My peregrinations no matter how far they lead me geographically or emotionally or chronologically from that rime and place wi ll always be informed by the legacy of being raised in that city during that period Who I am will always be at least in parr a matter of that past This is the second characteristic of Fouculrs histories It is tied to the first one that who I am is a lso inseparable from who other people are After all I was not the only person who grew up in New York at that rime There were others Some of them I have remained in contact with and others I have met later in life The recognition is always immediate There are things that we share an outlook that we can if not embrace then certainly relate to one that is foreign to many others I have met Who I am then is a collective matter not simply an individual one And irs tie to who I am runs deep For Fouculr this collective matter is common not only to a very specific rime and place It involves much wider themes larger cu ltural orientations that for him operate across Europe and sometimes the estern world as well as across a number of practices These themes are also of longer standing often centuries in duration The idea remains however that who each one of us is cannot be separated from a common his tory that has created the landscape we inhabit Commonality inseparabiliry two themes fram ing the histories of who we are that Foucault recounts 17 THE PHilOSOPHY O f FOUCAULT Bur someone will say you are not solely a person who grew up in New York during the Vietnam War You are more than that your historical determination is more complicated It comprises multiple sources that arise from vastly different arenas of experience You spent years working in the field of psychology at least until you starred reading Foucaults histories of psychology you are engaged in child rearing you teach at a university you are a serious runner you have organized on behalf of various progressive causes Surely the collective histories of these d ifferent practices are also determinative for who you are You are not simply the resu lt of being an ado lescent in New York during the late 1960s and early 1970s This is true It makes the histories of each of us complex It also makes the histories of our particular contexts complex There are norms of child rearing of university teaching of running of progressive organizing T hese norms and the practices in which they are embedded sometimes overlap and sometimes confl ict They are neither entirely liso lared from one another nor reducible to a single theme that binds them In order to study the emergence of each of them we have to look close to the ground A general history of our rimes wi ll not do Worse still a history that focused on what the leaders of the time  those anointed by the med ia the electoral political structure or by themselves  would be entirely irrelevant Ve must look where people live at the practices that they engage in or that one way or another come to engage them Over the course of his life Foucault says many things about his method often from different angles and often sh ifting depending on his current interests One of the most important and enduring however is this In this piece of research Discipline and Punish as in my earlier work the targec of analysis wasnt institut ions theories or ideology but practices   It is a question of analyzing a regime of practices  practices being understood here as places where what is said and what is done ru les imposed and reasons given the planned and the taken for granted meet and interconnect QM 75 Practices are what people live T hey determine who we are not by imposing a set of constraints from above but through historical ly given norms through which we think and act T hese historical ly given norms are once again neither divorceable from nor reducible to what people often consider their larger historical context The insistence of psychology in so many business and educational practices embedded in the larger concern with normality that is an ongoing theme of Foucaults research cannot be separated from the emergence and domination of capita lism Bur neither is 18 INTRODUCTION  WHO ARE WE it reducible to capitalism in the way that many Marxists would have it as a superstructure that is simply erected upon the economic base It is a practice or a group of practices that interact with other practices both economic and noneconomic and that share or borrow or crossfertilize or reinforce important themes all in complex ways The convergence conflict and reinforcement of practices can create effects that are unintended by those who participate in them For instance as we wil l see in detail below those who are members of monasteries in the early eighteenth century and before do not intend their rigid daily schedules to be part of the larger social development of what Foucault calls discipline a term he uses to cover the minute observation and regimentat ion of daily life under the banner of normaliry Monks of the t ime in their isolation do not foresee that their practices will intersect with those of the Prussian mi litary or the prison reformers in order to foster the rise of normality as a crucial form of the operation of power in our world However since practices intersect with one another in various ways even the relative isolation of monks cannot prevent the incorporarion of their regimented life into other practices whose convergence gives way to disciplinary control Foucault puts the point this way People know what they do they frequently know why they do what they do but what they don t know is what what they do does If practices are engaged with one another in this way then one can begin to understand the contingency of history particularly in regard to its determination of who we are The complexiry of interacting practices does not lend itself to a single overarching theme To see what is at play in our historical inheritance cannot be a matter of finding the key to unlock the mysteries of its workings it must be a matter of looking at the unfold ing the evolution and the interaction of particular practices In discovering who we are there is no privileged place to look as some Marxists would like to look at the economy There is no privileged theme to discover as some theorists wou ld like to discover progress or d ialectics or circular recurrence There are only the particularities of what has come before structured by the various practices in which we are all engaged This is not to deny that the contingency of history may give rise to important themes themes that run across large swaths of a specific historical context Foucault often seeks to understand such themes as discipl ine normalization biopolitics or in his earl ier work resemblance classificat ion and death seen as a natural development of lite What it denies is that these themes structure the unfo ld ing of history from above within or outside it These themes emerge from the unfolding of practices Once in place they may for a time react back on those practices to give them fu rther strucntre But it is not because the themes have an independence from 19 THE PHILOSOPHY Of FOUCAULT our practices that they do so it is precisely because they are inseparable from them One of the aspects and for Foucault one of the most important aspects of this inseparability of themes from practices concerns knowledge Although there are many shifts in Foucaults approach to history over the course of his career  changing from what has been called archaeology to genealogy to ethics discovering the importance o f power turning from the ex ternal consrimrion of who we are to our own selfconsrimrion  the preoccupation with knowledge remains a constant with him For Foucault knowledge is something that always happens in our practices One does nor know something from a standpoint outside the practices that make one up There is as the phi losopher Thomas Nagell puts it no view from nowhere  Our knowledge is situated in our practices This simaring has several implications First our knowledge changes as our practices change In the unfolding of our contingent history we will know things in different ways depending on the stare and structure of our practices at a particular rime To pur the po int another way we will know differently at d ifferent periods This does nor mean that nothing we know is ever true or that knowledge is mere ly a shifting opinion If Foucaults perspective is right then one cannot claim that nothing we ever know is true or that knowledge is merely a shift ing opinion Both of those views would presume that we can somehow exit our practices and with them our knowledge to obtain a view above or outside them in short a view from nowhere Bur that is precisely what Foucaults perspective precludes A second implication of the embeddedness of our knowledge in our practices is that what goes on in those practices wi ll affect how we go abou t the project of knowing Our knowing is nor on ly inseparable from our practices generally it is inseparable from the norms and doings and sayings those practices consist in This idea becomes important in Foucaults genealogical works where the theme of power emerges as a central concern of his thought If knowledge occurs within our pacrices and power arises within those same practices then there must be an intimate connection between knowledge and power In contrast to those who would like to see knowledge as something that happens apart from the impurity of power relat ionships knowledge and power are entwined Perhaps Foucault wntes we should abandon a whole tradition that allows us to imagine that knowledge can exist only where power relations are suspended   These powerknowledge relations are to be analysed therefore nor on the basis of a subject of knowledge wl1o is or is nor free in 20 INTRODUCTION  WHO ARE WE relation ro rhe power sysrem bur on rhe conrrary rhe subject who knows rhe objects to be known and rhe modalities of knowledge musr be regarded as so many effects

practices on ones own One does nor alter the practices one participates in without it having effects on others One does nor understand ones own complex history without recourse to the work of those who have also attempted to understand theirs If who we are is a collective project then so is the project of being otherwise than who we are What is certain is that the project of being orhenvise is nor  inaccessible We do nor have to be who we are currently constituted to be And in that sense we might refine the question that frames Foucaults work Rather than asking  Vho are we we might see Foucault asking the question Who are we tiOll Although much of his historical work describes a trajectory that precedes us he often ends his books by drawing lessons for the character of our current ways of being It is nor that the question of who we are is the wrong one it is rather that the question of who we are asked righ tly is the same as the question of who we are now If we turn away from timeless or inescapable answers to the question of who we are then unless we rake as our task a mere historical curiosity about who we once were the po int of our doing history the goal of our research is to understand who we are now In an essay on the philosopher Immanuel Kant Foucault makes this clear Responding roan essay of Kants entitled What is Enlightenment Foucault writes that what modernity offers us and what much of the critical project of modernity has been is a reflection on who we have been made to be and how we might escape the consrrants of that making The critical ontology of ourselves must be considered nor certainly as a theory a doctrine nor even as a permanent body of knowledge that is accumulating it must be conceived as an attitude an ethos a ph ilosophical life in which the critique of what we are is at one and the same rime the historical analysis of the limits imposed on us and an experiment with the possibility of going beyond them WE 319 Kants text is a reflection on the Enlightenment written by someone who is living through it It is an attempt to grasp to understand the present as it is happen ing T hat in Foucault s view is a striking fearure of the modern era and a legacy of the En ligh tenment it promotes a critical relation to ones present Foucaul t writes The thread which may connect us with the Enlightenment is nor fai thfulness to doctrinal elements bur rather the permanent 22 INTRODUCTION  WHO ARE WE reactivation of an artimde  rhat is of a philosophical ethos rhar could be described as a permanent critique of our historical era Ibid 312 Foucault rakes himself like Kant robe inscribed in rhar ethos Foucault is not antimodern nor is he postmodern He is at least in his own eyes precisely modern He seeks to understand the presenr and who we have been made to be in that present nor to satisfy a passing curiosity burro open up the possibility for new ways of being Foucault never does tell us aside from offering a few suggestive phrases what these new ways of being should consist in That is our task rhe task of each of us alone and many of us together His rask consists in asking about our present asking who we have come to be in rhe present Bur the task is not an idle one Rather this task requires work on our limits that is a patient labor giving form ro our impatience for liberty ibid 3 19 It is directed ar once towards our present and towards our future Ir is ar once a historical analysis and an invi tation to change It is at once the project of a single individual alone in a dusty archive immersed in faded documents and of those who engage in conversation with rhe works rhar emerge from that immersion and yer again of those who having read him or heard of his work or anticipated his words with their own lives would converge on a project of selfunderstanding and selftransformation that can use rhe material of who we are in order ro create new possibilities for who we might be Near the end of his life Foucault puts the point this way As for what motivated me ir is quite simple I wou ld hope that in the eyes of some it might be sufficient in itself ft was curiosity rhe only kind of curiosity in any case that is worth acting upon with a degree of obstinacy not the curiosity that seeks ro assimilate what it is proper for one to know bur that which enables one to get free of oneself UP 8 Vith Foucault we must ask who we are who we are now We must follow the thread of this question in his texts and rhe responses always partial that he gives Bur this path will in the end prove useless unless there is rhe passion for who we might be Foucault does nor provide rhar He can reveal the contingency of who we have been told that we are bur he cannot inflame rhe des ire to be otherwise That must come if indeed it does come from those whose own lives are at stake 23 CHAPTER TWO Archaeological histories of who we are How might we embark on a historical approach or a set of historica l approaches to address the question of who we are Because of the complex ity of our historical inheritance there are many avenues of entry No single one among of them is preferred or exhaustive There is no Archimedean point Foucault himself at different rimes in his life offers d ifferent interpretations of his own approach Usually those interpretations de pend on what is motivating him at the time he rends to see his previous writings in ligh t o f current interests There is however a traditional classification of his published writings into th ree periods archaeology genealogy and ethics The first period encompasses the time from his first major publication Histoire de Ia folie a age classique partially translated into Engl ish as lvfadness and Civilization through his last methodological work on archaeology The Archaeology of Knowledge The other major works o f that period are The Birth of the Clinic and The Order ofThings The second period is characterized by rwo major works Discipline and Punish and the first volume of The History of Sexuality The final period encompasses his last two published volumes of the history of sexual ity The Use of Pleasure and The Care of the Self If we are to give dares to these periods we might say that the archaeological period runs from 1961 unril1968 or 1969 the genealogical period unti l 1978 or so and the ethical period until his death in 1984 How usefu l is this periodizari on Although it is the standard one many have argued that the divisions in Foucaults approach are far less decisive than it wou ld seem to suggest If Foucault sees continuiry in his own work even if that continuity differs in character depending on the d ifferent stages of his career should we nor also see his writings as forming a more or less continuous who le Or if we rake Foucault seriously in those moments where he seems to say that each o f his texts is a singular experiment should we nor jettison periodizarion from the other end Should we nor argue against periodizarion precisely because there is nothing li ke a continuous 24 ARCHAEOLOGICAL HISTORIES OF WHO WE ARE whole characterizing his works nor even an important continuity between any one and irs successor There are reasons ro embrace any of these readings of his corpus Ye wi ll at least roughly fol low periodization here although along the way I wi ll point our reasons to be leery of it There wi ll be reasons to see the cont inuity and reasons to see the singularity of each work Ye cnnor treat all of his works here without betraying the riches that each brings we wi ll focus on those most often discussed And even so betrayal will be inevitable Throughout our readings however there will be a single theme that returns one that characterizes the entire trajectory of Foucaults publicat ions What all these periods have in common is that they are framed by a historical concern with the emergence of who we are The history of madness The history of madness in Histoire de Ia folie is h is first major work It is the firsr work where he speaks in his own voice the voice that will be recognized over the course of the rest of his career Before the book on madness and in keeping with the intellectual tenor of the time in Europe Foucault writes under the convergent influences of phenomenology and Marxism In an interview he speaks of this ea rly period we should nor forget that throughout the period from 1945 ro 1955 in France the entire French university  the young French university as opposed to what had been the trad itional university  was very much preoccupied with the task of building something which was nor FreudianMarxist bur HusserlianMarxist the phenomenologyMarxism relation That is what was at stake in the debates and efforts of a whole series of people Maurice MerleauPonry and Sarrre in moving from phenomenology ro Marxism were definitely operating on that axis CTIH 21 Histoire de Ia folie breaks decisively with the early project Phenomenology rakes a persons subjective experience to be the crucial object of investigation It seeks to understand the structure of a person s experience to unfo ld that which although experienced needs to be reflected upon in a r igorously descriptive way if it is to become accessible to the understanding Foucaults book on madness rejects phenomenology It sh ifts the ground from the project of unpacking and derail ing an experience that has nor yet 25 THE PHilOSOPHY O f FOUCAULT been fully clarified to a historical investigation of the different structures for treating madness It is those structures that frame the subjective experience Rather than asking as the phenomenologists d id  What is it like to experience suchandsuch Foucault asks instead What are the shift ing historical frameworks within which suchandsuch  in this case madnessis experienced  The investigat ion no longer concerns what the ind ividual undergoes it concerns the historical conditions of their undergoing it  If we use terms loosely we might say that the axis of investigation has shifted from inside the individual to outside In order to grasp these shifting historical frameworks we cannot rake madness as an objective given It is not that there is this disease or this structure or this way of being called madness that has been experienced d ifferen tly in different historical periods Why should we assume that beneath the frameworks within which madness is t reated there is some constant that informs them all This wou ld assume roo much Alternative ly we need not assume the opposite that there is nothing that any of these frameworks is looking at that they are all preoccupied with an illusion Rather we should make no assumptions about the object of study and treatment called madness Yie should look at the historical frameworks for what they are and more important for what they reveal to us about ourselves rather than for what they may or may not reveal about the object of their investigation In order to do this Foucault suggests that we return to the point at wh ich madness becomes distingu ished from reason We must try to return in history to that zero po int in the course of madness at which madness is an undifferentiated experience a not yet divided experience of division itself MC ix T he experience of madness emerges from a historical contex t in which madness first appears as such as an experience distinct from reason Foucault begins his investigation just before that context in order to trace irs development In the Middle Ages he writes madness does not have a distinct character or at least it does not have the character we have come to ascribe to it as the O ther of reason Instances of what we would call madness are woven more seamless ly into the fabric of medieval experience As the Middle Ages come to a close however the figure of madness begins to appear Soon the mad wi ll rake the place both figuratively and literally of the medieval leper The houses of leprosy will be cleared They will at least in parr be replaced by the madhouses As lepers were once rl1e object of practices and rituals of exclusion hidden at the edges of medieval life in lazar houses now the mad will occupy their place It will be the same gesture in any case exclusion and confinement In what gu ise do the mad begin to make their appearance  that is their appearance as mad Foucault answers this question by appeal to the 26 ARCHAEOLOGICAL HISTORIES OF WHO WE ARE arresting image of the Ship of Fools Ships of Fools were said to be ships that towns filled with their mad sending them off on uncerta in journeys but at least ridding the towns of their presence Why however would their presence constintte a threat In the late medievan and early Renaissance period madness comes to be associated with mysterious nether regions It is associated with animality with darkness and ultimately wi th death The dawn of madness on the horizon of the Renaissance is first perceptible in the decay of Gothic symbolism as i f that world whose network of spiritual meanings was so closeknit had begun to unravel showing faces whose meaning was no longer clear except in the forms o f madness MC 18 In the disintegration of the medieval perspective madness appears as the indecipherable symbol of hidden truths It is the dark underside of existence that can neither be escaped nor understood As such it is an object of both fascination and repulsion In Foucaults eyes it is no accident that two of the major authors of the time Cervantes and Shakespeare often give madness pride of place in their works For Cervantes the figure of Don Quixote constitutes a madness that is at once fool ish and wise but in any case possessed of an unsenling power In Shakespeares plays one need only refer to the madness of Hamlet or the twisted truths of King Lears fool to recognize the importance he accorded the mad experience The Ship o f Fools encapsulates this combination of fascination of repu lsion On the one hand the ships are objects of painting o f discussion and of public policy On the other their purpose is to depart to leave and to let human kind alone Do these ships actua lly exist Foucault says they did Other historians are sceptical Later after recounting Foucaults own history of madness we wi ll need to return to the question of the historical status of his account Is his account accurate and what effect might particular inaccuracies have upon it For the moment these questions can be placed to the side What is clear is that the ambiguous status enjoyed by madness during the late medieval and early Renaissance period decl ines and by the seventeenth century madness is no longer the figure of darkness or of death There is a historical break Madness becomes more pedesnian It is not a stalking ani mal within each of us nor is it a sign of impending d isintegration it becomes mere folly During the Renaissance madness was at times also conceived as fo lly but not as mere folly Madness is here at the heart o f things and o f men an iron ic sign that misplaces the true guideposts between the real and the 27 THE PHILOSOPHY Of FOUCAULT chimerical barely retaining the memory of the great tragic threats  a life more disturbed than disturbing an absurd agitation in society rhe mobility of reason MC 37 One can glimpse this change in the rrearmenr o f madness in Descartess Meditations Recall rhe movemenr of doubt rhar is Descartess method of philosophical reflection In order ro arrive at what must necessarily be t rue what cannot be suspect and whar therefore can serve as the foundation of the rest of our knowledge one must doubt everything that cannot be held certain The senses are doubted Mathematical knowledge is doubted Descartes even raises the possibility of an Evi l Genius rhar systematically deceives him and clouds his thought What is nor enrerrained what cannot reasonably be enrerrained is the possibility rhar one is mad When doubting rhe senses Descartes raises rhe possibi lity rhar one is mad only ro dismiss ir and then approach the issue from another direction rhar one is asleep As for madness he writes how could I deny rhar these hands and this body are mine un less I am ro compare myself with certain lunati cs whose brain is so troubled and befogged by the black vapors of the bile rhar they conrinual ly affirm rhar they are kings whi le they are paupers   or rhar their body is glass Bur this is ridicu lous such men are fools and I would be no less insane than they if I followed their example The problem rhar madness raises may be a true p roblem One can reasonably doubt the evidence of the senses including the ev idence one has of the character of ones own body After all in dreams we experience at rimes the disintegration of our bodys character and capacities If the problem of doubt can be susta ined by sleep however it cannot by way of madness Madness is outside the pale because it is outside the province of truth As Foucault writes In the economy of doubt there is a fundamenral disequ ilibrium between madness folie on the one hand and dream or error on rhe other Their situation is d ifferenr in their re lationship ro rrurh and ro what is being sought dreams or illusions are surmounred in the structure itse lf of truth bur madness is excluded by the subject who doubts HFAC 57 Dreams and il lusions can place our beliefs in doubt because they still inhabit rhe realm of rhe true and rhe false Ve can rhink about them consider them hold them before the light of rrurh and the shadow of fa lsity In a 28 ARCHAEOLOGICAL HISTORIES OF WHO WE ARE word they are subject to reason Madness is nor Jr is beyond or perhaps beneath the structure of truth If man can always be fooled thought as exercise of the sovereignty of a subject that is obl iged to perceive the truth cannot be insane HFAC 58 Whence this change in attitude towards madness How did madness lose irs fascination How did it fall from its initial status as symbol of our darker regions to a subject unworthy of the project of thought Foucault does not say During this period of his thought he focuses more emphatically than he does later on the discontinuities between historical periods As he explains later in his methodological study The Archaeology of Knowledge the great problem presented by such historical analyses is not how continuities are established  the problem is no longer one of tradition of tracing a line but one of division of limits it is no longer one of lasting foundations but one of transformations that serve as new foundations the rebuilding of foundations AKDL 5 We shall return to this idea later but it is worth recognizing one of the motivations for his emphasis on discontinuity It is to prevent us from thinking that we can hold our history and indeed ourselves clearly before us If thought has ruptures if it has breaks then it is not on a continuous path of progress toward the Truth Yie can no longer think that one day we wi ll know ourselves that nothing will escape our intellectual gaze The progressive view of history that view of history that cells us we are on a path that leads inevitably closer to the truth of things is a temptation that must be fought Introducing discontinuities into history is one way to do ir because it stymies the attempt to see each histor ical period as a further development or refinement of the previous one There is for Foucault always an Other or O thers to our thought Or to pur the point another way though t can always be otherwise than it is There is always more to think than our current categories would lead us to believe This should nor be surprising for a writer whose first major work approaches madness as the Other of reason Returning then ro Descartess dismissal of madness Foucault sees in it not a singu lar event and nor as we just saw a cause of a new way of treating madness Descartes is nor the initiator of a new approach ro madness His dismissal of madness is itself a reflection of a larger shift in the relation between reason and madness It is emblematic rather than initiating There is at this time however another greater emblem of the change in reasons relation to madness Foucault marks the date of this change as 1656 fifteen years after the publication of Descartess Meditations That year sees the decree that establ ishes in Paris the Hopiral General The Hopiral General is 29 THE PHILOSOPHY Of FOUCAULT hardly the only large insrimrion of confinement in France lr certainly is nor the first In addition ro o lder established hospitals there are the abandoned lazar houses that will soon be housing the mad What makes this particular institution unique is something else  the Hopi tal General is nor a medical establishment It is rather a sort of semijudicial structure an administrative entity which along with the already constituted powers and ou tside of the courts decides judges and executes MC 40 W ithin a few months of the establishment of this sem ij udicial srrucmre Foucault says nearly one per cent of the population of Paris finds itself confined ro one hospital or another Is one per cent ofrhe population mad Does the decree of 1656 allow the pol ice authoriti es to diagnose Descartess fools on every street corner in Paris and elsewhere since as Foucault makes clear the Grear Confinement is nor limited ro Paris or even ro France No lr is not a question simply of round ing up the mad Rather there is a more general sensibility in which madness finds itself caught up Between labor and idleness 111 the classical world ran a line of demarcation that replaced the exclusion of leprosy The asylum was substituted for the lazar house in the geography of haunted places as in the landscape of the moral universe The old rites of excommunication were revived bur in the world of production and commerce Ibid 57 It is work as an economic and moral matter that structures the rise of the Great Confinement Those who can work are morally worthy those who cannot are to be excluded We must be careful here nor ro see a false h istorical continuity rhar Foucault seems robe suggesting It may appear rhar there is a historical constant a role of exclusion or excommunication that must be played by somebody Earlier iris leprosy that plays rhar ro le later it is madness and the refusal or inability to work This seems to me to be a misreading of Foucaults intent T he rhetoric is indeed suggestive bur I rake it as linle more than that There is an earlier exclusion and a later one They share similar r intals and even some overlapping sites But that is all There is no universal or absolute need for exclusion that is p layed our now upon one parr of the population and later upon another Rather there are various inclusions and exclusions that occur in given socia l and historical contexts Foucault is fo llowing a particular one recognizing at the same rime that ir is not the only one In any case reasons view of madness during the period of the Grear Confinement occurs through the lens of work madness was perceived 30 ARCHAEOLOGICAL HISTORIES OF WHO WE ARE through a condemnation of idleness and in a social immanence guarameed by the community of labor ibid 58 Madness is parr of a larger phenomenon that Foucault labels unreason The person of reason is engaged in work He more likely than she in this historical period is parr of the community of labouring beings that rakes his sense of himself from that engagemem To labour is nor simply an economic maner It is also and more deep ly a moral one As Foucault notes the cheap labour provided by the houses of confinemem does not yield much economic value In fact by competing with work omside those houses it may do more economic damage than good Bm prosperity is nor the issue here One works nor in order to comribme a certain amoum to the greater social wealth  one works because it is the righ t thing to do People of reason labour To refuse to labour is to be a creamre of unreason And to be a creamre of unreason is to invite exclusion from the community at once moral and geographical of those who recognize and engage in the work that is a persons calling Madness then is swept up in the larger phenomenon of unreason It does however occupy a d istinctive place that of animality The mad person is one who has descended or regressed imo an an imal stare That is why Foucault says although in most cases unreason the refusal to work is hidden during this period madness is allowed robe displayed Madness is an object lesson 1 shows how far human beings can descend imo unreason from the state of madness If reason is distinct b oth from unreason and from an imal ity then the madman exhibits the link between the lan er rwo clearly and in doing so shows by comrasr what ir is to be fully human The view of madness as animal ity is in keep ing with Descartess own theoretical exclusion of madness If for Descartes madness is the inability to engage in reason for the emirery of what Foucault terms the classical period roughly the midd letolate sevemeenth to the end of the eigh reemh cemury madness is treated as a particular form of general unreason a descem imo bestiality that cannot share in what makes us who we are Ve are far removed here from the madness of the earlly Renaissance There is nothing mystical or threatening abom the mad nothing to give one pause over the fragility of ones ex istence or the powers that threaten it The an imal in man no longer has any value as the sign of a Beyond it has become his madness wirhom relation to anything bm itse lf his madness in the state of namre ibid 74 We must be careful here nor to imerprer the fall imo the state of namre in terms of a framework closer to our own We are used to seeing in the an imal the absence of free will To descend imo nature is to be caught up in determinism Ve are the story goes an imals ourselves bm animals that however one accounts for it possess a free will that allows us to recognize and to extricate ourselves from the immediacy of our circumstances We 31 THE PHILOSOPHY Of FOUCAULT are nor like a wasp or a squirrel that is bound to its instincts reduced to irs hardwiring Vhen we think of the descent into animality that is how we are tempted to rhink of it This would be a mistake It is nor on this horizon of nature that the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries recognized madness bur against a background of Unreason madness did nor d isclose a mechan ism bur revealed a liberty raging in the monstrous forms of animal it ibid 83 Madness in the classical period does nor harbour a determinism instead it harbours a licentious freedom a freedom that cannot be harnessed to the requirements of reason It is this reason in turn that is the recogn ition of the constraining requ irements of a civil ized society and above all the requ irement of VOrk Treatments of madness then although they may seem to our eyes to be crude forms of medical intervention should not be interpreted in this way Madness is nor yet mental illness it is nor yet to be submi tted to the medical model At this extreme point madness was less than ever linked to the domain of correction Unchained animality could be mastered only by discipline and brutalizing ibid 75 Madness is u ltimately a moral matter and must be treated as such Madness wi ll be treated and Foucault details a number of the treatments that madness receives from immersion in water to the administration of bitters and to travel However that treatment rema ins caught in the ethical web that the classical period weaves around its view of the mad Being both error and sin madness is simultaneously impurity and sol itude it is withdrawn from the world and from truth bur it is by rhat very fact imprisoned in evi l ibid 17 5 In the second half of the eighteenth century th ings change aga in A new orientation toward madness arises one that sets the stage for our more contemporary view Ve are not yet at the inauguration of the contemporary view that will have to await the interventions of Samuel Tuke and Philippe Pinel However a couple of the themes that will soon receive their full articulation in the work of these two emerge before their appearance on the stage of madness In the second half of the eighteenth century the unity of unreason begins to unravel Poverty comes ro be distingu ished from madness nor only in the latters character as pure l ibertine animality bur in the association of madness now with indolence rather than impoverishment During the latter half of the eighteenth century it is the rich rather than the poor who are at risk of madness How does the link berween poverty and unreason come undone Here Foucault offers a causal explanation rather than as usual simply demarcating a break In the economic change from mercanti lism to industrial ism there arises a need for unskilled labour Mercanti lism rel ies on trade and smallscale production Industrialism requires a large labour pool 32 ARCHAEOLOGICAL HISTORIES OF WHO WE ARE Therefore confin ing those who are able to perform unskil led labour in the name of unreason begins ro run coumer to rhe emerging economic imperatives In rhe mercamile economy rhe Pauper being neither producer nor consumer had no place idle vagabond unemployed he belonged only to confinemem  With rhe nascem industry which needs manpower he once again plays a parr in rhe body of rhe narion ibid 230 We musr be careful in approach ing chis sh ift of concern abour madness from poor ro rich since ir remains a sh ifr on more or less rhe same ground Madness is sri II tied ro rhe absence of work Bur rhe absence of work is no longer ried ro impoverishment ir finds new moorings among rhe idle rich  The release from work brings wirh ir an unbournd leisure one that can loosen a persons ties to the world of reason and work For Foucault this new view of madness can be located particularly in three themes the association of madness with excess wealth the bond posited between madness and an immodest religious fervour and a concern that arises around too much read ing and speculation These are preoccupations of the rich It is those who do not have to labour char have an excess of wealth ir is they who are ready ro embrace new religious fads and ir is they who have rhe rime for reading and speculation All of these occur ar rhe expense of a labour that keeps ones feet on rhe ground chat prevems one from drifting off imo the ethereal realm where madness lies ready ro weave irs spell This shift is accompanied by a general withdrawal from rhe project of confinemem The poor being creatures of unreason could be confined in large numbers wirhour harm to society Now they musr be reintegrated They are not to be replaced by rhe rich even rhough rhey have become objects of the fear of madness As we noted before Foucault does nor believe rhar rhere must always be an exiled or confined group Confinemem is nor a historical constant rhat is foisted upon differem groups ar differem rimes With rhe rise of the industrial economy rhe fracturing of rhe uniry of unreason and in France ar least the humanist pretensions of rhe French Revolution confinemem irself begins to lose irs grip as a cure for social ills lr is in rhe wake of chis loss of confinements grip rhar Tuke and Pinels project at rhe end of rhe eighteenth cemury of rhe  liberation of rhe mad is able ro take place Before turning to their work it is worth pausing a momem over rheir historical repurarion Tuke and Pinel are canonized in rhe history of psychology and psychiatry for breaking rhe chains  often lireral ones  of confinement rhat umil their time are the lor of rhe rhose deemed mad It is they who recogn ize the brural iry of confinemem and heroically step in to end ir and to create newer more humane methods of treating madness Modern psychotherapy often traces irs lineage back to these figures who it is claimed are the first to imervene on behalf of rhose 33 THE PHILOSOPHY Of FOUCAULT who are mentally ill rather than against them The establishment of Tukes Quaker Retreat in England and Pinels order to remove the chains of those confined at the hospital at Bicerre together form the moment at which modern psychiatry is born They mark the moment of the birth of the hospi tal as asylum as a space o f cure in contrast to the previous age of hospitals as places marked solely by their role as institutions of confinement There are three questions one might pose ro this account First does the work of these two figures by their own efforts destroy the idea that confinement is the proper way to treat madness As we have seen it does nor Confinement comes into disrepute before rhe end of the eighteenth century T heir work although contributing ro irs demise does nor by itself create it The historical break has already taken place before Pinel arrives at the door of Bicetre in 1793 Secondly what are we to make of the brutality exhibited toward the mad From our perspective the confinement of the mad is undoubtedly barbarous We should bear in mind however rhar this barbarity is nor intended to be so It is not anger or a desire for vengeance or mere cruelty that motivates the confinement of the mad in the seventeenth and eighteenth cenntries It is the entire organization of the re lation between reason and madness Given the view of madness as a type of unreason rooted in a libertine an imal ity confinement makes a certain kind of sense The fact that it does so does nor exonerate it It is nor that confinement is or has ever been a good thing just because people once felt they had reason to confine any more than US slavery wou ld be justified by the fac t that Europeans believed Africans to be inferior T he point rather is the historical one that what Tuke and Pinel intervene upon is nor an intended brutality but the remnants of a way of looking at madness If the brutality of the class ical period toward the mad is unrecogn ized as such this can lead one to ask whether there is an unrecognized brutal ity in the treatment of the mad in our age This is the third question the most important and most unsettling one We look upon the treatment of madness in the classical period and see an unremitting crue lty in their confinement That we do so is as we just saw half right Bur why do we miss the other half Because we believe ourselves to be enligh tened  both morally and scientifically  about madness in ways that our predecessors are nor However do nor those in the classical period see themselves as enl ightened Their thought is nor inco herent and gven the framework that Foucault depicts their theories about and actions towards what they rake to be madness are neither arbitrary nor baseless Is it possible that we because we see history as progressive and in particullar as progressing towards where we now stand are blind to our own barbarities towards what was once called madness and is now called mental il lness 34 ARCHAEOLOGICAL HISTORIES OF WHO WE ARE It is chis d ismrbing possibility char Foucault pursues in his chaprer on Tuke and Pinel Whar he discovers is something orher rhan rhe srory rhat has been handed down ro us abour rhe heroism of rheir actions Tuke and Pinel do nor liberate madness from irs chains rarher rhey change rhe composition of rhose chains From rhen on ir is nor iron rhar would bind rhose declared mad Their bonds wi ll be less obvious bur more pervasive Instead of rhe physical bonds of confinemem henceforth rhere wi ll be rhe moral bonds of shame and gu ilr Consider rhis passage quored in Madness and CivilizAtion regarding one of rhe firsr of rhe mad whose chains Pinel removes Pinel

medical personage ibid 269 This elevation ar once creates a nearly unshakeable rrusr in rhe docror and in rhe same gesrure lends an aura of rhe sacred ro rhe docrorpariem relationship I can recall rhe

and the sane There is no more commerce between those who are isolated as mad and those who sir in judgemenT on them than there is when unreason is segregated and confined The science of menral disease as ir wou ld develop in the asy lum wou ld always be only of the order of observat ion and classification It wou ld nor be a dialogue ibid 250 This is nor ro claim that physical bondage is better than the moral rrearmenrs that remain in force today Although here one might as k what the role of the recenr dominance of pharmacological approaches to madness might play does this represenr another historical break in the perspective on and rrearmenr of madness It is rather ro stake our three positions First it is a misnomer to speak of the liberation of the mad A shift in consrrainrs is misdescribed by the term liberation Secondly this sh ift does nor heal the rifr between what is called madness and what is called sanity The rifr in the conversation between madness and reason rhar Foucault describes emerging through the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries is a legacy that we have nor yet escaped As Foucault says The language of psychiatry which is a monologue of reason abo11t madness has been established only on the basis of such a silence ibid x xi Finally all this can be understood only if we abandon the view of history as a movement of progress History is nor of its nature progressive it does nor necessari ly move from the more primitive co the more enl ightened from the barbaric to the civi lized History has neither telos  a goal  nor a structured movemenr We can see this clearly if we abandon our commitment ro historical conrinuiry and allow ourselves ro see breaks instead moments in which one way of looking is replaced by another not as an improvement on or a refinement of the earlier way bur simply as a new framework or perspective What do we make of Foucaults history of madness It is an early work one about which Foucault periodically expresses reservations However one can ask abour the character of its larger project What does this history seek ro do What is irs point For the phi losopher Jacques Derrida Histoire de Ia folie is a grand attempt that is by the nature of its project a necessary fa ilure In Derridas view Foucault has attempted  and this is the greatest merit bur also the unfeasibiliry of the book ro write a history of madness itself 3 Foucault tries in this book to heal the rift that rhe classical age has created He seeks ro pur madness back in d ialogue with reason ro restore the voice of madness that reason s monologue has suppressed This Derrida argues is a project rhar cannot succeed One cannot speak in the name of madness wirhour speaking as the mad do Otherwise one 36 ARCHAEOLOGICAL HISTORIES OF WHO WE ARE speaks for them in the language of reason One continues the monologue rather than establ ishing a dialogue ls nor an archaeology even of silence a logic rhar is an organized language a project an order a sentence a syntax a work  Nothing with in this language and no one among those who speak ir can escape the historical guilt if there is one and if ir is historical in a classical sense  which Foucault apparen tly wants to pur on trial Bur such a trial may be impossible for by the simple fact of their articulation the proceedings and the verd ict unceasingly reiterate the crime The charge levelled against Foucault here is one that has come to be clled a performarive contradiction Foucault betrays in act what he claims ro want in theory In Derridas eyes this is the inescapable fare of Foucault s project One cnnor construct an archaeology rhar seeks ro restore the voice of madness An archaeology must be arricu lared in a systematic fashion It must be a project of reason Therefore it cnnor bring us any nearer ro the mystic bur irrational sense of mad speech rhar madness has in the early Renaissance and even less so to the rime in which madness is nor d ifferentiated as a particular experience Is this in fact what Foucault is after in his discussion of madness Derrida relies on a quote from the preface to the book one that follows the citation above that the language of psychiatry which is a monologue of reason about madness has been established only on the basis of such a silence The rexr continues I have nor tried to write the history of that language bur rather the archaeology of rhar silence MC xi This seems to Derrida ro imply rhar what is at issue is a discussion nor from the standpoint of reason bur from rhar of those who have been named mad by reason and then silenced However we need nor interpret rhe passage this way As Derrida points our the project such an interpretation calls for would be an impossible one Moreover it does nor seem to be in keeping with the rest of the book which is indeed a history of how the mad have been categorized as such discussed and treated Perhaps it would be better to turn things around Rather than interpreting the book in ligh t of this suggestive bur nor entirely clear passage it would be best to interpret this passage on the basis o f the book that follows it In order to do that we should pause over the passages term archaeology Foucaults methodological reflection The Archaeology of Knowledge appears in 1969 eight years after the first edition of Histoire de Ia folie  As 37 THE PHILOSOPHY Of FOUCAULT Foucault notes in the latter book the methodology he attempts to construct there is not meant to be a faithful reflection of what goes on in the earlier books T he books he refers to are Histoire de Ia Folie the book on medicine The Birth of the Clinic and the book we shall discuss shortly The Order of Things In French ririe of the last book isLes Mots et les chases which in English means Words and Things The Archaeology of Knowledge does nor simply reconstruct a common methodology employed in the earl ier works This in any case would be fruitless since their approaches although broadly simi lar differ somewhat from book to book Instead Foucault seeks to articulate a methodology that those books are to a greater or lesser ex tent attempts to ach ieve Nevertheless much o f the broad framework he offers there does capture what is going on in the earlier works In the conclusion to The Archaeology of Knowledge Foucault sums up his ea rlier projects this way The posiriviries I have tried to establ ish must nor be understood as a set of determinations imposed from the outside on the thought of individuals or inhabiting them from the inside in advance as it were they constitute rather the set of conditions in accordance with which a practice is exercised in accordance wi th which that practice gives rise to partially or totally new statements and in accordance with which it can be modified AKDL 208 9 Vhar Foucault has in mind here is a very precise approach to history one that resists the idea of continuities and the idea rlu t the historical structure of knowledge in a given practice or group of practices during a given period can be changed by the conscious efforts of individuals to change it for example Tuke and Pinel  For Foucault there are certain regu larities that govern what can and cannot legitimately be sa id in particular practices at particular rimes It is nor that it is impossible to say certain things The I imitation is nor a physical or a legal one It is rather episremic rhar is it has to do with knowledge If certain unacceptable things are said or if things are said that might be acceptable if uttered by the right authorities bur nor by this particular person they will simply nor be recognized It would be li ke a spectators getting up in a courtroom to declare an accused person either innocent or gui lty Such a gesntre wou ld nor be recognized ln fact the person would probably be though t mad These regularities function as rules of a sort Bur they are nor conscious ru les dictating what can be said They are nor recognized as limitations by the speakers who are bound by them In addition these regu larities do nor channel speech into particular claims they allow for the possibility of 38 ARCHAEOLOGICAL HISTORIES OF WHO WE ARE debate and contradiction Instead they are unconscious strucrurings of discourse setting the character and boundaries of how debate and discussion can happen A couple of years later in the English preface to The Order of Things Foucault famously refers to these strucrurings as  the pos itive unconscious of knowledge OT xi  T hese strucrnrings are not principles dictated by the outside transcending the practice itse lf and then imposed on it Bur neither are they a set of boundaries and conditions agreed upon by the participants T hey are the framework the perspective by means of which 1 the participants in d iscussion recognize one another in their proper role as participants and 2 the statements of those participants are recogn ized as contributions to a particular discussion or as establish ing certain points or as making certain claims or as performing certain acts Foucault introduces the term archive and says chat the archive defines a particular level that of a practice that causes a multiplicity of statements to emerge as so many regu lar events as so many things to be dealt with and manipulated AKDL 1305 On that basis he defines an archaeo logy Archaeology describes discourses as practices specified in the element of the arch ive ibid 131 Here we can see the elusive idea Foucault is trying to capture In cont rast to a view of history as continuous or progressive archaeo logy takes history to involve particular scructurings of what can and cannot legi timately be said as well as how and by whom they can legitimately be said dur ing certain periods or at least in certain groups of practices during those periods a point to which we shall return Those st rucrurings can and do change W hen they change this is not because of an improvement in knowledge or through the efforts of an individual although those things can contribute to a change Foucault as we saw earlier does not say much abou t why they change Bur because knowledge is structured in this way however the change happens it constitutes a break or a r ift with the previous strucruri ng If we interpret Foucaults archaeology of si lence in this way then Histoire de Ia folie does not appear to be what Derrida says it seeks to be There is no such thing as an archaeology of si lence if by that we mean a historical account of what is suppressed of what is not allowed to express itself T he book on madness is not a book about madness It is a book about reason about reason s monologue on madness Uhat Histoire de Ia folie seeks is not to give vo ice to those who have been labelled mad as Derrida points our no archaeology can do thar Rather it articulates the various ways in which once madness is established as such the discourse on madness is structured The account of these structurings happens in three successive stages the Renaissance the classica l period  and the early modern period The focus however is on the classical period If we see things this way the history we have su mmarized makes more 39 THE PHilOSOPHY OF FOUCAULT sense and is more coherent T he book is an archaeology of the historical srructurings the arch ives of reason in irs monologue upon madness What then do we make of the phrase the archaeo logy of that silence It is nor an archaeo logy of a silence itself bur rather an archaeology of a silencing of the forms it has taken the successive structures of the discussions it has el icited the practices of experimentation and treatment to which it has given rise To pur the po int another way it is nor an archaeology of the mad it is an archaeology of us the ones who are caught up in reason  Histoire de Ia folie is a discussion of who we are It focuses on one of the most important aspects of our being our reason It discusses the way in which reason has established then maintained the esrablislunent of irs Other that which lies outside it that against wh ich it defines and defends itself Moreover it suggests that reason is to be thought of as something other than a timeless human quality Far from being the essential core of who we are as philosophers from at least Descartes up to the present day have thought reason is a mutating historical project It rakes different forms at d ifferent rimes In much of the classical period for instance reason is aligned with a certain morality a morality that was itself allied with labour Reason Foucault suggests is bound to several conditions from which it has a lways distanced itself history everyday practices and its Other Reason is neither timeless nor ethereal It is instead temporal and grounded in our world One might say of it what Foucault later says about truth during an interview Truth is a thing of this world it is produced only by virtue of multiple forms of constraint    Each society has irs general pol itics of truth that is the types of d iscourse which it accepts and makes function as true the mechanisms and instances which enable one to distinguish t rue and fa lse statements the means by which each is sanctioned    TP 131 The lesson of Histoire de Ia folie does nor concern those who have been called mad at least nor directly It concerns those of us who have nor fallen under that label It is contrary ro Derridas read ing a coherent discussion of who we have been and of who we have become and it is addressed to those who are capable of both understanding that discussion and recognizing themselves in it T he book leaves us at the th reshold of our particular structuring of reason It offers witness to irs historical birth and allows us to see the origin from which it came Bur is it accurate Are the facts that Foucault brings forward in the book 40 ARCHAEOLOGICAL HISTORIES OF WHO WE ARE acmal facts Do the facts point in the direction Foucault suggests There has been some historical assessment of Foucaul ts works al though those who read Foucault philosophically and those who read him historically are unformnarely rarely in dialogue with each other My own orientation is ph ilosophica l so I can offer little in the way of historical judgement of his work However this is an area that should not be ignored Some historians have found his work compelling6 Others have criticized it from a viewpoint that seems foreign to his projects offering claims of fact that seem to oppose his perspective bur do nor or claims that are irre levant to his perspective Sti ll others have quibbled with some of his claims bur found his overall perspective intrigu ing In order at least to get a sense of the historica l debate about Foucaults work we can focus on an article that is particularly critical of Foucaults history It illustrates both what kinds of critique might be relevant and what might be less so An article by the historian H C Midelforr7 takes issue with a number of historical claims Foucault offers Among his historical criticisms we can isolate four of them for discussion First Midelforr claims that contrary to Foucaults assumption there is no record of such a thing as a Ship of Fools There are references to deportat ion and exi le of mad persons to be sure   Occasionally the mad were indeed sent away on boats Bur nowhere can one find reference to real boats loaded wi th mad pilgrims searching for their lost reason Secondly the grand renfermement Great Confinement was aimed not at madness or even at deviance bur at poverty9 Moreover this confinement is motivated nor by a new srrucmre of reason bur by an ecclesiastical tradition of long standing that banished the poor T hirdly for the mad at least the period of confinement does not end with the emergence of a new view of the relation of reason to madness In fact it is only recently that the use of large institutions for the insane has come under criticism Virh regard to madness therefore we are witnessing the end of the age of confinement on ly now as drug therapy and communi ty mental health centers increase in popularity at the expense of inpatient hospitals Finally Foucaults history is insensitive to differences across Europe He privileges the French experience at the expense of other countries that have treated the mad very differently from France Related to this Foucault neglects the internal history of France There is roo much diversity in any g iven period to reduce it all to a particular structuring especially one of reason The first criticism is an example of an irrelevant fact Foucault does indeed claim that there were Ships of Fools sent away by towns in search of their reason However nothing hangs on the fact that there were not There were works of art depicting Ships of Fools and those considered 41 THE PHILOSOPHY Of FOUCAULT mad were indeed sent away as Midelforr says and often on boars W har Foucault is interested in is rhe rise of a certain fascination wirh madness The existence of beliefs and arr abou t Ships of Fools regardless of rhe real existence of such ships has no bearing on rhe emergence of rhis fascination The second criticism rhar ir is poverry rarher than madness rhar motivates rhe Grear Confinement is one rhar Foucault largely agrees wirh  He points our as we saw rhe link between reason moral ity and work Moreover he rraces rhe decline in confinement ro a d ifferent view of poverry Midelforr might insist here rhar be rhar as ir may ir is ecclesiastical tradition rarher rhan a change in rhe character of reason rhar morivares rhe confinement Bur rhar raises rhe question of why ir happens ar rhis particular moment rarher rhan earlier If there is no change in rhe way people see things why do rhe aurhoriries sudden ly starr confining large numbers of their fel low citizens Although Foucault does nor offer a causal history of events rhar led ro rhe Grear Confinement he does offer a view of how people saw things such rhar confinement begins ro make sense ar rhar rime when ir would nor have earlier Ascribing confinement ro a longstanding ecclesiastica l tradition does nor explain rhis The rhird criticism is an important although perhaps nor critical one Ir raises rhe question of rhe relation of physical confinemenr ro rhe moral constraints exempl ified in rhe work of Tuke and Pinel Foucault d ifferentiates we have seen between confinement as a general marrer and rhe rise of rhe asylum However ir may well be rhar rhere is a more complex relationship between physical and mora l confinemenr rhan Foucault admirs This would nor derracr from his general claims abour reason and madness bur would require a more nuanced view of rhe relation of physical and men tal bonds rhan rhe one he has offered The mosr urgent issue is rhe fina l one First Foucault ofren privi leges France in his histories T his raises rhe question of how far one can generalize his conclusions beyond rhe French archive Midelfort refers to rhe work of psychiatrist and historian Klaus Doerner enrirled in rhe English rranslarion Madmen and the Bourgeoisie A Social History of Insanity and Psychiatry as a positive alternative ro Foucaulrs history of madness In rhar work Doerner divides his history into rhree parts dealing wirh England France and rhen Germany He finds both simi lari ties and differences among these countries bur discusses each on rhe basis of irs own experience Oddly although M idelfort sees Doerners work as an alternative to Foucaults Doerner himself does nor see ir rhar way He rakes issue wirh some of Foucaults interpretations largely becau se as he acknowledges his approach is more straightforwardly dialectica l rhan Foucaulrs bur he 42 ARCHAEOLOGICAL HISTORIES OF WHO WE ARE accepts many of Foucaults claims without reservation Moreover he refers to Foucaults book as the first important approach to a scientifi c sociology of psych iarry 11 Doerners praise notwithstanding the question of the relevance of Foucaults privileging of France for the experience of other countries is an important one It is a question that concerns more t han historical accuracy If as Foucault believes we are largely products o f a contingent history then we can look nowhere else than at the particularities of that history in order to understand who we have become Foucault knows this And to understand ourselves arigh t we must understand how far a historical portrait drawn from a particular place can be generalized We cannot appeal to some universal essence that lies within ourselves or our history in order to give an account of who we are in general and especially of who we are now There is nowhere else to turn bur to what has happened Of course how we understand what has happened our mode o f approach to ourselves and our history is also crucial Although this book is philosophical in orientation the question of general izabiliry as well as that of historical accuracy should always be with us We shall return to both in the discussion of the book on the prisons In addition to the question of how far Foucaults histories can be generalized across Europe there is also the quest ion of interna l diversiry Foucaults early histories those grouped in what is called his archaeo logical period have been read as positing themes that characterize an entire period In contrast to the later genealogical works wh ich focus more se lfconsciously on particular areas of experience his archaeologies are often understood as claiming that the themes he discusses rhe strucrurings he cites app ly nor only to the specific areas under srudy bur across an entire culture as well as across an entire continent Nor all of his interpreters embrace this view 12 bur it is a common one and Foucault admits later that it is a view that could easi ly be ascribed to his work It is nor difficult to see how such a view could arise in regard to the book on madness There he discusses reason as though it were a monolithic thing covering a large swath of who we are When reason changes we change Foucault does not say this He does not say that who we are is a matter of reason Nor does he say that reason is always the same across a particular culture at a particular rime However in the way that he focuses on reason in the way he situates his discussion relative to thinkers like Descartes in the way he creates a division between reason and irs Other  madness  he creates the impression that what holds for reason in the particulars in which he discusses it holds for other aspects of who we were and are 43 THE PHILOSOPHY OF FOUCAULT Words and things If Histoire de Ia folie leaves rhis impression The Order ofThings reinforces ir In rhar book Foucault introduces rhe concept of rhe episteme a concept rhar founds rhe books approach He defines his project rhis way what I am anempring ro bring ro light is rhe epistemological field rhe episteme in which knowledge envisaged a parr from all cri teria hav ing reference to irs rational value or ro irs objective forms grounds irs posiriviry and thereby manifests a history which is nor rhar of irs growing perfection bm rather rhar of irs conditions of possibility in this account what should appear are those configurations within rhe space of knowledge which have given rise to rhe diverse forms of empirical science   on the archaeological level we see rhar rhe system of posiriviries was transformed in a wholesale fashion ar rhe end of rhe eighteenth and beginning of rhe nineteenth cenmry OT xxi i This view of an episteme is we see ar once in keeping wirh rhe general methodological approach Foucault describes in The Archaeology of Knowledge published three years later Although rhe larrer book does nor use rhe rerm episteme rhe rerm archive plays a similar role In any case ar issue is looking ar rhe posiriviries of our knowledge nor by means of an account of rhe progress of knowledge bur rather by means of rhe srrucmrings rhar in a given historical period form irs conditions of possibility The issue is nor so much what is said or bener rhe rrmh of or evidence for what is said bur rather how what is said arises from what can be said or at least legirimarely said ar a particular rime and place Foucault sees rhis project as related to rhe book on madness bur also different in important ways The history of madness would be the history of rhe Orher of rhat which for a given culmre is ar once interior and foreign therefore to be excluded so as to exorcize rhe inrerior danger bm by being shm away in order ro reduce irs otherness whereas rhe history of rhe order imposed on things would be rhe his tory of rhe Same of rhar which for a given culmre is both dispersed and related therefore to be distinguished by kinds and to be collected rogerher inro idenriries OT xxiv There are ar least three things worth drawing attention to in this passage First rhe history of rhe Other he speaks of rhe archaeology of a silence is 44 ARCHAEOLOGICAL HISTORIES OF WHO WE ARE referred to contrary to Derridas interpretation from the side of reason It is how reason sees its Other not how the Other is in itself that the book on madness addresses Secondly and this is the main point of the passage whereas the book on madness defines reason by means of the foil it creates for itself the current book seeks to define something not by what it opposes but by what it is or by how it works That is why Foucault uses in this book and the methodological one the term posi tivity The structurings he discusses are not limits They do not stop knowledge or claims of knowledge from occurring They are posi tive srructurings they create the space in which knowledge happens Thirdly the passage speaks in a very general way about culture By invoking the concept of the episteme Foucault seems to indicate  and this passage reinforces it that he is addressing an epistemological structuring that operates across all forms of knowledge in a cu lture or at least all empirical sciences In The Archaeology of Knowledge he admits that this would be a reasonable interpretation of the text writing that in The Order of Things the absence of methodological signposts may have given the impression that my analyses were being conducred in terms of cu ltural totality AKDL 16 It is an interpretation that when the English translation appears in 1970 Foucaul t is at pains to distance himself from He writes in the preface to the English translation that the book was to be not an analysis of Classicism in general nor a search for a Weltanschauung worldview but a strictly regional  study OT x On the one hand in the original text it is difficu lt to see the various epistemes he discusses as something other than arch ival layers that stretch across the map of knowledge during particular periods On the other however aside from his general methodological claims he focuses his discussion on three specific areas of knowledge those that have more recently come to be cal led economics biology and linguistics He finds similar srrucrurings of knowledge running across these fields and moreover similar changes in srrucrurings during d ifferent rime periods As with the book on madness the discussion unfolds in three stages Foucault begins a little later with Renaissance though t then spends the central parr of the book on the classical period and finally ntrns towards more recent developments His treatment of the Renaissance does not distinguish the three fields that are to become his concern with the except ion of an account of language that he appends to rhe end of the discussion of the general episteme This also can contribu re to the idea that the srructurings he discusses later are relevant for other fields of knowledge aside from the three he focuses on Renaissance knowledge he finds can be summed up in the idea of resemblance There are re lations of resemblance among different elements and aspects of the universe The project of 45 THE PHilOSOPHY Of FOUCAULT knowledge is to d iscover those relations Th is project cannot be carried our through the use of empirical methods of discovery since resemblances are an invisible aspect of the cosmos that is woven into it rather than something one can discover through observation or experimentation To discover resemblances one needs to interpret the cosmos rather than to perceive it To get a grasp of how resemblance structures knowledge one can appeal to the example o f the microcosm and macrocosm The idea of microcosmic and macrocosmic resemblances stretches at least as far back as Plato In the Republic Plato offers what is one of the mosr lasting examples of their relation in the history of ph ilosophy Socrates is seeking to discover what justice in the soul is The chal lenge he confronts is that it might be difficult to see justice at the level of the soul it might be elusive or undetectable He offers his interlocutors the possibility of looking at something larger than the soul in order to be able to see justice more dearly Since we arent clever people we should adopt the method of investigation that wed use if lacking keen eyesight we were told to read small letters from a distance and then noticed that the same letters existed elsewhere in a larger size and on a larger surfaceu The larger object Socrates suggests is that of a ciry and so they design a just city in order to allow justice to appear more perspicuously The just ciry as it turns our is a harmony of three elements the merchants who work to make money the guardians who protect the city and the rulers drawn from among the guardians who rule the city This harmony is reflected in the soul The merchants are like the souls desires seeking satisfaction They form the appetitive parr of the soul The rulers are like the souls reason guiding the soul along irs proper paths That is the souls rational parr And the guard ians are rbe souls spiri t The spirit is that which if it is nor corrupted by the a ppetites aligns itself wi th the souls reason in order to keep one noble or honourable In this example there are several salient aspecls First the discovery o f justice as a harmony of parts o f the soul does nor arise through empirical research bur rather through an exercise of analogy It is nor observed it is instead recogn ized through a reflective enquiry Secondly the analogy works from the larger to the smaller and back again as though the cosmos is constructed so that cities and souls reflect each other There are invisible bonds of resemblance that suffuse the cosmos the project of knowledge is to understand them Finally although the brief summary here does nor show this the work of interpretation that this analogy requires does nor rely on anyth ing obvious that either the city or soul presents to Socrates or his fellow knowledge seekers T hat it was the three classes of the ciry 46 ARCHAEOLOGICAL HISTORIES OF WHO WE ARE that were the relevant factor in d iscovering justice is a maner of patient theoretical construction and subtle reasoning It does not presem itself as immediate or obvious Further finding their analogy in the soul requ ires more reflection and interpretation T he project of drawing om resemblances then is not a simple matter of seeing them It requires patiem imellecmal work The patience of this work becomes particularly evidem when one realizes that resemblances can occur in a variety of ways Foucault isolates four of them convenientia aemulatio analogy and sympathy Convenientia occurs through proximity the soul is proximate ro the body and so each is built ro resemble the other Aemulatio Foucault says is convenietia bm withom spatial proximity it is resemblance at a d istance Analogy allows for resemblances that occur by thematic likenesses between more disparate objects Sympathy is a freefloating resemblance that suffuses the cosmos These forms of resemblance form the framework within which the Renaissances epistemic project takes place In this framework language functions as a participam rather than as an external elemem The operation of language like other things is woven into the fabric of resemblances that constitute the universe It is a namral part of the cosmos The relation of languages to t he world is one of analogy rather than signification or rather their value as signs and their dupl icating function are superimposed they speak the heaven and the earth of which they are the image OT 37 The langu age that articu lates the world is also of the order of the world they are inseparable in the Renaissance episteme And when they do become separated when the working of language is no longer of a piece with the cosmos the Renaissance episteme has given way to the classical one If Renaissance knowledge can be summed up in the idea of resemblance then the classica l period receives its summation in the word order Order is a matter not of analogy bm of representation If we are to understand classical order we must approach it by way of language as a representing medium Representation begins when the re lation between the sign and what it signifies is no longer a namral one  In the sevemeenth and eighteemh cenntries the peculiar existence and anciem solidity of language as a thing inscribed in the fabric of the world were dissolved in the functioning of representation all language had value only as discourse ibid 43 There are objects on the one side and the signs that represent them on the other Their imernal bond is sundered In saying this however one must be careful It is not that language has withdrawn from its place in the universe to become something else something other Rather it is that the relation between signs and their signification has lost its status as a namral one For instance 47 THE PHILOSOPHY Of FOUCAULT Foucault says a sign can become an object for another sign a linguistic sign can become the object of a representation T he issue then is between signs and what they signify nor between language and the rest of the world We might say that the change is a matter of lingu istic operation rather than ontological status What is the relation between signifier and whar it signifies in the classical period The sign effaces itse lf before the object it signifies and in turn the object reveals itself without remainder in the sign The signifying element has no content no function and no determination other than what it represents it is entirely ordered upon and transparent to it Bur this content is indicated only in a representation that posits itself as such and that which it signifies resides without residuum and wi thout opacity with in the representation of the sign Ibid 64 The relation between sign ifier and signified is exhausted in the relation of representation T here is no longer as there was in the Renaissance a silent web of resemblance that would constitute the aerher in which signs and their objects are immersed And there is nor yer as there will be later a human consciousness that must be taken into account because of irs effect on the operation of language T here is no third thing the relation is a binary one It migh t seem here that representation does nor break the relationship between words and things There seems to be an internal bond After all if signs efface themselves before their objects is that nor because of some deep tie berween sign and object Does nor representation without remainder imply that there is a bond between signifier and sign ified Foucault is nor argu ing that there is no relation between a sign and irs object We are nor yet in more recent views of language that see language as a social phenomenon imposed on nature from without What no longer ex ists in the classical period is a web of resemblances in which language firs The internal bond that is lost is the aether of resemblance the cosmic play of convenientia aemulatio analogy and sympathy rhar binds all of existence together It is that bond that is broken wi th t he emergence of classical representation If the primitive source of knowledge is that of representations then the project of knowledge becomes that of ordering those representations We should think of the term order nor as an overarch ing Order in which everything has irs place bur rather as a project of ordering that is at the heart of classical knowledge Our signs are no longer texts with hidden meanings to be deciphered they are now representations that must be put in a proper 48 ARCHAEOLOGICAL HISTORIES OF WHO WE ARE order so rhar understanding can occur One starts w ith the simple ones and then bui lds more and more complex systems of representations Thus the idea of the table the table that gives the proper order to things becomes central ro the classical episteme The sciences carry within themselves the project however remote it may be of an exhaustive ordering of the world they are always directed roo toward the discovery of simple elements and their progressive combination and at their center they form a table on which knowledge is d isplayed in a system contemporary with itself Ibid 74 We must be clear here W hat Foucault is descrubing is nor the position taken by various sciences  especially those concerning livings beings money and value and grammar Order is nor what these sciences claim Nor is he characterizing what they see themselves as engaged in  Order is nor the project itself it is the framework the structuring of the project Virhin this structuring many debates rake place T he structure of order allows for opposition and cont radiction What it does nor allow for are claims and positions that cannot be fitted within the context of order It requ ires an ordering of representations into their proper tables To see the project of order at work consider the emergence of natural history Foucault points out that natural history is nor the same thing as biology T he latter is concerned with the concept of life the former with the concept of living beings Living beings need nor be brought under the sway of a single concept unless there is already a commitment to that concept underlying the episremic project Natural history does not have that concept W hat ir has is a project of ordering Ordering in contrast ro the episteme of the Renaissance starts with observation We observe a plenitude of living beings in the world There is no necessary hierarchy of order no Order rhar is presented ro us The project of ordering lies in utilizing observation so as to ach ieve order Language will be the lynchpin since representation allows objects to be given to us as they are Natural history has as a condition of irs possibiliry the common affinity of things and language wi th representation but it exists as a task only in so far as things and language happen ro be separate It must therefore reduce this distance between them so as to br ing language as close as possible to the observing gaze and the things observed as close as possible to words Natural history is nothing more than nomination of the visible Ibid  132 49 THE PHilOSOPHY Of FOUCAULT For narural history the visible is the privileged means of access to the observable It is the visible that can reduce the distance between things and their terms more than the other senses However this reduction is only the first step Nomination if it stays at the level of simple naming is nor enough There is representation bur nor yet order The nomination of natural history must create order among the d iversity of narure and the names that represent it Nomination must create a srrucrure It does so by means of four variables only the form of the elements the quantity of those elements the manner in which they are distributed in space in relation to each other and the relative magnitude of each element    For example when one srudi es the reproductive organs of a plant it is sufficient bur ind ispensable to enumerate the stamens and pisti l or to record their absence accord ing to the case to define the form they assume accord ing to what geometrical figure they are distributed in the flower circle hexagon triangle and what their size is in relation ro o ther organs Ibid 134 First then one starts with simple representations in this case the elements then one observes and records how those elements are combined in terms of quantity spatial relation and relative magn itude And our of these combinations one bui lds rabies T hose rabies show the place of each living being relative to its neighbours One creates a taxonomy In this sense one botanizes living beings As Foucault tells us The book becomes the herbarium of living structures ibid 135 How are these rabies created This is the subject of much debate within natural history during the classical period One approach would be to select what seem to be the central elements and arrange the taxonomy around them This of course can be accomplished in numerous ways depending on the elements one selects at the outset  Another approach would be to starr with an exhaustive description of a particular living being and then move to the next one listing only the differences between it and the first one and so on Here one does nor begin wirh a relatively arbitrary choice of privileged elements bur with an arbitrarily chosen living being T hese approaches are exclusive one cannot use both at the same rime However they are both projects framed by the ordering characteristic of the classical episteme In the course of bui lding a taxonomy language itself undergoes reflection  As things are brought into a systematic relation with one another so are the terms that represent them And because of this there is a close 50 ARCHAEOLOGICAL HISTORIES OF WHO WE ARE relationship between narural history and language perhaps closer in a sense than between narura l history and irs successor field  bio logy ie must therefore nor connect narural history as ir was manifested during the Classical period with a philosophy of life albeit an obscure and still faltering one In reality ir is interwoven with a theory of words   ir decomposes the language o f everyday life bur in order ro recompose ir and discover what has made ir possible   ir cri ticizes ir bur in order ro reveal irs foundation Ibid 161 Near rhe beginning of rhe nineteenth cenrury rlhe classical episteme undergoes an upheaval lr is one rhar wi ll induce episremic changes changes in rhe srrucrure of rhe archive rhar frames rhe investigations of narural history the theories of money and value and genera l grammar and perhaps the entirery of Western knowledge depending on how generally one reads rhe claims Foucault advances Narural history will become biology the theories of money and value will become economics and general grammar wi ll become linguistics The change rhar occurs might be characterized as rhe addition of a new depth or dimension to the world of knowledge To see this new dimension we can rurn ro rhe emergence of biology Biology unlike narural history is concerned with life lr is nor an investigation simply of living beings rhar are robe ordered bur of rhe organic nature rhar underlies them This new investigation was to be based on a principle alien to rhe domain of rhe visible  an internal principle nor reducible to rhe reciprocal interaction of represemarions This porinciple which corresponds to labor in rhe economic sphere is organic structure ibid  227 Li fe in biology labour in economics hidden grammatical structure in linguistics these are the new concepts around which the project of knowledge is to be undertaken lr is nor simply rhar new concepts however important have been added to rhe lexicon of rhe classical episteme These concepts do more than just broaden an episremic srrucrure that is already in pol ace Instead they form rhe pivot around which rhe entire srrucrure changes Once rhe depth of an underlying reality is brought into the framework of knowledge the goal of ordering and rhe assumption of representation are lost Ordering is lost because ir is in thrall to the visible One orders the visible one brings what can be seen and what can be said of what is seen closer together However the depth introduced by the nineteenth century is nor of the order of rhe visible bur rather that of an underlying srrucrure or narure To investigate that is nor merely ro add a dimension to ordering rather iris to abandon it 51 THE PHilOSOPHY O f FOUCAULT Representation is lost because of the assumption that words and things recall the French ririe of the book Les Mots et les chases no longer march up as cleanly as the classical age thought they did Now there are elusive depths and dimensions that undergird the visiblle and irs representation One can no longer count on the effacing of the sign before the object or the abil iry of the sign to render the object without remainder In fact it is precisely the remainder that is of interest This slackening of the bonds of representation corresponds to rwo spaces of depth one on the side of the sign or the observer the other on the side of the object For both human beings and the worlld they confront there is more to be understood than presen ted itself in t he classical period This more is nor that of the Renaissance with irs resemblances folded into the cosmos It is instead the more of an elusive depth that always lies beyond ones abil iry to grasp it conceptual ly Those who have studied Kant will recogn ize this dual depth Foucault characterizes It is the depth of the noumenon both on the side of the object to be known and the subject who acts In fact Foucault comments that the empirical studies of biology economics and linguistics are the other side of the same epistemic framework rhar harbours transcendental philosophy For the former the conditions of possibiliry of experience are being sought in the conditions of possibiliry of the object and irs existence whereas in transcendental reflection the conditions of the possibility of the objects of experience are identified with the conditions of possibiliry of experience itself The new posi tivity of the sciences of life language and economics is in correspondence with the founding of a transcendental phi losophy Ibid 244 Although as Foucault notes the character of t ranscendental philosophy will change radica lly in the new episteme from that of Kantian phi losophy the introduction of depth can be gl impsed in the example of his philosophy This new episteme which Foucault thinks we are near the end of at least arrhe rime of publication 1966 is characterized by a particular insrabil iry T he instabi lity can be grasped in the preceding quote There is an oscillation in this episteme between the empirical and the transcendental each forming although insufficiently the epistemic ground of the other Because of the hidden depth on both sides of rhe equation neither the empirical sciences nor transcendental ph ilosophy can complete their tasks of grounding their knowledge The empirical sciences cannot do this because the depth they seek is nor reducible to empirical methods they 52 ARCHAEOLOGICAL HISTORIES OF WHO WE ARE must appeal to transcendental phi losophy Alternatively transcendental ph ilosophy is a sefreflecrion on a self that always ultimately eludes the reflection There is more depth than can be grasped by reflectors themselves rhus there is a constant appeal outside transcendental philosophy ro the empirical sciences This oscillation appears in four gu ises The first Foucault calls the analyric of finitude The person engaged in reflection or investigation is finite in character and in knowledge As such finitude becomes both the object of investigation in the arising human sciences of b iology economics and linguistics and the limitation on knowledge of the investigation itself since it is a human being who is doing the investigating The second guise is the empiricotranscendental doublet in which human being man as Foucault calls it is at once the ground and object of investigation The third guise is the cogito and the unthought in which thinkers keep seeking the unthought grounding of their own thought which in turns recedes further toward the horizon as they pursue it Finally there is  rhe retreat and return of origin It is an endless search for an origin that must be there because it is founding but cannot be grasped precisely because it is founding it founds the search that is seeking it 14 The underlying commonal ity among these four g uises is a kind of depth that performs three roles at once First it is constitutive of our approach to the question of who we are Secondly it is the object of investigation Since representation can no longer be taken for granted one must delve into the depths of man in order to d iscover the origins or seek the ground of knowledge Finally it is that which always escapes the attempt to grasp it It is a depth that in the same gesture both constitutes who we are and eludes our understanding it What centres this episteme then is the idea Foucault calls man Man is nor the human biological entity Nor is he the creature with reason nor even Aristotles featherless biped Man is the privileged moment of the current episteme Man is at once the source and object of investigation the being in depth that creates the paradoxes inherent in the modern framework of knowledge Man is what seeks to know himself bur in order to do so must treat himself as at once the knower and the known and must constantly oscillate between the two Man is at once the subject and the object of knowledge This is of course an impossible task an endless one that can never be completed For as close as one gets to being known one must always recogn ize that it is oneself as knower  that is engaged in the knowing and therefore that there is still something left over to be known the parr that is doing the knowing It is like trying to see ones own eyes Kant refers to Home as the ph ilosopher who awakens him from his dogmatic slumber Foucault borrows that image saying that in the 53 THE PHILOSOPHY Of FOUCAULT modern episteme we are in the midst of an anthropological sleep a rype of dogmatic slumber that dreams only of man or better that dreams itself as man dreaming of man That sleep is characterized by the emergence of the human sciences the sciences of man and by man For Foucault then man is a recent invention OT 386 This does nor mean as some have misunderstood it that human beings are a recent invention or that we have only recently come to recognize human beings as something special with in nature or that we shall soon give way to another type of creature What is recent is man as the privi leged source and object of investigation Man had been a figure occurring between two modes of language or rather he was constituted only when language hav ing been situated within representation and as it were dissolved in ir freed itself from that situation at the cost of irs own fragmentation man composed his own figure in the interstices of rhar fragmented language Ibid Man the being of depth that arises when representation no longer captures the relation of words and things is a historical ent ity And like all historical entities man will pass and something new will arise Not human beings man in the very particular sense that it has arisen in the current episteme Foucaul t concludes The Order oThings with the oracular bur ultimately historical claim that if the current episteme begins ro lose irs grip on us then man would be erased li ke a face drawn in sand at the edge of the sea ibid 397 We should nor rake this pronouncement as a prediction of some kind of onto logical fall of human beings or their dissolution into some other world Rather we should rake it as offering the possibility that just as knowledge was once arranged in such a way that man as the privileged figure of depth does nor occur so it can be arranged that way again In the three epistemes Foucault investigates the posi tion of man as at once subject and object of knowledge arises in only one There is no reason nor ro believe that this episteme like previous ones will pass and with irs passing will also pass man The OrderoThings like Histoire de Ia folie is a book about who we are about who we rake ourselves to be And in that sense it is at the same rime a book about who we are nor Vhat the book accompl ishes is to rake a view of who we are the view given through the recent ly arising human sciences and specifically biology linguistics and economics and to show that that view is historically situated The human sciences do nor tell us who we are or better they do not tell us who we are in a way that is absolute and unsurpassable Rather they are investigations into who we are that are 54 ARCHAEOLOGICAL HISTORIES OF WHO WE ARE situated within a certain way of approaching us a certain episterne and irs specific orientation T his does nor mean that we are not what the human sciences tell us we are To claim that wou ld require a birdseye view of who we are Bur if Foucault is right about the existence of epistemes there is no birdseye view from which to pass such a judgement Rather his claim is that we do nor have to rake ourselves as being what the human sciences tell us we are There are other ways for us to see ourselves indeed there have already been other ways The Order ofThings then is a book about who we are in a very specific sense It is a book about the historical character of who we rake ourselves to be Although like Histoire de Ia folie this book concerns the question of who we are it approaches irs subject marrer differently from the earl ier book As Foucault notes rather than seeing us from the viewpoint of our exclusion of the Other it seeks to articu late the structure of the Same It tries to describe the historically situated frameworks in which we have appeared to ourselves as living speaking exchanging beings There is another difference as well Although the book on madness is concerned nor only with the discourse on madness bur also wi th the knowledge of madness The Order of Things focuses exclusively on knowledge Histoire de Ia folie spends much of irs rime on theories o f madness and of particular types of madness Bur it also discusses the treatment of the mad the practices through which the mad were engaged manipulated confined and observed The Order of Things is solely concerned with knowledge in irs theoretical aspect Nevertheless both are concerned with the question of who we are and especially with that questi on as it arises in our historically situated knowledge of ourselves Earlier we isolated five elements that are characteristic of Foucaults approach to the question of who we are Foucault sees our determination as collective as one that we cannot just shake off as complex as involving both acting and knowing and as historically contingent We can see three of these elements clearly in play in both of the books we have recounted That Histoire de Ia folie and The Order of Things see our determination as co llective historically contingent and one we cannot just shake off is straightforward The collective character of our determination arises from Foucaults account being historical rather than individual He focuses on the way we see things or have seen them  and the way we act In contrast for instance to Sarrres early work he does nor account for who we are by looking at the individual bur rather at the framework of our collective viewpoints The archaeological method displays the historical contingency of our being who we are Foucaults refusal to account for how epistemes change reflects as we saw a eeriness about progressive views of history By allow55 THE PHilOSOPHY O f FOUCAULT ing historical breaks or disconrinuiries inro his narratives he rejects the idea rhar each episteme is a necessary improvemenr on the previous one Bur in such a rejection there is also a commirmenr ro historical contingency Since later frameworks do nor necessarily stem from earlier ones rhe order of historical frameworks is nor pregiven There is no particular reason why represenrarion had ro follow resemblance or why the mad had ro be liberated from physical bondage in order ro suffer moral bondage in rhe lateeighteenth cenrury Foucault does nor deny rhac earlier events can cause later ones However he does nor seek to account for that causal icy wh ich implies rhar he does nor see a parrern rhar governs historical change Historical change is then conringenr That we can nor just shake off the historical frameworks in which we find ourselves is nor something Foucault argues for explicitly Rather ir follows from his approach He is at pains for instance ro show rhar Tuke and Pinel do nor initiate a new epoch in the rrearmenr of the mad bur instead reflect larger changes rhar borh precede and accompany their work Foucault does nor argue rhar nothing can be done ro change h istorical frameworks in facr they do change Bur he does nor see rhose changes as being wrought simply by ind ividual ini tiati ve One migh t wanr to argue here that since he does nor account for historical breaks he must rlhink rhar nobody has any ability ro conrribure ro historical change We are all simply prisoners of our own epistemes That would be raking Foucaults reticence ro account for change roo far Foucault is agnostic abour our relation ro historical change nor atheistic To say rhar we cannot simply shake off our h isroical heritage is nor ro say that we can have no effect on it Can we as individuals or in a co llective manner create historical change Foucault does nor tell us his views on this His reluctance ro discuss how people affect rhe historical trajectories he recounts has led many people ro think that he is a fatal ist This charge has followed nor only his archaeo logical works bur his later genealogical ones as well In the larrer case the accusation is more stinging because as we shall see the genealogical works are more pol itically charged T heir stakes concern who we are as a product of relations of power and specifically relarions of power and knowledge W hen power is ar stake the claim that we can do nothing about it seems more despairing or even cynical However rhere seems robe no reason nor ro rake Foucaults histories ro be anything other than what he often says they are rools to be used to understand our situation He does nor give us ontological accounts of who we are and he is nor seeking to answer questions about free will and determinism The freedom he accords us comes nor from w ithin rhe deep structure of human beings bur from wi thin rhe fragi le and conringent nature of our history Therefore he does nor see himself as owing us a general account of 56 ARCHAEOLOGICAL HISTORIES OF WHO WE ARE the ways people can or cannot affect their historical siruarion bm instead an accoum of the situation itself There are rwo qual ities we have nor discussed yet the fact that who we are is a maHer of both acting and knowing and the complexity of who we are As ro the first it appears most clearly in the book on madness The Order of Things is a more theoretically focused work Foucault does nor discuss there the use of the human sciences in nontheoretical simarions although he recognizes rhar there is an imeracrion between theory and practice In the Archaeology of Knowledge for instance he writes rhar the determination of the theoretical choices rhar were acmally made is also dependem on another amhoriry This aurhoriry is characterized first by the function rhar the discourse under smdy must carry om in a field of nondiscursive practices Thus General Grammar played a role in pedagogic practice    AKDL 678 Even in that work however he privileges the discurs ive level as ev idenced by the terms archive discursive formarion and statenlent that govern the methodological structure he erects W hen he moves to his later genealogica l works Foucault will articu late a deeper imeracrion between the discourse of the human sciences and their practice and appl ication At this stage of his investigation Foucault is more imeresred at the discursive level than at the level of practice although pract ice does appear in the book on madness wi th regard to the rrearmem of the mad and it appears as well in The Birth of the Clinic which describes the r ise of clinical medicine and the views of life and death that arise in irs wake The issue of complexity is itself a complex one h depends in parr on ones view of the srams of archaeo logy Ye have seen that Foucault is unclear at this stage in his writings abom the range of appl ication of his analyses Is the relation of reason ro madness in Histoire de Ia folie a marrer all of reason Does the reason rhar rakes pacricular forms in relation to irs Other characterize the enrire srrucrure of reason in a given period If there is no such thing as an ah istorical Reason is there such a thing as a historically simated Reason We might ask the same questions abom epistemes about the extenr of their reach in particular historical periods Sometimes Foucault characterizes them as structures rhar lie beneath emire cu lm raJ formations At other rimes he denies this In The Archaeology of Knowledge for instance he writes rhar The relations I have described are valid in order to define a particular configuration they are nor signs to describe the face of a cu lmre in irs totality ibid 159 When we turn to Foucaults genealogical works we shall see a more clearly demarcated set 57 THE PHilOSOPHY Of FOUCAULT of limitations on his ana lyses At the archaeological stage ir is unclear whether the archaeological layers he uncovers are meanr to characterize a smaller or larger parr of the terrain he is investigating In viewing the last rwo characteristics of Foucaults work we have seen rwo sets of questions arise The first concerns the relations between the discursive and the nondiscursive Although Foucault claims at rimes to be investigating both the archaeo logical works place their accenr on what is said at the expense of what is done Is there a separable relation berween the rwo or is it rather that in order to understand one requires at the same rime an investigation of the other To understand what is said or what can be said does there nor have to be an investigation of the doings in which those sayings are caught up wh ich frame them and confer their legitimacy or illegitimacy Alrernarively does the relation between the rwo nor also flow in the other direction where certain say ings create or prevent or transmute the doings they come inro conracr with Perhaps it would be best ro drop the distinction between the rwo altogether and to invest igate the practices in which both arise simultaneously The other set of questions concerns the status of the archives Foucault describes their specificity and their general ity Archaeology which works across a particular chronological stratum seems ro imply a commonal ity among d iscourses in a given historical period both within a culture and across cu ltures Is Foucault committed to this Should we fo llow the lead of the works themselves wh ich seem more expansive in this regard Or should we instead rarify some of the commenrs he makes abour the works often afterwards wh ich point to a more limited scope Foucault himself seems to struggle with this problem There is a third set of questions as well one that relates to the status of the works themselves In The Archaeology of Knowledge Foucaul t tells us consistenT with the approach of his wri tings that it is nor possible for us to describe our own archive since it is from w ithin these ru les that we speak since it is that which gives us what we can say AKDL 130 This staremenr raises rwo questions one having ro do with the sratemenr itself and the other with irs implication for his histories As far as the statement itself goes there is a problem of what is known philosophically as reflexivity If it is nor possible for us to describe our own archive how does he know that we speak within irs rules To know that wou ld seem to imply that we can step outside our own archive at leasiT far enough to recognize rhar it has a particular set of ru les Bur that is precisely what Foucault says cannot be done To say that one cannot describe ones own arch ive is a bit like saying I always lie There is something selfdefeating abour ir since it assumes a srandpoinr that the sraremenr itself denies It seems that the best Foucault can do in this area is plead ignorance abour the archival 58 ARCHAEOLOGICAL HISTORIES OF WHO WE ARE nature of his own discourse His arrempt to simate us historically within an archive is selfrefuting The implication for his histories is this If we are speaking from within our own archive and if its ru les and norms are as ungrounded and as changeable as say that of the classical or the modern episteme what does that mean for the status of his historical narratives Should we take them as accurate depictions of the frameworks of knowledge that operate in the periods he describes Or should we instead and perhaps more consisten tly see them simply as descriptions that come from a particular archive no worse and no berrer than competing descriptions that could be offered from the perspective of different archives Foucault concludes The Archaeology of Knowledge with a wrirren selfinterv iew It is an honest piece of selfreflection during which he asks himself XIhat then is the t itle of you r discourse Where does it come from and from where does it derive its right to speak How could it be legitimated He responds thus  admit that this quest ion embarrasses me more than your earl ier objections    my discourse far from determining the locus in which it speaks is avoiding the ground on which it could find support ibid 205 The question of the status o f Foucaults archaeological writings is one that he never resolves It rema ins alongside the issue of the relation of the d iscursive and the nondiscursive and the question of the general scope of the archaeologies among the challenges facing Foucaults archaeological project He does not adequately answer them because he moves on to another project or at least modifies the project enough to give it another name Genealogy rep laces archaeology Should we reproach him for this Does he owe us an account of the success or failure of archaeology to address these questions He does not think so When he confronts himself at the outset of The Archaeology of Know ledge with the charge that he keeps changing the character of what he is doing he responds to himself by saying Do not ask who I am and do not ask me to remain the same leave it to our bureaucrats and our pol ice to see that our papers are in order ibid 17 This is I believe the right response Not because one should never answer for anyth ing one wri tes Bur because one need not answer for everything one writes every aspect of ones perspective Sometimes it is enough just to move on Many philosophers spend the early part of their careers staking our a small piece of philosophical territory and the rest of their professional lives patro lling that territory rather than investigating what else might be our there It is for all bur very few phi losophers  those who can mine a particular problem more deeply with each investigation always finding a hidden seam with new riches  a sad and futile exercise Foucault does not do this He moves on His archaeologies are a rype of invest igation his 59 THE PHILOSOPHY Of FOUCAULT genealogies anorher If Foucaulr does nor offer us rhe model of phi losophical consistency if he changes direction several rimes over rhe course of his career and if he loses or gains readers in rhe process perhaps we should nor faulr him for rhis Perhaps we should see his works as he sees rhem invesrigarions enquiries inro who we are and how we gor robe rhar way And if we find a particular enquiry ro be unhelpfu l  because ir is unenlighrening misraken unclear or for some orher reason  we roo can jusr move on find something more helpfu l more exciring more challenging The srakes afrer all concern who we are and who we mighr be To misrake rhese srakes for something less would be ro lose rhe rhread nor only of Foucaults larger enrerprise bur of our own 60 CHAPTER THREE Genealogical histories of who we are In May and June of 1968 events in Paris and elsewhere  events that have both d iscursive and nondiscursive aspects  alter the character of French life They also alter the character of French thought To recount these events in anything like the complexity they deserve is beyond the scope of this book Moreover any approach to the events of May or  May 68 invites controversy No period in French history s ince the Second World Var has generated as much discussion as these two months in the late 1960s Are the events revo lutionary or are they just the indulgence of middleclass students Have they had a longlasting impact on French culture or po litics or are their effects loca lized to a time and place Do they contribute to the rise of an independent French approach to the world or simply stall its economic development Are the events primarily a cu ltural phenomenon or do they rise or descend to the level of politics One cannot interpret the events without becoming implicitl y or exp licitl y com mined on these and other quest ions 1 Let us be brief In May 1968 students at the university at Namerre go on strike to protest their administrations temporary closing of the university in the wake of demands for antiimperialist study T hese strikes are soon followed by workers strikes and intersection of these st rikes brings together at least temporari ly rwo sections of the French population that are traditionally separate from each other In Paris barricades are built in the st reets and it looks for a br ief period as though President de Gaulles government might fall  It would be the first revolution in modern Western Europe succeeding where the revolts of 1848 and 1871 fai l T he French Communist Parry rakes a stand against the students and workers largely because it is caught unawares by the events and does nor find itself in the vanguard where it considers irs rightful place to be By mid to late June civic order is restored The character of many French citizens sense of themselves however is transformed as is the landscape of French intellectual life 61 THE PHILOSOPHY Of FOUCAULT Up until the events of May the French political scene could be nearly divided into the communists on the left and the lilberals on the right There are of course gradations in between bur the primary battleground concerns these rwo ideologies One is either with Sarrre the communist or Raymond Aron the liberal The events do nor change the libera l side If anything they reinforce the liberal view of the irresponsibiliry of rad icalism On the left however everyth ing changes The political bankruptcy of the French Communist Parry which had aligned itself with the rightist de Gaulle is there for al l to see No longer would communism in France be the hope of the left Or more accurately no longer would the communism of the French Communist Parry or any other party claiming to speak for the masses be the lefts hope The Parry betrays the workers It does nor lead them in the moment of transformation It does nor even follow it resists from the righ t in the name of its own leadership T he left will have to look elsewhere for its models This change does nor involve a sh ift from one set of allegiances to another There is at this rime no other systematic competing set of ideas to embrace Parry communism does nor have an alternative And yet this as it turns our is the good news The intellectual culture in France in the decade or so after May 68 particularly in irs po litical thought is among the most fru itful in recent history There is an explosion of po litical or politically relevant thought from a number of angles that comes to occupy the place vacated by the French Communist Parry Nor only Foucault but also G illes Deleuze JeanFranois Lyotard Luce lrigaray Jacques Derrida Ju lia Krisreva Alain Badiou Jacques Ranciere and others provide political reflection or politically charged phi losophical reflection that points in new directions and offers new ways to conceive our relations m the world and to one another T imes of crisis when the old order comes unglued and the new one has not yet coalesced can act as a spur ro creativiry Think of the Renaissance for instance The postMay period in French intellectual culmre is one of those times Foucaul t is not in Paris during the events of May He is teaching instead at the Universiry of Tunis in Tunisia However soon after the events of May he returns to France to head the ph ilosophy department at Vincennes a gathering some would call it a ghetto of the French intellectual left After the publication of The Archaeology of Knowledge he does not publish a book for seven years H is shorter writings and activity though take on an increasingly pol itical tinge This tinge is in evidence in the inaugural address of his appointment to Frances most prestigious insti tution of higher learning the College de France T here he discusses the will to truth as a power imposed to limit discourse and prevent creative thought and he announces his future research programme It comprises two aspects 62 GENEALOGICAl HISTORIES OF WHO WE ARE The first is a critical one that isolates the forms of exclusion limitation and appropriation of discourse AKDL 231 The second is a genealogical one that shows how series of discourse are formed through in spi re of or with the aid of these systems of constraint whar were the specific norms for each and what were their conditions of appearance growth and variat ion ibid 232 The second project is the one that Foucault eventually embraces And in embracing it he sh ifts his focus from the more pure ly discursive to incorporate the nondiscursive as wel l He describes the rise and the effects especially political effects of various practices and their intersection And as he mentions in his inaugural address he gives this historical description the name genealogy What is genealogy Most of us are probably most familiar with the term in its appl ication to familial lineage To trace a family genealogy is to trace ones ancestors to fo llow backwards or forwards the marriage and kinsh ip lines that yield oneself ones siblings ones c hi ldren  There is something of this going on in Foucaults genealogies The idea of asking who one is by way of tracing how one has arrived at this point is certain ly in accordance with his method In addi tion as we shall see just as the roots of a fami ly genealogy become more dispersed the further back or the further forward one goes Foucaults genealogies do not found themselves at a particular privi leged starring point TI1ere is no pristine moment of origin no point of creation Everything begins dispersed without centre or unity However there are important differences as well First instead of t racing the evolution of marriages Foucault traces the evolution of practices Secondly and fo llowing directly from this the question of who one is becomes as it is in the archaeo logical works a collective question rather than an ind ividual one The product of a Foucauldian genealogy is not an I it is a we Thirdly in as much as fami lial genealogies seek to give a single answer to the question of who one is and of course they need not do so Foucault breaks with that approach Un like a fam ily genealogy of which there can only be one genealogies of practices are many and various Ve are involved in many different practices and although particular ones may be more importantly determinative for who we a re no single one or no single group has a privi leged position one that guides the others or to which the others can be reduced Fourthly Foucaults genealogies are tied to the politics of truth It is not simply practices that Foucault is interested in it is the politics and epistemology of those practices and especially the bond between their politics and their epistemology The term genealogy is one that Foucault borrows from N ierzsche Nietzsche uses it to describe the emergence of what he thinks of as force 63 THE PHILOSOPHY Of FOUCAULT relat ions in regard to particular institutions or practices These forces are broadly speaking active and reactive ones Active forces are at once creative and dest ructive if they are destructive though it is as a byproduct of their creativity Active forces seek to express themselves whether by artistic or martial or athletic or other means Reactive forces by contrast do not seek to express themselves They are as their name impl ies forces that react to active ones Essentially reactive forces are those that are unable to express themselves as active forces do so their form of expression is parasitical upon that of active ones T hat form of expression is largely negative they seek to undermine the expression of active forces For Nietzsche then reactive forces are in a close alignment with resentment with a hatred for the expression characteristic of acti  e forces The question for Nietzsche is given a particular institution or practice what is currently dominating it active or reactive forces This is where genealogy comes in  Genealogy is the tracing of the history of an institution or a practice by asking which forces have taken hold of it active or reactive ones One cannot project back from ones current position the meaning or origin of an institution or practice History is in Nietzsches eyes the struggle for dominance among and between active and reactive forces He points out in On the Genealogy of Morals that everyth ing which happens in the organic world is part of a process of overpowering mastering and that in turn all overpowering and mastering is a reinterpretatlion a manipulation in the course of which the previous meaning and aim 1nust necessarily be obscured or completely effaced This approach has several elements that find their way into Foucaults own genealogies First  genealogy does not search for an origin a wellspring from which the practices one is investigating can be understood in their essence For some who seek to understand particular practices the key is to dig beneath all the historical transformations in order to discover the original character of the practice Martin Heidegger for instance holds that in order to understand the quest ion of Being we need to go back to its original asking before it was buried under the Weight of the metaphysical tradition Genealogy rejects this approach Of course all practices begin somehow However their beginning does not give us any privi leged insight into their essential character The reason for this and this is the second element Foucault adopts is that there is no essential character that practices contain For Nietzsche as for Foucault what counts is not essence but historical legacy To discover the character of a practice is to trace the roles it plays the intersections with 64 GENEALOGICAl HISTORIES OF WHO WE ARE other practices it maintains the meanings ascribed to it and that emerge from ir over the course of irs evolution Foucaul t departs from Nietzsche in Nietzsches attempt ro interpret this evolution in terms of active and react ive forces For Foucault there are no forces that form a framework for interpretation However the difference here amounts to less than it might seem In Foucaults genealogical writings as in N ietzsches there is a st rong normative flavour Foucault at rimes characterizes his works as description rather than recommendation bur this is a bit disingenuous As we shall see Foucault is clearly critical of the penal project of rehabilitation as he is of the interpretative projects that have come to surround our sexual ity Nietzsche uses valueladen terms  active and react ive  in his genealogical studies They form the normative framework of his approach If Foucault does nor have an overt normative framework he certainly knows what he doesnt li ke what he finds in the term he sometimes uses intolerable This is the third element he borrows from Nietzsche Those familiar wi th Nietzsches and Foucaults writings might wish to object here that although their genealogies are both normatively laden there is a very different set of norms to which each is attached After all Nietzsches view is aristocratic He has no use as he repeated ly insists for anything democratic For him it is the strong and the creative that are worthy he is nor concerned with the oppressed Foucault on the other hand never ceases to speak alongside although never in the name of the oppressed Vherher it is the mad prisoners homosexuals or outcasts he embraces those who find themselves in positions of weakness rather than strength There is something to this objection Nietzsche indeed is no democrat  However it would be easy to make roo much of this difference for two reasons First Nietzsches active forces are themselves in danger of becoming outcasts The mass of humanity for which to be sure he d isplays no sympathy  always seek to destroy or at least to margina lize active forces This is why he says the strongest and most fortunate are weak when opposed by organized herd instincts by the timid ity o f the weak by the vast majority   Strange though it may sound one always has to defend the strong against the weak Secondly there is an important similarity between the objects of Nietzsches and of Foucaults criticism They both target the mind less conformism that characterizes contemporary society For Nietzsche that conformism is a product of the dominance of reactive forces for Foucault it has more to do with historically grounded realities such as the emergence of capitalism and the evoluiion of church doctrine However both share a revulsion against conformiry that characterizes the world each of them lives in 65 THE PHilOSOPHY OF FOUCAULT The debt that Foucault owes ro Nierzsche in adopting the genealogical approach becomes clear in an essay he publishes in 1971 a year after his inaugural lecture at the College de France and four years before the appearance of his first fulllength genealogy Discipline and Punish T he essay entitled Nietzsche Genealogy History is at once a rendering of Nietzsches genealogical method and an announcement of his own It begins with the lines Genealogy is gray meticulous and patiently documentary It operates on a field of entangled and confused parchments on documents that have been scratched over and recopied many rimes NGH 139 These words are perhaps a better characterization of Foucaults more derai led approach than Nietzsches method of painting with broad brush stro kes bur it does emphasize the historical character of both projects The similarity deepens as the essay unfolds After a critique of histories that rely on the concept of origins and grand beginnings Foucault notes that Nierzsches genealogical method is engaged in a twofold task Herkzmft and Entstehung or in rhe English translation descent and emergence Together they constitute a historical approach that abandons the ideas of history as having particular aims or goals as being a unified goal wi th a decipherable meaning and as having an essential origin that has made us who we are or alternatively from which we have strayed Descent approaches history by means of seeking the separate dispersed events that have come together in a contingent way to form a particular practice Rather than looking for the golden threads that bind history together descent seeks the comingrobe of a practice in events that are often small ignored close to the ground and disparate from one another Emergence on the other hand describes the hazardous play of dominations ibid 148 that forms the history of a given practice or group of practices Emergence in Nietzsches view is a matter of the domination of active and reactive forces Rather than seeking the meaning o f a practice in the goals it sets itself or the ro le it sees itself as fu lfi lling Nietzsche asks whether a practice is oriented towards creation and expression or instead toward resentment and smallmindedness Bur emergence can be seen and Foucault will see it this way as a matter of what effects deleterious or helpful the uses to which practices are pur give rise at different rimes and places Together descent and emergence offer a view of history that traces the emergence and dissolution of practices and of the uniti es those practices temporarily form with other practices It is a history without origin goal or meaning It is a history in which disparate practices come together and then disperse in unpredictable ways and it is a history in which this coming together and dispersing produce a number of unforeseen effects that can resu lt in a variety of dominations T his does nor imply however that recounting this history is po intless After all human beings are without 66 GENEALOGICAl HISTORIES OF WHO WE ARE origin goal or meaning Genealogy then is a project of tell ing us about who we are Ir tells us without reference to the framing assumptions of much of the history of philosophy And in doing so it tells us two other things as wel l It allows us to see how aspects of ourselves that we thought were natura l or inescapable turn our instead robe historical and in fact historically contingent We did nor have to become who we are and in rurn we can become somethi ng other than what we are It also allows us to see some of the effects of being who we are now effects that perhaps we would rather nor be parry to There is no single story of who we are that Foucault has to tell His genealogies do nor seek to cover the broad sweep of our historical legacy More clearly and more consciously than in his archaeo logical works Foucault rakes his genealogies ro trace aspects of who we have come robe of who we are now If our history is a matter of the unfolding of temporary un ities from dispersed origins then who we are is a matter nor of any part icular unity bur of a variety of overlapping and intersecting un ities of pract ices Although at rimes Foucault uses images that suggest he is describing an entire cultural formation a close reading of his genealogical works shows that those images are rhetorical more than substantive In each case Foucault describes an important parr of who we are and how we came to be that way In no case does he rake himself as accounting for all of ir The writer John Berger observes Never again will a single story be told as though it were the only one 5 It is an observation that Foucaults writings embody There are rwo major works of Foucaults rhar fall clearly under the category of genealogy the book on the punishment enti tled Discipline and Punish and the first volume of The History of Se1rality Of these only the first is a fu llfledged historical study The latter is both methodological and programmatic It offers a clear delineation of the method that was used in the prison book and is to be used in a larger srudy o f sexual ity and it offers a brief historical framework for the genea logical study of sexual ity The latter project for reasons we shall discuss more fully below is never completed Instead Foucault turns from his proposed study of sexual ity to the larger project of selfmaking and at the same rime widens the historical scope of his study He starts with the Greeks rather than as is his wont the Renaissance or early postRenaissance A history of the prisons Discipline and Punish displays an important similarity ro Foucaults book on madness In both as wi ll also be the case with rlhe book on sexuality he 67 THE PHilOSOPHY O f FOUCAULT performs what we might cal l an inversion of a received view In Histoire de Ia folie the inversion rakes place with regard to the work ofTuke and Pinel On the received view both are thought to be liberators of the mad unchaining them and releasing them from their barbarous conditions Foucault argues that although this may be true there is an opposite movement as well a rechaining of the mad Released from their physical bonds the mad will now be bound by moral bonds that are as sure as if nor more sure than the physical bondage to which they were previously subject We must be carefu l here nor to misunderstand the inversion Foucault performs He does not argue although the view has been ascribed ro him that things were better in earl ier periods and ave now become worse Nierzsches work often suggests this type of historical decline or regression It is nor Foucaults position The inversion he performs is nor a simple one in which we are to ld that things have become berrer when in fact they have become worse To deny the assumption of a progressive history does nor require rhar one embrace the assumption of a regressive history The inversion Foucaults studies perform seeks to show that what has been called a progressive history moment is accompanied by a movement that is also deleterious This does nor reverse the assumption of historical progress ir complicates ir What is the story of historical progress that Fou cault reverses in his book on punishment and the prisons It is a story we are all fami liar with even if we have no background in penal study It is a story of penal progress from vengeance to rehabilitation In the early history of punishment punishment rakes the form of ret ribution The offender is treated as something beneath or beyond human concern Hav ing committed a crime the offender is subject to any form of punishment the social body deems appropriate to mere our Torture physical and psychological abuse public humiliation these are all among the range of punishments available to a society that wants on ly to get back at criminals for the wrongs they have committed It is probably worth noting that this sentiment which was once thought obsolete can be seen on full display in the United Stares before the implementation of a death penalry It is inscribed on the placards and etched in the faces of those who stand outside the prisons anticipating the execution T here are fewer reminders of how little distance we have travelled from the rime of public tormre more powerful than those gatherings In any case so the story goes we have death penalty celebrations notwithstanding become more civi lized Rehabilitation has replaced torture and public punishment as the preferred response ro crime Rather than simply punishing criminals for what they have done we now seek to change them make them into something that can navigate society in a different 68 GENEALOGICAL HISTORIES OF WHO WE ARE way Crime on rhis view is nor simply an acr rhar requires vengeance ir is a behaviour rhar requires inrervenrion The criminal is nor simply ro be punished for commirring an acr Once rhe criminaO is in rhe custody of rhe srare rhe proper approach is ro work on rhe criminal so as ro promote a differenr sryle of engaging with the world a differenr behavioural repertoire Wherher by instilling proper work habits or offering insigh t inro the causes of rhe aberranr behaviour or breaking individuals down bootcamp style and rebu ilding rhem or reinforcing good habirs while seeking to extinguish bad ones or by some combination of these criminals are not simply to be harmed They are robe improved In this way the rreatmenr of criminals has become more humane It is no longer a ceremony of degradation or abuse Rather ir is a policy of improvemenr Criminals no longer fall ourside the realm of human concern X7hile punishmenT of some form is in order rhe criminal is at the same rime to be treated as someone who was once and wil l again be a member of society Penal inrervenrion musr be constructed wirh rhar recognition in mind This is rhe progressive story of penal history The first few pages of Discipline and Punish do lirde ro undermine thar srory Foucault recounts rhe public rorrure of an artempred regicide named Damiens that rakes place in 1757 The spectacle is gruesome Ir involves burning and peeling skin from rhe offender drawing and quartering slicing limbs all in an order rhar would seek to cause rhe maximum amount of pain This account is immediately followed by one rhar could not provide a greater contrast Ir is a prison schedule from eighty years later Ir describes in a detached fashion rhe mundane rourine robe followed by rhe inmates of a prison for yourhfu l offenders offering a rigorous minurely derailed accounr of whar is robe expected of rhem ar each hour of rhe day It is easy to see here rhe received view of penal history ar work rhe contrast between rhe public rorrure and humi liation during rhe procedure Damiens often called our for Gods pity of rhe procedure applied to rhe regicide and rhe regimenrarion of rhe penal practice rhar fol lows ir The first is an exercise in vengeance rhe second an exercise in rehabilitat ion Foucaults placing of these rwo approaches side by side shows rhar he recognizes that there is somerhing to rhe received view Bur ir is also misleading Thar is where rhe genealogical history begins Foucaults history does nor as his recitation of the case of Damiens exempl ifies rake issue wirh rhe early parr of rhe received view Criminals are tortured and degraded before rhe reforms of rhe lareeighreenrh and earlynineteenth centuries In facr rorrure occurs ar rwo points in rhe criminal procedure one secretly and rhe other publicly The first point is dur ing inrerrogarion In order ro obtain confessions pain is infl icted on rhesuspeers body This may ring false ro modern ears where a person is presumed 69 THE PHILOSOPHY Of FOUCAULT innocent until proved gui lty Recall though rhar former President Ronald Reagans Anorney General Edwin Meese once defended rhe denial of righ ts ro suspects by saying rhar if rhey werent guilty rhey wouldnt be suspeers However during rhe classical period gu ilt occurs by degrees Tlms a semiproof did nor leave rhe suspect innocem umi l such rime as ir was completed ir made him semigu ilty slight evid ence of a serious crime marked someone as sl ightly criminal DP 42 A suspect rhen is always deserving of rorrure It is during punishmem rhar rhe criminals bod y is subject ro pain and becomes public In France rhe procedure is called supplice which translates imo Engl ish as torture However we should nor rhink of supplice as a simple barbarity performed upon rhe body of rhe criminal Supplice is nor chaoric or arbitrary lr is a measured and calculated response ro criminality one rhar has rhree elemems rhe infliction of a measured amoum of pain rhe regulation of rhar pain and rhe rirualisric character of rhe application of techniques producing pain Suppice is a righrly choreographed public rima of agony and ir finds irs sear in rhe narure of criminality itself Criminal ity is often rhoughr of among other ways as an offence against rhe social body This is as rrue of earlier periods as iris now However rhe character of rhe social body in for instance preRevolmion France is differenr lr is nor rhe people bur rhe sovereign rhe king who is considered the bearer of rhe elemems of the social body Whereas in democratic regimes ar least in principle rhe people are thought to be the constiruems of rhe social body in earlier monarchies rhe king plays thar role lr is nor as though there are no people bur rather rhe character of the people is rhoughr ro be distilled in rhe body of rhe sovereign The French  cest moi Thus an arrack on rhe social body is an arrack on rhe king and in a very li tera l way Criminality is an arrack on the social body on the body of rhe king It is a personal arrack an injury anempred against rhe regal body In order ro reestablish the sovereignty of rhe regal body rhe social body rhar has been arracked one must restore rhe balance of power Here we shall use the term power in a traditional sense lr is a rerm as we shall see rhat Foucault complicates larer in rh is work Or bener one musr resrore rhe proper imbalance of power If rhe criminal can ger away wirh an arrack this proves rhe weakness rhe vulnerability of rhe social body The punishmenr of a crime then musr involve an assertion of rhe power of the sovereign Criminals musr be made ro feel rhar power ar the same sire ar which rhey sought ro arrack ir in rhe sovereign They musr be made to feel it in their body Hence rhe elaborate torrures whose goal is ro maximize pain and ro assert the unassailable power of the sovereign in a way rhar is unmistakable borh ro criminals and ro rhe people al ike As rhe criminal is raughr a lesson in power rhe people are both resrored to rhe security rheir sovereign can 70 GENEALOGICAl HISTORIES OF WHO WE ARE offer them and warned against vio lating that sovereignty themselves The public execution Foucault says has a juridicopol irical function It is a ceremonial by which a momentari ly injured sovereign is reconstituted It restores that sovereignty by manifesting it at irs most spectacular DP 48 One can see then why punishment cannot be a blind rage However agon izing it may be for the criminal it remains an expression of the sovereign and rhus must bear the stamp of both his power and his bearing In order to do so it must be controlled To strike without control is a display of weakness not strength  There are at least two potential difficulties with this particular exercise of the power to punish The first is that the grand display of this asymmetry of power can backfire Alongside the public awe at the power of the king and alongside the fear that that power invokes it can also happen  and it did happen  that the public comes to identify with the object of punishment and rhus becomes resentfu l of the sovereign T his is particularly true when the criminal displays dignity under torture or when the punishment seems to go roo far into the realm of the spectacular or when the criminal derides the authorities for their own abuses In cases like these the public comes at rimes to identify with the criminal and this leads to resistance against these exercises of sovereignty In add ition all criminal ity represents a rebell ion against the current social order a rebellion that would find sympathy in a large portion of a public who suffers under great d isparities in wealth and comfort that are parr of the structure of that order T he cure for all this it would seem would be to soften punishment to make it less an expression of power and more an expression of justice And indeed there is a reform movement that seeks to soften punishment Bur nor only soften it A number of changes are raking place during the second half of the eighteenth century The sh ift from a criminality of blood to a criminal ity of fraud forms parr of a whole complex mechanism embracing the development of production the increase of wealth a higher juridical and moral value placed on property relations stricter methods of surveillance a righter partitioning of the population more efficient techniques of locating and obtaining information DP 77 Because of these changes and in particular because of the change of property relations to which many of these relate another concern comes to the surface as wel l Up to this point punishment is as sporadic as it is gruesome To be sure the consequences of gening caught are dire However many people do not get caught and this is the second difficulty with supplice The arrangement 71 THE PHilOSOPHY O f FOUCAULT works tolerably wel l as long as the institution of private property is in irs infancy Bur as it matures with it grows the necessity of a more universal form of punishment Al l property must be protected and since property is dispersed among many individuals protection from criminality must be afforded to all of them The true objective of the reform movement even it irs most general formulations was nor so much ro establish a new right ro punish based on more equitable principles as to set up a new economy of the power to punish   so that it should be distributed in homogeneous circu its capable of operating everywhere in a continuous way down to the finest grain of the social body Ibid 80 The question becomes how is this to happen How can one construct a penal structure that will protect against all the perry crimes that had once been tacitly rolerared while at rhe same rime generating universal respect so that it does nor suffer the same problems as supplice To this the penal reformers have an answer One must design punishments that are cal ibrated to crimes so as to ensure deterrence If the loss to be incurred outweighs the gain of the crime and if one is certain that by committing that crime one will also incur that loss the crime is less likely robe commirred6 To find the suitable punishment for a crime is to find the disadvantage whose idea is such that it robs for ever the idea of a crime of any attraction ibid 104 In addition the populace is less likely to become upset with the authorities Since the response is nor ro perform an outrage upon the body bur to deter crime then there is no spectacle to which the public is called to react A sober system of measured punishments is what is needed to eliminate crime  particularly crime against property ro ensure public order and ro be capable of universal application Why is it then that rather than adopting this system of punishments each designed ro deter the crime it responds ro only one type of punishment emerges for everyone during the early nineteenth century Why is it that there emerges a single answer for all crimes an answer that remains with us today W hy imprisonment The subtitle of Discipline and Punish is La Naissance de Ia prison the birth of the prison It is at this point that Foucaults genealogical method begins ro emerge Up to this point it is easy ro thin k that the story Foucault is telling is a linear one that it traces a singu lar th read through its chronological weave This would nor be genealogy as Foucault describes it in his essay on Nietzsche It wou ld involve a unity of origin rather than a d ispersion that comes together into a temporary unity And because of this it 72 GENEALOGICAl HISTORIES OF WHO WE ARE would invite a reading that sees history as either progressive or regressive Either punishment is better and more humane than it used to be or it is worse This is nor how Foucault approaches the birth o f the prison To be sure there is a certa in continuity between earl ier and later forms of punishment They are both after a ll ways of dealing with criminal ity And moreover both involve the app lication of particular techniques to the body However the later form of punishment which Foucault calls discipline is nor merely a development from an insular history of punishment If it were then one wou ld expect that the advice of the reformers of the late eigh teenth century wou ld have been taken It is not In fact the emergence of the prison is in direct contradiction to the ideas of the reformers Rather than marching punishment to crime it affords a single punishment for all cnmes To account for this emergence Foucault looks beyond the prison to other more farflung practices The invention of this new po litical anatomy must not be seen as a sudden discovery It is rather a multiplicity of often minor processes of different origin and scattered location which overlap repeat or imitate one another support one another distinguish themselves from one another according to their domain of application converge and gradually produce the blueprint of a general method Ibid  138 Among these minor processes are the regimented rime schedules characteristic of the monastery and the precisely calibrated movements that are taught to the so ld iers of the Prussian army These and other practices gradually converge on the issue of punishment and over the course of the late eigh teenth and early nineteenth centuries yield the blueprint of a general method of discipline Discipline as Foucaul t uses the term is more specific than simply the control of the behaviour of others It may be defined as the project for the bodys optimization for turning the body into a well regulated machine by means of breaking down irs movements into their smallest elements and then building them back into a maximally efficient whole This project does not simply concern individuals however It also concerns their relations Discip line must ensure that space is properly partitioned so that individuals can relate to one another in maximally efficient ways It must ensure the proper rime coordination among activities as weJI as within them It is a process that is applied both to bodies and to the interaction between them 73 THE PHilOSOPHY OF FOUCAULT The ability to accomplish this requ ires an enclosed area in which the movements of individuals and the partitioned space of their relations can be monitored and intervened upon That is what a prison is If discipl ine sounds like training for factory work it should It is also however how schools are run break down what is to be learned into manageable segments and then have students master each segment before moving on It is how businesses are run how hospitals are run often how athletics is taught and how we run our lives As Foucault asks Is it surprising that prisons resemble factories schools barracks hospitals wh ich all resemble prisons DP 228 Foucaul t isolates three central aspects of disciplinary training hierarchical observation normalizing judgement and examination Hierarchical observation involves a certain economy of the gaze There are observers and observed The observer is to monitor the observed from a hierarchical distance so that the observer sees but is nor seen and the observed is seen bur does nor see or at least does nor see the observer  In this way the observer can see what the observed is doing what they are nor doing and how well or poorly they are doing it For their part the observed since they are continuously monitored become subject to the gaze of the observer They must always be on They can never let up They must be as efficient as possible Normal izing judgement is a binary operation that works by means of both conformity and individualization Conformity is to the norm itself the standard that each must strive to meet individual ity is the requirement of a set of interventions on particular individuals in order to get them to ach ieve the norm These interventions are trained upon minute elements of a persons behaviour They come to bear at very specific points in the behavioural unfolding of an activity seeking to maximize it through rewards punishments or other types of motivation Think of a child who cannot use her fork in the proper manner Here the parent says first hold it like this Good very good Now bring it down to your food No nor like that thats wrong like this Yes better   The emergence of normalization is a revolution nor only in penal reform but also in the conception and character of who we are Foucault describes normalizing judgement as directly opposed ro earlier approaches to punishment which operate  nor by hierarchizing but quire simply by bringing into play the binary opposi tion of the permitted and the forbidden nor by homogenizing bur by operating the division acquired once and for all of condemnation ibid 183 In earl ier forms of punishment one does nor worry about where one stands in relation to the norm or the normal The reason for this is that there is no norm or normal There are acts that are forbidden and others  the rest that are permitted For the former there 74 GENEALOGICAl HISTORIES OF WHO WE ARE are dire consequences if one is caught For the latter there is no need for intervention There may be t raditions govern ing behaviour bur there are no norms of the kind discipline develops Contrast that with our more normalized society Who among us does nor wonder whether their behaviour is normal W ho among us is nor constrained by the concern that they may be weird or off or nor li ke everyone else Who is nor driven in parr by the motivation to avoid the need for counsel ling or therapy or some other intervention w hose goal is to pur one back on the right track Who does not feel the shadow of normality over their shoulder In o lder forms of punishment the binary division between the permitted and the forbidden leaves one side of that division alone In a society in thrall to normalization no behaviour is immune to scrutiny As my therapist friends say everyone is a little sick so everyone can benefit from some therapy When the say it they mean ir as an advertisement for their profession bur it reveals a deeper truth one Foucault finds in the emergence of discipline The power of the Norm appears throughout the disciplines Is this the new law of modern society Let us say rather that since the eighteenth century it has joined other powers  the Law the Word Parole and the Text Tradition  imposing new del imitations upon them Ibid  184 We might recal l here the analysis in Histoire de Ia folie of the emergence of the moral character of therapy in the practices ofT uke and Pinel The bonds placed by these figures are no longer physical ones they are moral and psychological Concurrent with the rise of normalization there is also the rise of psychology as both a science of the normal and a practice of turning the abnormal into the normal Psychology as a study o f and intervention into human behaviour has irs roots and irs orientation provided by the twin poles of conformity and individualization characteristic of the normalizing judgement of discipl ine Here we see at work one of the concepts for which Foucault has become famous and at rimes notorious power knowledge It is probably the most often misunderstood concept in his corpus The concept of powerknowledge denies that one can hold knowledge to be divorced from power that one cn partition off all the relations of power in which people are involved in order to ach ieve a knowledge purged of politic impurities a neutral ground so to speak Perhaps he says we should abandon a who le tradition that allows us to imagine that knowledge can exist only where the power relations are suspended and that knowledge can develop only outside irs injunctions irs demands and irs interests ibid 27 75 THE PHilOSOPHY OF FOUCAULT This does nor mean however rhar all knowledge is reducible ro power relations or rhar knowledge is simply a mask for power T hat would nor be powerknowledge ir would just be power Instead we should think of knowledge as something that is embedded in inseparable from power relations bur sti ll a form of knowledge In fact as we shall see in detai l when we discuss power in the context of the first volume of Foucaults history of sexual ity the emergence of knowledge and its object can occur at the same rime Psychological knowledge for example is parr of a larger whole discipline that does nor simply understand bur at the same rime creates llvho e are To pur the point another way power does nor only stop things from happening It is not merely a negative or repressive operation It also creates things If this is the case then psychological knowledge is not simply a mask for power lr actually is knowledge bur it is knowledge of something it has also participated in creating These powerknowledge relations are ro be analysed therefore not on the basis of a subject of knowledge who is or is not free in relation to the power system bur on the cont rary the subject who knows the objects to be known and the modalities of knowledge must be regarded as so many effects of these fundamenta l implications of powerknowledge and their historical transformations Ibid 27 8 In add ition to hierarch ical observation and norma lizing judgement discipline involves a third element examination We have all been subject to it whether in school during job training or in a hospital The examination forms an element of the feedback loop of discipline lr marks our where each of us stands relative to the standard the Norm to which we are being compared If hierarchical observation seeks to maximize efficiency by overseeing activity the examination provides the feedback necessary ro recognize the degree to which that efficiency has been internalized the degree to which ir has become parr o f us or in the terms we have been using has become a parr of who we are now Foucaul t sums up rhe elements of discipl ine and their operation in rhe arresting image of Jeremy Benthams Panopricon Bentham rhe founder of modern uti litarian moral theory offers in 1791 a design for a prison one that is never built rhar he ca lls rhe Panopricon Essentially the Panopricon is constructed like a ring around a central core T he ring holds the prisoners rhe cenrral core the guards The prison is constructed so that the guards can look out and see inside all the prison cells The prisoners however cannot see into rhe central core Therefore although one cannot watch all 76 GENEALOGICAl HISTORIES OF WHO WE ARE the prisoners at once no prisoner can see who is being observed and who is nor One must act as though one is always being observed since at any particular momem one might be Bur there is more In the Panopricon since one cannot see the guards and since one must assume that one is being watched all the rime there do nor actually have to be any guards in the cemral core The prisoners in essence guard themselves They act as though they are under surveillance even if there is nobody there to observe them And that Foucault concludes is our condition Given the suffusion of discipline across broad swaths of our society we are in a condition of whar he calls panopricism Even if there is no one watching us even if we are not being monitored we act as though we are We wonder why we are normal as we mentioned a moment ago because we are our own prison guards In a society filled with psychoservices from therap ists to social workers O personnel counsellors there is no need for everyone to be watched As these services proliferate most of us will begin to watch ourselves We saw above that there are some cominuiries between penal d iscip line and earlier forms of punishmem in particular that both had to do with penal iry and that both are focused on the body We can see now that the later forms of each are although cominuous in one sense in another sense far removed from their earlier versions Penal iry is no longer a project of punishment It is nor even strictly speaking a project of deterrence It is a project of normalization of what penal theorists call re habilitation Rather than vengeance there is care Rather than torture there is d iscip line Those who currently impugn the prisons for being too soft on prisoners are right in a sense The project of imprisonmem is no longer one of extracting a price for an injury against the social body However those cri tics miss the larger disciplinary whole imo which this softer rearmem firs The role of the body has changed as we ll It has changed from being a sire of pain to being a sire of normalization It is the place where our psychological stare our normalization is created When Foucault calls his study of the prisons an elemem in a genealogy of the modern soul DP 29 we can see why The modern soul is the psychological soul one whose moral componems are embedded in a logic of rhe normal and the abnormal We are held in thrall to this modern soul not simply because it is imposed on us bur because at this particular rime in our history it is who we are Or better since there is nothing that so lely is who we are it is as Foucault says an elemem of who we are a cemrally imporram one And because we are held in thrall to it and because it is one of the crucial sources of our conformity it is no surprise when Foucault inverting the old Christian formula declares that the soul is the prson of the body ibid 30 77 THE PHILOSOPHY Of FOUCAULT O f course as many wi ll point our the prison as a project of rehabilitation is a failure Recidivism rates are high many prisoners consider the therapeutic aspects of prison a joke and as we have come to understand many projects of psychological therapy have at best uneven success in changing attitudes or behaviour The prison as a sire of discipline has nor created the kind of environment in which discipl ine can rake hold And yet the prison remains the major response to criminal ity How does Foucault explain this He does nor deny the failure of the prison What he seeks to understand instead is irs continuance in the face of irs failure There must he believes be some function that prisons continue to serve if demonstrated fai lure is nor enough to dismantle them In fact there are two one having to do with prisoners themselves and the other with the society at large Regarding prisoners the prison becomes parr of an entire sysrem where cerrain criminals who cannor be rehabi litated can at least be monitored Prisons parole officers police informants all these become reliays in a larger system of survei llance where criminal ity can be overseen at rimes even uti lized when it can nor be el iminated T he dream of the early prison reformers or later of the practitioners of discipline is indeed a d ream There will always be criminality particularly in societies where goods are as unevenly distributed as they are in Western societies Therefore where one can impose discipline successfully one does Vhere one cannot one uses the same resources to construct a system of survei llance rhat can at least monitor what it cannot change The effects of the prison on the society at large are perhaps more important It is nor simply the prison itself bur the larger carceral archipelago DP 298 composed of social workers psychologists psychiat rists personnel counsellors judges the legal system fami ly doctors and others of which it is a necessary parr T he carceral archipelago generates important effects on the texture of our society Near the end of Discipline and Punish Foucault isolates six of those effects The carceral archipelago blurs the line between the legal and the illegal allowing for conrinuous d isciplinary intervention It can recruit the delinquents it creates in order to monitor crime It makes the idea of punishment itself seem natural or inevitable particularl y since it is done without violence but instead by means of softer d isciplinary procedures It permits a new form of law one that is no longer beholden to the binary opposition of the permirred and the forbidden It allows the proliferation of procedures of examination and normalization throughout society Finally it reinforces the importance of the prison itself regardless of its failure as the ultimate and often most th reatening si te of disciplinary intervention In short the carceral archipelago of which the prison is a central element sustains the discipl inary character of society 78 GENEALOGICAl HISTORIES OF WHO WE ARE even when it cannot accomplish the disciplinary project of rehabilitating criminals Discipline and Punish is Foucaults most sustained genealogical discussion of who we are now We can see in it all the e lements of a genealogy the dispersed character of origins the effects of what N ietzsche would undoubtedly call reactivity the historical conringency of the unfolding of practices the lowly character of the practices themselves that wind up converging to create part of who we are We shall shortly turn to the view of power that underlies this work a view that receives substantial elaboration in Foucaults next book the first volume of his history of sexuality Before that however it would be worth pausing again to ask after the accuracy of Foucaults history of discipline It is a question that Foucault himse lf recognizes as legitimate since in that next volume he ra ises it himself Discussing his view of power as creative rather than simp ly prohibitive he asks Beyond these few phosphorescences the suggestive historical changes he has just d iscussed in regard to sexuality are we not sure to find once more the somber law that always says no The answer wll have to come our of a historical inquiry HS 72 Perhaps the most sustained alternative to Foucaults history of the prisons is Pierer Spierenbergs The Spectacle of Suffering7 Spierenberg sees his own work as a contrast to Discipline and Punish and writes that his project is one that attempts to construct a counterparadigm to Foucaults Along the way Spierenberg makes a number of criticisms of Foucaults work many of which seem to be based on a misreading of Foucaults book For instance he writes that Foucault speaks of the political danger immanent in executions which he considers the real cause of their eventual disappearance Spierenberg concedes that there is resistance to executions at rimes bur notes that there is no evidence that rh is alone leads to the end of public executions As we have seen however Foucault s genealogical method resists the very idea of a real cause Causality is complex and dispersed and Foucault indicates that the decline of public executions has as much to do with economic and po litical changes as it does with any resistance to the practice itsel f Spierenbergs main thesis however is that Foucault is mistaken to think that there is a sudden historical break in the areeighteenth and earlynineteenth centuries that leads to the demise of torture and the emergence of discipl ine Using arch ival research nor only from France bur also from other places in Europe 10 particularly England and the Netherlands Spierenberg seeks to show that the emergence of the prison is a slower process occurring over a longer period of rime than Foucault ascribes to it and that older practices continue to exist alongside the newer disciplinary practices of the prison The fact that the completion of the privatization 79 THE PHilOSOPHY OF FOUCAULT of repression rook abour rworh irds of rhe ninereenrh cenrury in most Vesrern European counrries adds up ro a cri tique of FoucaulTs views Does ir First one must concede rhar Foucaul ts research is often cenrered on France Spierenbergs work like Klaus Doerners on madness draws from a wider range of counrries Secondly in as much as Foucault ascribes a radical break Spierenbergs work would serve as a corrective lr is nor clear however rhar rhe ascribed break is as radical as Spierenberg makes ir our ro be In his archaeological period Foucault talks in terms of decisive historical disconrinuiries The siruarion is more complicated in rhe genealogical works Those involve emergences rhar appear more nuanced That there is sooner or later a new historical siruarion is certainly one of Foucault s claims Spierenberg does nor deny this However when Spierenberg calls Foucault a srrucruralisr as he does in rhe rexr he seems robe rhinking more of rhe approach of some of Foucaults archaeological works rhan his genealogical ones For instance when Spierenberg wrires rhar From his srrucruralisr perspective he is describing a sysrem and ir is irrelevanT ro him which particular poinr in rime one picks ro invesrigare rhar sysrem rhar irrelevance would app ly more TO an archaeologica l view of archives rhan ir would TO a genealogical view of the inrerweaving of historically exrended and modified practices In an archaeological view there is wirhin a given archive a srabiliry of discursive rules rhar remains unril a historical break In a genealogical view however rhe practices rhar converge and diverge do nor necessarily do so in accordance wirh any larger cui rural or subculrural rhemes Who we are is nor this ar one rime and that ar another The themes rhar comprise us are fluid and historically staggered In thar sense Spierenberg by according as much historical weight ro what happens ourside of France as wirhin ir helps reinforce the fluid character of hisrory in a way that Foucault does nor emphasize in Discipline and Pzmish Thar would make ir a conrribution ro a genealogical hisrory rather rhan an undermining of ir The exrenr to which Sp ierenbergs analys is is historically better than Foucaults is beyond my expertise ro say However as I menrioned earl ier Foucaults work borh genealogical and archaeological lies ar the inrersecrion of both philosophy and history We should see his works then as engaging and open ro borh d isciplines From rhe philosophical perspective there are severa l novel conrriburions of Discipline and Punish Ir questions a progressive view of hisrory wirhour

conringenr hisTOry lr places knowledge in rhe conrexr of polirics These changes are nor isola red 80 GENEALOGICAl HISTORIES OF WHO WE ARE from one another For instance if there are aspects of who we are that are matters of historical change rather than being immutable and if that historical change is contingent then our history cannot be one of necessary progress or regress Or again if knowledge is a matter of politics then the Christian heritage of the privileging of the soul over the body can come into question not only epistemologically but also politically Underlying all of these contributions is another one Utilized in the book on the prisons and explained in the first volume of his history of sexual ity is a new view of the operation of power It is not that all of these other changes are reducible to this new view of power Rather it is that they all appeal to it moreover it gives each of them a force they would lack without it At a first go we might say that for Foucault power acts as much as or more through what it creates than through what it represses There is a traditional view of power that informs almost all po litical though t It can be seen particularly in the liberal tradition of political ph ilosophy The view is rhar power works primari ly if nor solely by stopping certain things from happening Here is a rough sketch In the social contraer ind ividuals give up certain of their freedoms to the stare In this way the stare becomes extraordinarily powerful lr can intervene in peoples lives in order ro prevenr them from do ing all sorts of things There must then be checks placed upon the state Those checks prevent rhe stare from overstepping its legitimate bounds The checks can be internal to the state for instance a separation of powers of the kind the US Constirution provides they can also be external for instance in limiting the powers of the state to dominate public discussion as in freedom of the press finally they can be a combination of the rwo However these checks work they must allow individuals to be able to conduct their lives with the protection and support of but nor rhe undue interference by the state This brief admittedly inadequate sketch of liberal political phi losophy is meant ro illuminate rwo related themes rhar characterize rhar phi losophy the centrality of the stare and the negative view of power rhar is the view of power as repressive These themes lean upon each other If we look ar power from the standpoinr of the state we are likely ro see something large imposing and repressive Power is what stares have that can inrerfere with the ability of individuals to carry out their lives Think of the mi litary the police prisons From the other side if we look ar rhe state from the standpoint of a repressive or negative power we are likely to see something monolithic that needs to be curbed so that it does not become tyrannical But suppose we approach power in a different fashion Suppose we turn away from the state and look closer to the ground ar our everyday practices Suppose we rake a genealogical turn and ask Where and how does a part icular form of power arise instead of the liberal question of Who has 81 THE PHilOSOPHY OF FOUCAULT power In rhar case power can appear very differently from the way ir does in liberal theory This is nor TO say rhar Foucault denies rhar there is such a thing as repressive power or rhar rhe stare possesses ir This is a common misreading of his work Rather ir is ro say that ofren rhe more effective forms of power come from below rather than above from our practices rather than from rhe stare lr is also TO say rhar this often more effective power operates by creating objects rather than by repressing them lr should be emphasized here rhar rhe emergence of this form of power is itself a historical marrer Ir relies on more advanced techno logies of communication more dominanr population cenrres such as cities rhe rise of medical and related health sciences and greater economic inregration I f ir is true rhar rhe juridical system rhe binary system of rhe permined and the forbidden with irs repressive view of power was useful for represenring albeit in a nonexhaustive way a power rhar was cen tered primarily around deduction prelevement and death ir is utterly incongruous with the new methods of power whose operation is nor ensured by r ight but by technique not by law but by normalization nor by punishmenT but by conrrol methods rhar are employed on all levels and in forms that go beyond the stare and its apparatus HS 89 u If creative forms of power are at one rime marginal they are now cenrral in the practices in which we engage and through which we become who we are who we are now If we are ro deepen our understanding we musr ask two questions what does Foucault mean by power and how does ir work T he first quest ion is one rhar Foucaul t mostly avoids He does nor he tells us wanr to give us a theory of power but rather to describe its operation in particular historical situations Nevertheless using the term as cenrrally as he does he must have something in mind And in an essay enritled The Subject and Power he does offer a renrative defini tion of power In effect what defines a relationship of power is rhar ir is a mode of action which does nor act directly and immediately on others Instead ir acts upon their actions an action upon an action on exist ing actions or on rhose which may arise in rhe presenr or rhe future SP 220 Foucaul t conrrasrs power and violence Violence forces a body ro do something it compels without the possibility of resistance Power on the other hand works by what we migh t call influence instead of violence Ir 82 GENEALOGICAl HISTORIES OF WHO WE ARE works nor by rescrainr bm by inducing something to happen This is why Foucault says Power is exercised only over free subjects and only insofar as they are free ibid 221 Power works by taking an open field of possible actions and constructing certain pathways of actions that are more likely co be taken Normalization for instance does nor work by violence upon rhe body bm rather by observ ing and examining a body and lead ing ic co become more efficiem There is a kinship between chis definition of power and rhe hiscorical comingency to which Foucault is committed If power works by influencing or by inducing a free body rather chan by force then its ho ld is more fragile chan we might otherwise chink Although normalization lies deeply embedded in our concepcion of who we are ic does so only by means of irs influence and by irs inherence in so many of our practices T here are ocher ways we can be ways that can be explored through the construction of new practices Vho we are now is historically comingem If chis is Foucaults view of what power is how does ic work Yhac can we say abom the ways power relations in fluence or induce our behaviour In the first volume of his history of sexual icy Foucault offers what might be cal led his five theses on power power is nor a possession power is nor exterior co ocher relations power comes from below power relations are  imemional and nonsubjeccive power always comes with resistance HS 94 5 lr is worth pausing over each of these t heses To chink of power as a possession is to think in accordance with the t radit ional view of power lr is co seek co understand and regulate the enricy usually the scare that has rhe most of it  Bm power can work wichom belonging co anybody Actions can const rain other actions without any bodys possessing rhe power of char conscraim Tuke and Pinel for instance possess no power over the mad T heir imervemions are merely expressions of discursive and practical regularities But chose imervemions actions upon actions help co create and sustain a new type of bondage of the mad In the terms we have been using their imervemions help make the mad who they were to become Or again chose who work in the medical field or who reach or who engage in psychotherapy do nor have the power of d iscip line over chose they monitor or supervise Rather they are in a relation with chose ochers char is itself one of discipline Normal izacion is nor something they impose but instead something in which they participate To say that power is nor exterior co ocher relations is to generalize rhe lesson of power knowledge Knowledge is nor in a relation of exterioriry co power Neither is health psychotherapy penal icy or as we shall shordy see sex Ve muse be carefu l here though As we saw with knowledge co say char ocher relations are nor immune co power is nor the same thing as saying char they are all reducible co power char they are really about 83 THE PHilOSOPHY OF FOUCAULT power Power is interwoven into these and other practices in complex ways If one is to understand the operation of power within them it requires a patient historical analysis of the way power arises within and across practices nor a sweeping general ization about everything being simply a marrer of power This is in parr because power comes from below Power in the sense Foucault approaches ir is nor a possession of rhe stare a marrer of the economy or the expression of some overarching historical theme It lies in the dispersion of everyday practices that are the aerher of our lives In my rais ing of my children in the postal workers interact ion wi th customers in the warden s observation of prisoners in the holidaymakers choice of hotels there is power I r is nor a power that one possesses over another there may be that roo bur that is nor what Foucault is gerring at  rather it is a power that lies in the practices itself creating who we are through our participation in them We would of course refuse to say that all of these practices are nothing bur power at work To say that would be at best silly probably meaningless There is more going on in what we do every day than merely power And that would be Foucaults point Power is everywhere to be sure bur this does nor mean that power is everything The point that power comes from below from w hat Foucaul t sometimes calls the capillaries reinforces that point Foucaults phrase that power relations are  intentional and nonsubjecrive has often been misunderstood It sounds as though there is a certain goal that power has in mind even if that goal is nor the motivation of particular ind ividuals Foucaults choice of words may reinforce this view  There is no power that is exercised wi thout a series of aims and objectives Bur this does nor mean that it results from the choice or decision of an ind ividual subject HS 95 We need nor however read any anthropomorph izing of power here Power relations themselves do not want or aim at or seek to ach ieve anything We might berrer understand the idea if we use the term oriented Power relations are oriented in certain directions They have regu larities that conduce to some kinds of behaviour and nor others Discipline involves a set of power relations that are oriented Historically a dispersion of practices  or at least elements of those practices  come together to induce individuals to become normalized and inseparably to think of themselves in terms of normalization This orientation is nor the aim or goa l of anything It is the product of various intersections and borrowings in a particular historical context and with a recogn izable set of consequences It is the task of a genealogy ro trace those intersections and borrowings and to describe their consequences T he orientation of intersections borrowings and consequences is what Foucault refers to with the term intentional 84 GENEALOGICAL HISTORIES OF WHO WE ARE The idea that Where there is power there is resistance ibid is an elusive one It can be taken in at least rwo d ifferent ways The first way would be to claim that in principle power requ ires resistance There can be no power without resistance I am uncomfortable with this claim If power is a set of actions upon actions that create objects in the way Foucault describes it does nor seem necessary ro think of resistance as an inevitable parr of power relations Since force is nor involved could there nor be relations of power that are without resistance There is reason to think otherwise However we might understand this fifth thesis in a weaker sense It is nor rhar power relations require resistance and cannot exist without ir bur rather that there always seems to be resistance where there are relations of power In other words power does nor imply resistance bur often comes coupled with ir This seems a muclh more defensible claim justifying ir is a matter of turning ro the historical record And indeed Foucault shows in Discipline and Punish rhar various power arrangements have been mer with resistance even if those resisri ng do nor know exacrly what it is they are opposing For instance near the end of the book Foucault describes the criticism of penal discipline in workers newspapers of the nineteenth century showing how they have an intu ition of the stakes of discipline without a nuanced grasp of irs operation These fives theses amount to a view of a type of power that does nor merely suppress or repress bur rhar actively creates  W ithout anyones controlling ir power arises in everyday practices orienting our behaviour and our knowledge in particular historically contingent ways Ye rarely understand these ways fu lly bur often rry ro resist them And by our participating in these practices we ourselves become embedded in relations of power even when we resist them Ye become what those relations orient us to become and we pave the way for others to become it as well To pur the point another way power helps create who we are or at least who we are now Recall here Foucaults earlier statement that we often know what we do and why we are doing it what we do nor know is what our doing it does What our doing it does is reinforce power relations rhar elude our cogni tive grasp nor because we are d istant from them bur for the opposite reason that they are so much a parr of who we are It is the project of a genealogy ro display those relations before us in their proximity their complexity and their historical contingency A history of sexuality The first volume of Foucaul ts history of sexuality sketches another genealogical project this one tied ro sex rather than discipline Although the next 85 THE PHilOSOPHY O f FOUCAULT and lasr rwo published volumes of rhe history of sexuality rake on a d ifferem approach from rhe one outlined in rhe first volume rhe historical sketch Foucault offers there has been as influential as his book on rhe prisons in parr because ir invites a radical reorientation of how we rhink abour sex The History of Sexuality Volume I is published in 1976 a year after rhe book on rhe prisons lr announces and sketches a project on sexuality rhar appears less radical now rhan ir does ar thar rime in parr because we no longer live at a moment we would be rempred ro call one of sexual liberation In rhe rhirry years since rhe publication of rhis book much of whar seems novel rhen is now a matter of course If anything our sexual practices are a subject o f arrack from rhe right rather rhan as ir appears rhen a provocation by rhe left At rhe beginning of rhe book on sexuality Foucault describes our rhen current view of sex under rhe rerm rhe repressive hypothesis The repressive hypothesis is a story abour our sexuality lr is a srory of sexual awakening Once we were sexual ly repressed This sexual repression which has long been wirh us perhaps achieves irs zenith in rhe Victorian period bur has been sustained rhroughour much of rhe rwenrierh century Wirh rhe various movements for liberation in rhe 1960s and here recall rhe evenrs o f May 68 rhe recognition of rhe need for sexual liberation arises Sexual repression after all is nor only bad in itself ir also conrribures to other ills includ ing rhe repression of womens sexuality discrimination against homosexuality a general cul rural conformism and rhe suppress ion of other desires Now in rhe period of rhe late 1960s and early 1970s we have liberated our sexuality and wi rh rhar liberation have opened the door ro or her liberations from rhe constraints of bourgeois society There is more rhan a little in fluence of psychoanalytic rhoughr in rhe repressive hy pothesis The rheme o f sexual repression rhe idea rhar such repression is linked to other social phenomena  in particular rhe susraining of bourgeois society  and rhe focus on desire are all legacies of psychoanalysis In rhe United Stares and Britain where psychoanalysis has always been less influential rhan during rhese years in France rhe possibility o f a psychoanalytic background to rhe repressive hypothesis may seem to be strained However ir does find irs way inro Anglophone countries through such works as Herbert Marcuses Eros and Civilization In France rhe rise of psychoanalytic rhoughr under rhe influence of Jacques Lacan makes ir during rhis period almost de rigueur for leftists ro appropriate psychoanalytic elements inro progressive theory Perhaps rhe mosr lasting of rhese works is Deleuze and Guattaris AntiOedipus a book rhar rejects psychoanalysis bur which on rhe other hand appropriates and reworks a Lacanian concept o f desire 86 GENEALOGICAl HISTORIES OF WHO WE ARE There are many questions one might put to the repressive hypothesis Have we really liberated ourselves from sexual repression If so has this indeed led us to other forms of liberation Hasnt sexual liberation simply been appropriated by capital ism to open up new products and new types of marketing Foucault however follows a different path He asks a question that casts doubt on the founding assumptions of these other questions Has there ever been he wonders such a thing as sexual repression If there hasnt then not only could we not have liberated ourselves from it we cannot wonder what effects this liberation might or might not have had It wou ld seem odd to say that there has never been anyth ing like sexual repression Does the Victorian period not exhibit much greater discretion about sexual issues than we do Hasnt the open discussion of sex long been a taboo subject To say that there never was sexual repression however is not the same thing as saying that there was never any discretion in regard to sexual matters It is quite possible that there was an expurgation  and a very rigorous one  of the au thorized vocabulary It may be true that a whole rhetoric of allusion and metaphor was codified  At the level of discourses and their domains however practically the opposite phenomenon occurred There was a steady proliferation of discourses concerned with sex HS 1718 Discourse on sex in periods previous to our own is discreet to be sure but it is also pervasive How does this concern with sex arise In accord ance with genealogical practice Foucault finds its roots not in a single cause but in the convergence of disparate concerns One of them has to do with the Catholic confessional In the face o f the Reformation the confessional undergoes a change Where previously one confesses forbidden acts now one must confess not on ly the acts that one commits but also ones desires It is not simply what one does that is the object of confessional it is what one thinks and wants especially with regard to sex According to the new pastoral sex must not be named imprudently but its aspects its correlations and its effects must be pursued down to their slenderest ramifications a shadow in a daydream an image too slowly d ispelled a badly exorcised complicity between the bodys mechanics and the minds complacency everything had to be told Ibid 19 If we recall the project o f norma lization from Discipline and Punish we can see here the change from a binary logic of the pennitted and the forbidden to a wider logic of the normal and the abnormal 87 THE PHilOSOPHY O f FOUCAULT In addition to changes in the confessional there is an economic focus on sex The beginnings of an industrial economy raise questions about how populations are to be sustained and utilized One of the great innovations in the techniques o f power in the eighteenth century was the emergence of population as an economic and po litical problem population as wealth population as manpower or labor capacity population balanced between irs own growth and the resources it commanded Ibid 25 Vhere there is concern with population there w ill also be concern with sex how it happens what it leads to and how it should be regulated There are other sources as well in biology in medicine in psychology in pedagogy In schools for instance whi le sex is nor spoken of the architecture of dormitories disp lays a greater concern with the partitions dividing boys and girls What these various sources converge on is sex Sex as the centrepiece sex as the object sex as the secret and ultimately sex as the truth In d irect contrast ro the repressive hypothesis sex is nor something hidden that has just come to ligh t What is peculiar to modern societies in fact is not that they consigned sex to a shadow existence bur rhar they dedicated themselves to speaking of it ad infinitum whi le exploi ting it as the secret ibid 35 In this sense the sexual liberation of the period in which Foucault writes is not a break from the past it is simply a continuation of the concern with sex that has characrerzed the West for several hundred years Moreover psychoanalysis wh ich frames the repressive hypothesis is far from being an abandonment of rel igion in favour of something more progressive or better grounded epistemologically It is instead a form of the confessional carried on by other means Sex is our truth in our sexual desire we discover the secret of who we are and the key to proper social regu lation Over the course of the past several cenmries sex has become one of the key pivots about which the answer to the question of who we are revo lves And because power is inseparable from knowledge the investigation of sex is a political as well as an episremic one T hat investigation is nor only a maner of discovery It is also a matter of actions upon actions that create what is investigated Both in the empirical and theoretical research into sex as welll as the individual confession of ones desires  to the priest to the psychoanalyst to the counsellor or social worker  one is being studied and created Practices that centre on sex are creating a sexual being or better d ifferent types of beings that are defining themselves by their relation to sex Foucault suggests four figures that arise from the concern with sex They are elements of the creation as he puts ir of sexuality as a historical 88 GENEALOGICAl HISTORIES OF WHO WE ARE phenomenon our of sex These figures are the hysterical woman the masmrbaring ch ild the perverse adult and the Malthusian couple The hysterical woman has her roots in earl ier views of sex The idea of hysteria comes from the movement of the womb around the womans body The Greek term hysterikos means womb T his theme is appropriated over the course of the nineteenth century to link women and their nervous conditions to sexuality Sex is the truth of the hysterical woman who is to be found in almost all women The masturbating child is the product of the d iscovery of the sexual character of ch ildhood T he chi ld once though t to be presexual is now thought and feared to be saturated with sexuality from an early age The question arises of what to do with this newly d iscovered sexual character of children In one of the recently published series of necrures from Foucaults tenu re at the College de France Abnormal Foucault documents measures used to channel ch ildhood sexuality measures that find their root in a profusion of texts from the middle of the eighteenth century on the dangers of childhood masmrbarion In essence at least for bourgeois fami lies there emerges a fear of outside caretakers as potential sexual abusers provoking masturbation in ch ildren T his leads to a privileging of the nuclear fam ily as the necessary condition for healthy ch ildhood sexuality and consequently to the responsibility of the parents for a childs sexual upbringing The childs sexuality is the trick by which the closeknit affective substantial and cellu lar fam ily was constituted and from whose shelter the child was extracted ALCF 257 15 The perverse adult is exemplified of course by the homosexual Homosexuals are defined  and to this day remain defined  by their sexuality It is the key to who they are T his does nor mean that homosexuality itself is a matter of sex that is an obvious truth  It means that homosexuals themselves as people are defined by their sexuality W ho they are can be discovered through an investigation of their sexual desires As Foucault sums it up the sexual instinct was isolated as a separate biological and psych ical instinct a clinical analysis was made of all the forms of anomalies by which it could be afflicted it was assigned a role of normalization or parhologization wi th respect to all behavior and finally a corrective technology was sought for these anomal ies HS 105 The perverse adult is the person defined by a warp ing of sexual desire That warping fu lfi ls two roles First it warrants intervention by various psychological and social agencies Secondly since this waping is a possibility that can befall all sexual desire it stands as a possibi lity for each of us We must 89 THE PHilOSOPHY Of FOUCAULT al l be protected nor only against perverse adu lts themselves bur also against rhe perverse adul t rhar lies in wait wirhin each of us One can see here rhe soi l wirhin which Freudian psychoanalysis will rake roar Finally rhere is rhe Malthusian couple This is rhe couple rhar is ideal relative ro the social and economic needs of society It is a product of population analysis and psychosexual research We might say in rhe terms intra duced in Discipline and Punish rhar the Malrhusuan couple is the norm as in normal against wh ich all existing fam ilies are compared And since nobody or almost nobody ach ieves perfect normality the Malthusian couple becomes the justification for intervention into peoples sexual lives We all exist both in the shadow of and at a d isrance from rhe ideal of the Malthusian couple which in turn provides both an ideal for us ro achieve and the excuse for outside institutions ro monitor and control our sexual lives or otherwise pur ro rake parr in the consriturion of and intervention into who we are In rhe final chapter of the first volume of his history of sexua liry Fou caulr suggests rhar the sexual ity rhar emerges over the course of rhe eighteenth and nineteenth centuries is parr of a larger configuration rhat he rerms biopolitics Biopolirics is a politics of living rhar concerns itself wirh how to promote and intervene in human life It replaces the earl ier concern with simply allowing one to live with an active intervention into the character and srare of ones living One might say that the ancient righ t ro take life or let live was replaced by a power ro foster life or disallow ir ro the point of death HS 138 We must be clear here rhar the power rhar replaces that ancient right does nor belong solely or even primari ly ro the stare It arises as a more diffuse mechanism of power relations rhar come from d ispersed sources and converge in a fluid and shift ing unity The fostering or disallowing of life is a decision that is rarely made in the name of or by means of a central government It emerges in schools hospitals social agencies cl inics doctors offices health manuals and a myriad of other places whose decisions may resonate with one another bur do nor arise from a central core With the concept of biopolirics Foucault returns ro and integrates his ea rlier treatment of discipl ine He suggests rhar discipline may be one of the rwin poles of the consrirurion of biopo lirics starring in rhe seventeenth century this power over life evolved in rwo basic forms    One of these poles   was ensured by the pro cedures of power that characterized the disciplines an anatamopolitics of the human bod The second somewhat larer focused on rhe species body the body imbued with the mechanisms of life and serving as the basis of the biological processes   T heir 90 GENEALOGICAl HISTORIES OF WHO WE ARE supervision was effected through an enrire series of inrervenrions and regulatory controls a biopolitics of the population HS 139 Discip line and population the individual body and the co llective group T hese are the po les of biopo lirics What do the body and population have in common Sexual iry Sexualiry then can be read back inro some of the concerns developed in the earlier book on the prisons T his does nor mean rhar the earlier book is mistaken rhar the issue is really sex nor discipl ine The suggestion rather is that the concern with sex brings a new dimension to the discipl inary interventions described in the earlier text Ye can see the ove rlap between the two the focus on normality and normalization the concern with a persons interioriry the soul in one case desire in the other the connection with psychological and psychiatric practice During this period of his writing Foucault often says that his concern is with what he calls in a play on words subjectification or stbjectivation the creation of particular kinds of subjectivity through the subjection to various practices of powerknowledge What the books on discipl ine and sex accomplish is to describe from two different bur convergenr angles the emergence of modern subjecriviry In that sense these books reflect the genealogical method itself Just as each describes dispersed sources of the un ities of who we are they are themselves dispersed sources in that history Taken together they account for two of the most important dispersions that form the historically contingenr sources for who we are now Before turn ing to Foucaults last works and the concerns they ra ise it remains for us to ask how the genealogical works we have d iscussed here fit with the five aspects of Foucaults writings cited in the first chapter and how they compare on these counrs wi th the archaeological writings The first aspect is that of our collective constitution One can see that aspect at work in the genealogical writings perhaps even more clearly than in the archaeo logical ones Although both sets of works operate at the level of social practices rather than the individuals creation of themselves the genealogical works show how this collective constitution arises on an everyday level Because the genea logical works are less abstracted from our daily lives they show how a we or a group olf differenr bur overlapping wes arises not by imposition from instinttions or forces above us bur from below where we live Earlier we saw that the archaeological works although recognizing relations between the d iscursive and nondiscursive elements of an arch ive seem to privilege the former T his privi lege disappears in the genealogical works in part because the distinction between the discursive and nondiscursive itself disappears Since Foucault is concerned less with the 91 THE PHilOSOPHY O f FOUCAULT archival shape of theoretical d iscourses and more with how particular discourses of knowledge arise within concrete social practices the issue shifts It is no longer a matter of the relation of the discursive to the nondiscursive It is one of how practices create forms of knowledge Vhen one discusses a practice one need not draw sharp d istinctions between the discursive and the nondiscursive elements because at the level of a practice they are entwined Vhat we think we know and what we do are in constant interaction and in fact bleed into each other By focusing on practices rather than on bodies of knowledge one can recognize this more clearly We can see this for example with the emergence of the four figures of sexual ity or of the selfmon itoring citizen of the disciplinary archipelago In both cases the way one knows and the way one is and behaves are entwined Our knowledge creates who we are and who we are in our relarionshi ps of power helps to create our knowledge This of course is another of the five characteristics of Foucaults works the close relationship of acting and knowing Genealogys focus on practices as well as the introduction of powerknowledge creates a type of analysis that renders the discursive and the nondiscursive inseparable At the same rime because these practices are social they form the collective character of who vre are This collective and pol itically charged character of who we are is at once historically contingent and something we cannot just shake off The historical contingency is as strong here as it is in the archaeological works but for a different reason In the earl ier writings the fragility of our history is displayed in the breaks and discontinuities it contains Different arch ives are governed by different rules and norms and there are often shifts from one arch ive to another T his shifting of archi ves blunts the force of any claim that history follows necessary movement or has a single underlying theme In the genealogical works it is nor so much the discontinuities that matteralthough they are there  but rather the sh ifting and changing character of the practices themselves as well as their complex interplay with one another 16 T here is no necessary reason that sex should become so important to who we are now any more than breathing or eat ing The intersection of a changed Cathol ic confessional and the rise of population studies for example cannot be ascribed to an underlying movement of history that they both reflect T he Reformation does not have to ralke place in the way and at the rime it does and even if it had to Catholicism does nor need to respond to it by focusing the confessional on sexual desires rather than forbidden acts At the same rime the rise of early capitalism does nor require the emergence and importance of population studies Capitalism could be studied and supported through other types of ep istemological approaches Further the crossfertilization of the modified confessional and population 92 GENEALOGICAL HISTORIES OF WHO WE ARE studies does nor have to centre itself on a historically constituted sexual ity Even if both refer rosex they do so in d ifferent ways There is no historical inevitability to their coming together to form a unury Ye can see this historical contingency more clearly through the derailed approach of genealogy than through a more broadbrushsrroke painting of history and historical change Recall Foucaults depiction of genealogy grey meticu lous and patien tly documentary From a great distance or height our history may seem to have a necessary shape or pattern However when one begins to look at the complexity of our actual practices when one approaches our lives at ground level the contingency of those practices emergence and interaction becomes more visible At the same rime and on the other hand the uniti es that emerge through the contingent threads of our history fragile as they are are nor simply to be shaken off Ye have seen that in the archaeological histories the fact that action rakes place in an arch ive means that actions are framed by their historical circumstances Tuke and Pinel cannot just do and say anything they like what they do and say is both constrained by and rakes on irs meaning through the circumstances in which it is done and said The genealogical works are no different in this regard However by introducing the concept of power Foucaults genealogies are more expl icit about the constra ining nature of our practices Actions that affect other act ions are inescapably actions that we cannot simply shake off One need not embrace a conspiracy theory of history to recognize that who we are is subject to force or elements or relationships that to a greater or lesser extent are our of our control This does nor imply as some of Foucaults critics have maintained that we are helpless before our historical constitution that we are nothing more than the machinations of power re lationsh ips Ye have already seen that the claim that power is everywhere does nor imply that it is everything One of the difficulties in understanding Foucaults work is that of thinking of contingency and constraint roger her This is nor a d ifficulty that belongs to some abstract or elusive facer of Foucaults work It is just something we are nor used to Our intellecruallegacy largely provides us with rwo options either we are free or we are determined Or if we are more nuanced about it we have our areas of freedom and our areas of determination The former is an open space untouched by the causal relationships of the world The latter is completely subject to those causal relationsh ips Foucaults histories do nor subscribe to this view There is no parr of us that is immune to the vicissirudes of our history And yet those vicissirudes are nor made of iron They are fragi le contingent changeable Foucault as we have seen does nor give us a solution to the philosophical problem of free will and determinism Moreover his approach implies a different orientation to the issue of constraint There is then no reason to saddle him 93 THE PHILOSOPHY Of FOUCAULT with a view he does nor hold in the name of a theoretical approach that is nor his There remains the characteristic of complexily Genealogy leaves the ambiguity of archaeologys relation to complexity behind Foucaults archaeological studies trace the rules and norms o f particular archives This leaves open the question of how general the arcl ive is Does it range over an entire cu ltural formation or is ir more limited  If ir is the former then historical formations are less complex than if there are d ifferent arch ives governing d ifferent areas of a society or a cu lture Is ordered representation or reason s treatment of madness as folly a deep characteristic of the classical age Do these aspects of the classical age describe that age in irs entirety Or are they aspects or parts or areas of the ep istemological structure of the later seventeenth and eigh teenth centuries Migh t there be other knowledges outside those of the theories of value living beings and language that are nor oriented around ordered representation Might the particular type of reason that engages with madness be only one way in which reason operates T hese are questions that are ultimately unresolved in Foucaults archaeological works Nor so wi th genealogy Although there are ri mes when Foucault may seem ro suggest a reduction of cu ltural complexity ro single themes some for instance have read his concept of the carceral arch ipelago to ind icate rhar the essence of modernity is carceral a carefu l read ing shows that each book treats an aspect of how we have come to be who we are now nor the entirety of it Are we disciplinary beings Yes Are we sexual beings Yes Is there a relation between these rwo Yes Are they reducible to each other or to a third unity that encompasses them both No Foucaults genealogical works even more insistently than his archaeologies resist the temptation of much of trad itional philosophy of the ph ilosophy that runs from Descartes through ro Freud and Sarrre to discover the essential core of who we are and to see the rest of who we are as expressions of that core There are certainly more important aspects of who we are now and sexual ity and discipline are among them Nor every aspect of who we have come robe is an equa lly significant contributor ro rhar being We must nor rake the lesson of this however to be that there are one or rwo aspects of who we are now that are the essential ones The complexity of Foucaults approach lies in carving a path between posing an essential ahisrorical core of who we are and counting all aspects of our legacy as equally worthy of discussion T here is another question that remains one we have posed to the archaeological writings The archaeologies are haunted by a question of reflexivity a question having to do with their epistemological status VIe can summarize the question this way if all knowledge takes place in an archive 94 GENEALOGICAL HISTORIES OF WHO WE ARE does this nor also app ly ro Foucaults archaeologies and if so does that nor somehow undermine their claims However we answer this question with regard to archaeology it is nor a question genealogy must confront The reason for this has to do with genealogys re lation to complexity If there are many different and irreducible practices in which we are or could be engaged we can count genealogy itself as one of them Genealogy has irs own norms and power relations ro be sure bur this does nor necessarily undermine the historical claims it makes Foucault underlines this point when in an interview in 1983 he responds to a question about his treatment of reason by saying I think that the blackmail which has very ofren been at work in every critique of reason or every critical inqu iry into the history of rationality either you accept rationality or you fall prey to the irrat ional operates as though a rational critique of rationality were impossible or as though rational history of all of rhe ramifications and all the bifurcations a contingent history of reason were impossible CT IH 27 17 Recall how genealogy operates in the critique of psychology that arises in the book on the prisons Foucault does nor criticize psychological knowledge for being fa lse In fact parr of irs t ruth lies in the fact that it contributes to creating what it studies The problem with psychological knowledge lies in irs effects nor irs truth in the political character of what it creates rather than in the episremic character of irs claims With genealogy then if we were to ask genealogical questions about its claims if we were to do a genealogy of genealogy or a genealogy of a parricullar genealogy we would trace the emergence and descent of that genealogy asking where it comes from and what the endorsement of it leads to There is no bar ro doing this as long as one is willing to perform the spade work T hat is one cannot just say that genealogy has effects of power that are unacceptable or intolerable One must show it one must investigate the history itself Recall Foucaults caveat with his own history of sexual ity he does nor yet know whether beyond these few phosophorescences he will discover that the repressive hypothesis is indeed correct It will require historical research to determine T he same holds for genealogy Genealogy then does nor face the problem of reflexivity that haunts archaeo logy because it does nor reduce knowledge to a particular archive and because it does nor claim that the objects of its critique are false It is open to critique itself bur that critique must be shown nor just claimed A critique of a Foucauldian genealogy if it is to be compelling must itse lf be grey metiwlous and patiently documentary 95 CHAPTER FOUR Who we are and who we might be The Archaeology of Knowledge is published in 1969 Between 1961 and 1969 Foucault publishes six books He does nor publish another one until the first genealogy appears in 1975 followed by the first volume of the history of sexuality a year later By then there are new themes such as power and a new methodo logy that of genea logy The first volume on sex promises several more to follow The domain we must analyze in the different studies that will follow the present volume is that deployment of sexual ity irs formation on the basis of the Christian notion of the flesh and irs development through the four great strategies that were deployed in the nineteenth century the sexual ization of ch ildren the hysrerizarion of women the specification o f the perverted and the regulation of populations HS 113  14 In 1984 the second and third volumes are published They appear just before Foucaults death And in them there are new themes a new chronology and a new approach an approach that Foucaul t sometimes labels ethics Ethics We already know that Foucault is resistant to pa1iroll ing the same intellectual territory He has to ld us in The Archaeology of Knowledge that it is nor for him to keep his papers in order bur for bureaucrats and the police He says much the same thing in his preface to the second volume of the history of sexuality The Use of Pleasure when he tells us that what motivated him 96 WHO WE ARE AND WHO WE MIGHT BE is a curiosity that al lows him to stray afield of himself We shall ask more about the character of this straying later For now it is enough that we nor demand of him that he keep to the original schedule of announced works In the meantime between the publication of the first volume of the history of sexuality and the latter two volumes the evidence of a change in orientat ion appears in his annual lecture series at the Col lege de France Instead of beginning the investigation in the period of the Renaissance or postRenaissance a period that has always been Foucaults starring point Foucault turns his attention to ancient Greece and Rome The 1979 80 lectures series On the Government of the Living discusses the theme of governmentality a prominent theme of the next chapter of this book as he finds it in early Chrisrian iry Bur the real break appears the next year in a series of lectures entitled Subjectivity and Truth  It is in those lectures wh ich are the basis for the third volume of the history of sexual iry that he develops the theme that will occupy the eth ical period of his thought the care of the self The care of the self involves several changes to the project on sexual iry First irs concern is nor simply with sex This should nor be surprising given the thesis of the first vo lume that sexuality as the placement of sexual desire at the centre of who one is has evolved over recent centuries Sexualiry is nor an eternal phenomenon By returning to ancient Greece and Rome Foucault shows us a period in which sex is conceived d ifferently from the way it is now It is more integrated into other aspects of living Instead of ho ld ing the secret to who we are sex is a parr of ones living For the ancients it is an aspect that is to be taken up into the larger project of taking care of oneself This first change is related to a second one In Foucaults previous works he traces aspects of the history of how we have come to be who we are now He starts with historical periods before our own in order to show in the archaeo logical works the ruptures that have taken place and in the genealogical works the contingent emergence of our own situation from a very different one We might say that the history he recounts allows him to do two things one that we have focused on and another that we have nor ie have focused on the contingency of historical emergence We have nor focused on the related idea that people can conceive the world very differently from the way we do now That history did nor have to rake the path it has should by now be a fami liar Foucauldian id ea In tracing that path we have also seen that the stops along rhe way whether they are archives or earlier arrangements of practices invo lve very different approaches to things like madness and punishment than our own  W hy might this matter Of course one might say people saw things differently in earlier periods What is the lesson o f that The lesson emerges when we combine that idea wi th the recognition that the way people see 97 THE PHilOSOPHY O f FOUCAULT things and indeed the way people are is historically contingent If we do nor have to see things the way we once did if we d o nor have to be who we once were then we do nor have to be who we are now Bringing into focus different ways of being allows us nor only ro see the contingency of our own historically given ways of being it allows us to feel ir Being brought into the presence of another way of living getting a sense of irs themes irs parameters irs concerns allows us to understand more viscerally that there are indeed other ways to live than our own T his does nor mean we have to embrace those other ways Bur they can help loosen the grip of naturalness that the present has upon us The loosening of this grip is in evidence in the latter rwo volumes on sexual ity If their goal is to permit our straying afield of ourselves then seeing how we could have lived otherwise is a tool in this permission We should distinguish this tool from another one that is sometimes mistaken for Foucaults intention Foucault does not offer us the latter two volumes of the history of sexual ity in order to provide models for our own living lr is sometimes though t that the sympathy with which he writes particularly of Greek sexual ity implies that he wants us to return to it  I suspect that this view arises largely because of the intersection of Foucaul ts homosexual ity with the Greeks tolerance for it In an exchange in an interview from 1983 Foucault makes it clear that the Greeks do nor provide a model for him Q Do you think that the Greeks offer an attractive and plausible alternative MF No I am not looking for an al ternative yon cant find the so lution of a problem in the solution at another moment by other people OGE 343 If Foucaults later studies focus on a different view of the role of sex from our own and if they seek to loosen the grip our own views have on us by immersing us in another view then this implies a third change a shift in orientation in Foucaults thought Up until now we have said that the question that occupies Foucault is that of who we are now In presenting us with ways of seeing and living very different from our own however he changes the question T he ancient Greeks and Romans are not who we are now Moreover while our history has evolved from their legacy although nor in a continuous thread what Foucault emphasizes in his later studies in contrast to the genealogical works is not their legacy to us but their difference rom us It is not how the specific practices of the Greeks and Romans converge with other practices in order to form who we are that matters here Rather it is how d istant they are from our practices rhar is ar issue This re location of focus has an impact on the question of who we are Ar first glance we mighr say rhar ir shifts rhe concern from who we are now ro who we once were Bur rhar is not enough As Foucault rells us he is nor interested simply in knowing who we were H is research is never simply an academic exercise The stakes here concern freedom rhey concern st raying 98 WHO WE ARE AND WHO WE MIGHT BE afield of ourselves The object was to learn to what extem the effort to think ones own history can free thought from what it silently thinks and so enable it to think differently UP 9 So the shift is not the simple one from who we are to who we were It is bener schematized in this way it is from who we are now to who we might be Ye must be carefu l here though Who we might be is not provided directly by the model of the anciems Although there will be themes in the anciem approach to living that Foucault endorses particu larly concerning the idea of the care of the self as an aesthetics of existence the anciems do not provide us with a concrete alternative Rather smdying them loosens the grip our presem has upon us It allows us not only to conceive bur imaginatively to inhabit a differem way of living It opens the door to our asking the questcon of who we might be Alongside these three changes there are a number of cominuities with the earlier works One of them is of particular momem Foucaults attemion remains focused on practices on the strucmred forms of da ily living If he writes abou t philosophers like Plato and Seneca it is with a d ifferent orientat ion from the one the history of ph ilosophy has passed down to us He is not interested in the anciems as theorists he is imerested in them as practit ioners of what might be cal led true living To live r ightly to live according to proper trmhs is the task of anciem philosophers rather than one of simply discovering the truth In this Foucault fol lows his comemporary the ph ilosopher of amiqu iry Pierre Hadot to whom we will remrn Bm he also remains faithful to his earl ier genealogical orientation of looking on the ground at the practices that make up a life rather t han ascending to a more purely theoretica l plane If looking backwards from our perspective we see philosophy as a matter of discovering trmhs rather than orieming ourselves towards the proper care of the self this is because we have lost the anciem approach to ph ilosophy and with it the understanding of what anciem phi losophers were doing In his lecture series of 1981 82 The Hermeneutics of the Subject Foucault says the more serious reason why this precept of the care of the self has been forgotten the reason why the place occupied by this precept in anciem culture for nigh on one thousand years has been obliterated is what I will call  the Cartesian momem    It came into play in two ways by philosophically requalifying the gnothi seauton know yourself and by d iscrediting the epimeeia heautou care of the self  HSLCF 14 Although the care of the self dropped our of phi losophical d iscourse knowing oneself wh ich had been oriemed towads the care of the self 99 THE PHilOSOPHY O f FOUCAULT became a matter of determining the conditions of a persons access to truth Instead of mainraining itself as what Foucault sometimes ca lls a spiritual project philosophical practice gradually transformed itself inro an epistemological one What is the care of the self What is irs character and what makes ir a philosophical matter Foucaults most sustained trearmenr of this concept is in the recenrly published lectures from which the above quote is drawn In those lectures Foucault traces the change in orienrarion of the care of the self from Plato through Hellenic thought especially that o f the Stoics and rhe Epicureans Vhat underlies Foucaults concern is the relation of what he calls the subject and truth  This relation of subject and truth is a lens through which we can if we li ke read the enrirery of Foucaults writings The archaeological work is a matter of rhe subjects episremic placemenr in an arch ive By placing the subject of knowledge in an archive Foucault rejects the phenomenological t radition that he was brought up in and that his earl iest writings susta in In phenomenology the subjects relation to truth is more immediate It is a matter of being able to see perspicuously almost in the sense of Descartess clear and d istinct perception what needs to be grasped The inrerference of history politics or language can all be overcome according ro the phenomenological view However if knowledge is inescpably located within the rules and norms of an archive if iris always historically bounded then the possibi lity of a subjects immediate relation ro truth is lost The relation of subject to truth runs through the arch ive Genealogy mainrains the same rejection of phenomenology and adds a political dimension to the historical one W hat one knows is nor a matter of a pure seeing or grasping rather ir concerns a series of pol itical relationships in which truth  or at least claims ro truth  is embedded Of course Foucaults concern has never been w ith all areas of truth He does not treat natural sciences such as physics and chemistry The truth rhar concerns him has ro do with what he sometimes calls the human sciences Psychology linguistics economics medicine psychoanalysis biology these are the areas of truth rhar form Foucaults target We might say that ir is nor a matter of subjects relation to rrurh bur rl1eir relation to their own truth rhar lies at the core of Foucaults inreresr O r to put ir in the terms we are using here the issue is subjects relation to who they are or ro who they are now and as a part of this to who they rake themselves to be This is what makes Foucaul ts discovery of the ancienr care of the self fascinating ro him T he care of the self involves a differenr relation of the subject to irs own truth  The care of the self whether Platonic Hellenistic or early Christian requires one ro work on oneself in a way rhar transforms who one is It is nor simply truth bur oneself rhar is at stake And in 100 WHO WE ARE AND WHO WE MIGHT BE particular with Hellenistic thought the care of the self involves a lifelong commirmenr ro selfcreat ion ro gerring free of who one is so rhar one can become something else Knowledge of the self at this level at least is nor then on the way to becoming the deci phermenr of the mysteries of conscience and the exegesis of the self which develops in later Christianity Useful knowledge knowledge in which human life is at stake is a relat ional mode of knowledge that asserts and prescribes at the same rime and is capable of producing a change in the subjects mode of being HSLCF 238 If we compare this idea with Foucaults own project of philosophy as allowing one to stray afield of oneself the importance of the care of the self becomes evidenr In both cases rhe relation of subject ro truth is nor epistemological It is practical practica l nor in the sense of Kanrs moral law nor in the everyday sense of helping navigate ones world smoothly In many ways it is the opposite of the larrer sense of the practical The care of the self requires one ro jettison ones normal relation ro the practical world in favour of one that fai ls to conform to the expectations that are the web of that world The care of the self and Foucaults stray ing afield are practical because they are both marrers of practice in rwo senses of rhar word First they are marrers of how one relates to and engages in the social practices of which one is a part They are nor merely projects of thought they are projects of living Secondly to take care of oneself or to stray afield of oneself requires practice lr requ ires a vigilant arrenrion to who one is being made to be by the society around one and an often renewed commirmenr ro become otherwise The ancienrs often engaged in what Pierre Hadar calls spiritual exercises in which one repeats a variety of philosophical formulas to oneself in order to keep reminding oneself of who one wanrs to be and of the forces that are arrayed against ones achieving ir Marcus Aurelius for instance often reminds himself in his Meditations that he will soon be dead and forgotten so that he might stop lusting after fame Caring for onese lf and straying afield of oneself are not simply produas of a single ep iphany They requ ire constanr practice and renewed commitmenr If the relation of subject to truth is in some ways common to both Foucault and the ancients so is the goal of philosophical practice Ir is in both cases a certain freedom a freedom that involves abandon ing some of the norms that govern the society in which one finds oneself in favour of a vision of a better way of living 101 THE PHILOSOPHY OF FOUCAULT We should nor however interpret Foucaults project as identical to that of the Stoics or of the ancients genera lly There are important differences between Foucaults idea and that o f the ancient philosophers particularly regarding the character of the freedom one seeks to exercise Among the most important is that for the ancients there are proper ways to live and the care of the self is required in order to achieve rhem Foucault writes in a much later period one in which the idea of essentially proper ways to live is foreign to many and certain ly to him So the care of the self is d ifferently oriented It is not in the service of a right way of I iving a way of living that would for the ancients be inscribed in the larger cosmic order Rather it is in service of bringing reflective thought to bear on what one might make of oneself One cares for oneself in the sense of having it matter what one can make of oneself who one can create oneself to be In an interview during this period of his work Foucault comments that W hat st rikes me is the fact that in our sociery art has become something that is related only to objects and not to ind ividuals or to life That art is something special ized which is done only by experts who are artists Bur couldn t everyones life become a work of art Why should the lamp or the house be an art object bur nor life OGE 350 This view could not be expressed by a Stoic or a Platon ic philosopher It orients the care of the self in a direction different from that of the ancients bur at the same rime it reveals a ph ilosophical approach that concerns itself not with conditions of truth bur with forms of living In the lectures on the care of the self Foucault contrasts three paths for caring for oneself that arise in the ancient world There is the Platonic path exemplified in the d ialogue Alcibiades where Socrates advises the young Alcibiades to know himself in the sense of discovering or recall ing who he is There is the Hellenistic path in which caring for oneself is a confrontation wi th and modification of who one is And finally there is the Christian path which asks one ultimately not to modify bu t to renounce onese lf In the second volume of the history of sexuality publlished two years later than the lectures on the care of the self Foucault turns his attention to the ancient Greek form that the care of the self rakes Here the framework is wider than that of the Platonic path described in the lectures And yet it follows the lectures in irs emphasis on three areas dietetics economics and erotics a lthough it adds a fourth area on the re lation to truth  In the lectures Foucault tells us with regard to letters of Marcus Aurelius The body the fami ly circle and household love Dietetics economics and erorics These are the three major domains in which the practice of the self is actualized in 102 WHO WE ARE AND WHO WE MIGHT BE this period with as we see constant crossreferencing from one to the other HS 161 Two years later this division is read back from the Stoics into the Greeks as the framework for the proper construction of a life Foucault offers a rich description of ancient wri tings concerning these three areas Before ttrning to them he imroduces a term that does not appear in the lecwres bm char frames the enquiry problematization Although he does not define the term one can get a sense of it from the passage in which he introduces it It is often the case that the moral soliciwde is strong precisely where there is neither obligation or prohibition In other words the interdiction is one thing the moral problematization is another It seemed to me therefore that the question that ought to guide my inquiry was the following how why and in what forms was sexuality constitmed as a moral domain Why this ethical concern that was so persistent despite its varying forms and intensity Why this problematization UP 10 Vhat is a problematization Foucault contrasts problematizations with obligations prohibitions and interdictions The latter three terms will be familiar to us from their role in currem moral thinking We tend to consider the moral realm precisely as one of obligations and prohibitions We might say that we think of the moral realm as divided into three areas the prohibited the permitted and the required There are to be sure gradations within them For instance there are acts that are permitted bm discouraged or forbidden except under certain exceptional circumstances Bm the broad framework is one of d isallowances allowances and requ tremems However much of the normative intervention imo peoples lives and behaviours does not fall under this simple rubric If moral theory is a matter of sharp d ivisions the practice of living is more often a matter of problematizations Ve might say at a first go that problematizations occur regarding those areas of life that are considered problematic For an area of life to be problematic is not for it to be a problem as in a problem to be overcome Rather it is for that area of life to be fraugh t Instead of prohibitions there are dangers Instead of obligations there are opportunities Instead of allowances there are multiple ways these dangers and opporruni ties can be navigated Like our traditional conception of the moral realm a problematic realm and in Foucaults view much of the moral realm is in fact a problematic one is normatively laden But those norms have less to do with the question of whether and more with the question of how And 103 THE PHILOSOPHY Of FOUCAULT correlatively they are less concerned with ind ividual behaviours and more with realms of life Foucaults earlier works have prepared us for this idea As he tells us in the second volume There was the problemarizarion of madness and illness arising our of social and medical practices and defining a certain parrern of normalization a problematizarion of life language and labor in discursive practices that conformed to certain epistemic rules and a problemarizarion of crime and crimina l behavior emerging from certain punitive practices conforming to a disciplinary model UP 12 We must always be carefu l when Foucault reads his earlier works in light of his later projects He often reinterprets what he has done in light of his current project Here however the idea of problematizarion caprures an aspect of the trajectory of his work Much of w ho we are is consriru red nor by allowances and prohibitions bur by norms embedded in practices that determine how we go about constructing w ho we are and what we know Foucaults work whether archaeological genealogical or ethical has a lways been a marrer of the historical investigation of norms that determine that construction One might want to object here that the introduction of the idea of a problemarization runs afoul of the concept of power Foucault develops in his genealogical works In Discipline and Punish for instance Foucault sees the operation of power undergoing a historical change Before the eighteenth century power operates on the binary model of the permirred and the forbidden It is on ly in the last two hundred years that a more nuanced type of power emerges one that can normalize or d iscipline subjects By seeing problematization in an a historical fashion by seeing it as something that concerns the ancients as well as the moderns is Foucault abandoning this view of power Is he saying that power has always been positive and creati ve as well as negative and restrictive Is he moving from a more historical view to a more essentialist one The situation may seem to be even worse for Foucault Nor only may the inrroducrion of the concept of problematizar ion have removed power from history it may even have inverted modern and premodern forms of power Our current moral conception is dominated by obl igations permissions and prohibitions Ancient morality as Foucault stresses is nor So it might seem that in fact the type of power associated with normalization and the d isciplines is more properly seen in ancient practices than in modern ones It is the moderns who operate by means of a repressive power whi le ancient practices create subjects through various problematizations 104 WHO WE ARE AND WHO WE MIGHT BE In replying to this objection we must first d istinguish our concept ion of morality from our practice of it Regarding power Foucault writes in the first volume of the history of sexual ity that One remains attached to a certain image of power law of powersovereignty which was traced out by the theoreticians of righ t and the monarchic institution  It is this image that we must break free of that is of the theoretical privilege of law a nd sovereignty if we wish to analyze power within the concrete and historical framework of its operation HS 90 The operation of power has changed but our conception o f it remains bound to earl ier models of its operation The same is true for morality Our practice of morality as Foucaults problematizations show is more complex than our r igid division of it into three areas This is why Foucault particularly in his works from 1975 on focuses on practices rather than on theories or better why he focuses on theories on ly in their role of arising out of and relating to practices Yet another worry might encroach here Foucault argues that our conception of ourselves on the one hand and who we are on the other cannot be divorced But in his view of power and my extension of this view to morality he seems to do precisely the opposite He says that our po litical and moral views do not reflect who we have come to be Is there a problem here No For Foucault our conception of who we are comes more from our practices than from political or ph ilosophical theory Who we are is a matter o f our practices Vho intellectuals think we are is o ften a matter of theories that although they are connecte d with certain practices in their own right are often connected with practices that have less to do with who we are than with an intellectual legacy that has more tenuous relations to the practices that actually determine us This does not mean that those theories are entirely divorced from who we are any more than the rise of a positive creative form of power has entirely disp laced the negative power theorized by those under the sway of powerassovereignty Vhat it means is that those theories have yet to grasp what is happening on the ground a grasp that Foucault turns to genea logy and then to eth ics to achieve W ith this in mind we can turn back to the initial worry that Foucaults introduction of the concept of problematization th reatens to undo the historical character of his conception of power In considering this objection we should first ensure that we have distinguished problematization from power They are not the same thing although indeed they are related Where problematization occurs there is indeed the possibil ity of a power 105 THE PHILOSOPHY Of FOUCAULT relat ionship of actions constra ining other actions W hat do we make of the idea then embraced by Foucault during his genealogical period that the operation of power is more negative and repressive in premodern Europe and more positive and creative which bear in mind does not mean better in modern Europe I believe there is a shift here in Foucaults thought but it is less stark than it may appear Problematization does open the door to a power that creates subjectivity but there are limits to its abi lity to do so that are bound by the technology and social state of the ti mes Recall that in order to monitor populations in the way that biopower seeks to t here must be certain economic conditions in place there must be concentrations of people and there must be the abil ity to collect in formation across populations Or again in order to discipline a larger group of people one must have the technology to monitor that group Vhat makes negative repressive power more prominent in premodern societies is perhaps among other things the inability to engage in certain forms of control that many types of positive creative power require This does not mean that there is no creative power in ancient practices a point that Foucaults later studies do not deny To be sure Foucault does not consider power in his d iscussion of the care of the self In an interview from 1984 Foucault has this exchange Q T hus there has been a sort of shift these games of truth no longer involve a coercive practice but a practice of selfformation of the su bject MF Thats right It is what one could call an ascetic practice taking asceticism in a very general sense  in other words not in the sense of a morality of renunciation but as an exercise of the self on the self by which one attempts to develop and transform oneself and to attain to a certain mode of being EC 282 Here the distinction Foucault allows the interv iewer to makes seems at least to me too rigid It is not that the games of truth involving the care of the self do not concern power Rather it is that power is not the focus of Foucaults analysis There can be power in the way one is asked to care for oneself Problematizations open up certain paths and d iscourage others they involve actions upon actions that contribute to creating certain ways of being However the power that inheres in these practices and that does help create its subjects may not have the same coercive force as later forms of creative power that require more technological advancement and d ifferent economic conditions 106 WHO WE ARE AND WHO WE MIGHT BE In the pre face to the second volume of the history of sexuality where Foucault d iscusses the change in his approach from the one originally omlined in the first vo lume he seems to see problematization as more closely entwined with power To speak of sexual ity as a historically singu lar experience a lso presupposed the availability of tools capable of analyzing the peculiar characteristics and interrelations of the three axes that constitute it 1 rhe formation of sciences saviors that refer to it 2 the systems o f power rhar regulate irs practice 3 the forms within which individuals are able are obliged ro recogn ize themselves as subjects of this sexual ity UP 4 T he first rwo axes are of course archaeology and genealogy The third axis is what requ ires a chronological reorientation because in order to accomplish ir Foucault believes he must analyze the practices by which individuals were led to focus their an ention on themselves ro decipher recogn ize and acknowledge themselves as subjects of desire ibid 5 Thinking of ethics and with it rhe issue of problemarizarions as an axis that intersects with the axes of archaeology and genealogy brings it in closer contact with power This in turn allows that power even creative power can be an aspect of ancient forms of problematization This is where there is I think a sh ift in Foucaults thought It is where power as a creative and not merely repressive force can appear in ancient practices of living But the sh ift is one of emphasis not an overturning of a historical view of power Foucaul t does not say that rhe creati ve power he d escribes in the genealogical works is nonexistent in the premodern period Rather ir emerges as the dominant form of power the one most in need of analysis By introducing the concept of problematization by ascribing it a place in all his works and by seeing ir as an axis that intersects with power he o pens the door to a recogn ition that d ifferent types of creative power can occur in different time periods Yet by the same token he can also say rhar the more urgent forms of rhar power are the more recent ones for economic po litical and technological reasons Foucault does nor say any of this because he does nor address the problem However it is a perspective that allows us ro see both the continuity and discontinuity of rhe later project with the earl ier ones W ith this view of problematizations in hand we can ask how the problematization that emerges among the ancients relative to sex occurs As Foucault has emphasized sex in the ancient world is not yet what he would call sexuality lr does not yet stand as the secret key to open the mysteries of who one is it is not the centrepiece of ones identity Rather it is embedded 107 THE PHILOSOPHY Of FOUCAULT in a larger ethical realm the realm of the care of the self What is this realm like What makes something an ethical matter If we are to understand the ancient care of the self we need to know in general what ethical space looks li ke and then more specifically how that space is filled by ancient practices Foucaul t isolates four elements of the ethical the eth ical substance the mode of subjection the ethical work and the relos Together they form the framework of eth ics or more generally of any moral practice On this view moral theories of the type we have already discussed those that focus on obligations and prohibitions would find their place within the larger realm of eth ical problemarization The ethical substance is this or that parr of himself that the ind ividual must determine as the prime material of his moral conduct UP 26 Over the course of history different ethical substances have been determined For instance many modern ph ilosophers believe that behaviour is the ethical substance For others like Kant the ethical substance is the will  It need nor be either of these however It can be rhe soul or desire or the emotions or passions T he mode of subjection the French here is mode dassujettisement which can be t ranslated as mode of subjection or mode of subjecrificarion becoming subject to or becoming a subject  and Foucault probably has both meanings in mind is  the way in which the ind ividual establishes his relation to the rule and recognizes himself as obliged to pur it in practice UP 27 For instance if I en list to fight in a war my country has declared I can do so for many reasons I can en list because  believe it is my duty as a citizen o f the country to protect it I can enl ist because I owe it to my fami ly to protect them alternatively my enl istment can come from my sense that the country we are fighting poses a threat to a larger world order that must be maintained or that to refuse to fight might endanger the lives of innocent people whom I have never mer but to whom I am morally obliged In al l these possibilities lies the question of my relation to what is asked of me and in that re lation I estab lish myself as a particular kind of ethical subject The ethical work is the work that one performs on oneself nor only in order to bring ones conduct into compl iance with a given rule bur to attempt to transform oneself into the eth ical subject of ones behavior ibid If in the mode of subjection one establishes how the ethical has a hold on one in the ethical work one realizes that hold through what one does Suppose I decide that my moral net ought to be cast more widely than I have previously thought I am obliged nor only to people I care about bur also to those I have nor mer but who are suffering in their own right How might I establish myself as the kind of person who exhibits this obligation I might read novels about people in other culmres who are undergoing forms of deprivation that do nor affect people I know Alternatively I 108 WHO WE ARE AND WHO WE MIGHT BE might travel ro some of these cultures Yet again I may decide that I do nor need ro experience their suffering bur instead ro su brracr parr of my weekly paypacker and give it to an organization that deals with poverty in foreign countries All of these methods are modes of ethical work The last element of the ethical framework is the relos An action is nor on ly moral in itself in irs singularity it is also moral in irs circumstantial integration and by virtue of the place it occupies in a pattern of conduct ibid 278 The relos we might say is the point of moral conduct Is one to conduct oneself morally in order to become a certain kind of individual And if so what kind A person o f reason as Kant would have it A man of selfmastery as will be the case for the ancient Greeks A person o f virtue Or is the point of moral conduct instead to contribute to a certain kind of world as the uti litarians wou ld have it In each case there is an ethical vision involved a goal towards which the instances of conduct that establish or express certain relations ro a particular ethical substance are d irected That goal is rhe ethical relos Together these elements form the framework of ethical action As Foucault notes in all of these there are matters of conduct and practices of se lfformation Modern moral views rend to emphasize the conduct over the selfformation wh ile the ancients rend in the other direction For instance modern moral philosophers more often think of the ethical work in terms of what one does to accomplish moral goals than in terms of who one becomes by the conduct one engages in In that way there can arise the emphasis on the permitted and the forbidden that seems to many ro be the heart of modern ethics If Foucaults characterization of the eth ical is right however that emphasis rakes place within a larger framework of practice that has other elements that are formative of ethica l subjects bur that may not be theorized as clearly Otherwise put ethical practice may outrun ethical theory just as certain modern practices of power lie beyond the theories of power meant to account for powers operation Ethics In Ancient Greece If this is the general shape of ethical space or alternatively of the historical trajectory of ethical problemarizarion then we are prepared ro ask what that shape looks like for the ancients In parricula Foucault is concerned with that shape as it bears upon sex Sex is nor in itself a separate problematic area in ancient living an area wi th irs own particular ethical problematizarion Rather it is parr of the larger arena of pleasures of aphrodisia Foucault leaves the term aphrodisia un rranslared he uses it as 109 THE PHilOSOPHY Of FOUCAULT a term of art Broadly it has to do with pleasures associated with certain types of activity Not only sex but also food wine and relations with boys are activities associated with aphrodisia  What all these activities have in common is that they involve an intense pleasure one that could tempt a person roward excessive indulgence Excessive indu lgence in mrn upsets rhe narural order of living For the Greeks aphrodisiac pleasures are nor morally suspect in themselves as they will be larer for Christian practitioners but rhey are inferior The activities from which rhese pleasures arise are nor among rhe noble activities Aphrodisiac pleasures have a role in ones living but iris a secondary role The intensity of rhese pleasures however threatens co make them a primary focus of ones life Although rhey are secondary in rhe proper order of living rhey may become a primary focus of arrention It was jusr this acuteness of pleasure rogether with rhe anraction it exerrs on desire char caused sexual activity ro go beyond rhe limits char were ser by narure when she made the pleasure of rhe aphrodisia an inferior subord inate and conditioned pleasure Because of rhis intensity people were induced ro overrurn rhe hierarchy placing these apperires and rheir sat isfaction uppermost and giving them absolute power over rhe soun UP 49 How rhen is a person to approach rhe pleasures of aphrodisia of which sex is an element rather rhan rhe whole In Chrisrcan thoughr the approach will be centred on renunciation Aphrodisia will be associated with tempration and therefore with sin the erh ical relation co rhe pleasures of aphrodisia musr then become one of abandonment or barring rhar marginalization One can begin ro see here rhe birth of a conflicted anirude roward sex one rhar remains wirh us roday if sex involves a rainred pleasure bur is yet an unavoidable activity rhen indu lgence in ir is ar once necessary and indecent Necessary because of procreation indecent because of rhe inescapably impure pleasure ir enrails The Greek arcimde coward such pleasures is more measured Renunciation is nor the proper relarion ro rhem rather ir is knowing how and when to indulge Foucault iso lates rhree elements in rhe knowhow of ones proper relation co aphrodisiac pleasures need t imeliness and srams There is no shame in sex rhere is however a shame in overindulgence One needs ro engage moderately One should be guided in ones sexual relations as in one s cul inary acriviry and ones consumption of wine by need Vhere rhe need is not urgem one should refrain Thar way concrol remains wirh rhe subjeer of pleasures  the individual  and not wi th the pleasures themselves Again rhere are righr and wrong rimes co engage in rhe acriviries char yield 110 WHO WE ARE AND WHO WE MIGHT BE aphrodisia rimes of day rimes of the monrh rimes of the year Physicians in particular are concerned wi th understanding the proper rhythms of aphrodisiac indulgence Finally there is a concern with the status of those who indulge that is perhaps most foreign to us now Particularly in mens relations with boys issues of the class status of the partners the positions taken during sexual activity active or passive and the age of the parricipanrs become matters of reflection in order ro determine their proper levels and balance If moderation is the proper relation ro aphrodisia then the person who is capable of moderation is the person who can control his in the Greek case the ethics involved only concern men desires One must become a master of oneself One could behave ethical ly only by ad opting a combative attitude toward the pleasures   These forces could nor be used in the moderate way that was firring for them un less one was capable of opposing resisting and subduing them UP 66 This idea of mastery and particularly rhe image of barrie against pleasures may sound Christian Ir has a differenr inflection though In Christianity one masters these pleasures because they are ultimately robe renounced They are nor to be conrrolled bur to be in so far as possible abandoned As wil l later become the Christ ian and then Cartesian approach the pleasures of aphrodisia are pleasures of the body Since the body is immersed in sin one must seek ro overcome irs pleasures ro the exrenr rhar ir is in ones power to do so None of this characterizes the Greek approach ro mastery The pleasures of aphrodisia may be fraught they may be dangerous bur their dangers are nor matters of sin They are nor irremediably indecenr Instead the dangers of aphrodisia have ro do with upsetting the natural order of pleasures and activities Selfmastery does nor require renunciation Aphrodisia remains bur it remains under the cont rol of the subject of irs pleasures Foucault refers to images used ro describe this mastery for instance Platos image of the ream of horses wi th irs driver or Aristotles discussion of the ch ild in relation ro the adult It is not necessary to kill the horses or the child bur instead to ensure rhar they remain under ones direction and conrrol Vhar does this selfmastery yield  lr yields a sort of freedom Freedom is the goal of the ethical relation to aphrodisia This freedom is nor as we moderns may think either a freedom from deterministic forces or from political oppression It is a freedom in the self s relation to the self This individual freedom should nor  be understood as the independence of a free will  Irs polar opposite was nor a natural determinism nor was it the wi ll of an allpowerful agency it was enslavement  the enslavemenr of oneself by oneself UP 79 As Foucault poinrs our this freedom is virile in character It is active rather than passive and involves power rather than the mere absence of coercion 111 THE PHILOSOPHY Of FOUCAULT In this sense the Greek approach to freedom and selfmastery brings together two quali ties that often appear dissociated to us now viri lity and moderation We often think of virility as a matter of imposing ones will The virile man bends others to his desire Moderation on the other hand requires one to refrain rather than to impose Combined in rhe same person however viri lity and moderation become a mastery of self an imposing of ones will by means of moderating ones desires T his in Foucaults view is the Greek approach to ethics In this approach we can see the four elements of ethics Foucault cites The ethica l substance is aphrodisia It is that parr of the person that is the subject of ethical reflection and practice The mode of subjection is the knowinghow associated with need rime and srarus It forms what Foucault calls a type of saviorfaire instead of being a set of permissions and prohibitions it forms a sense of how to navigate among dangerous bur nor necessari ly impure desires The ethical work is the barde itself the t raining and effort required to bring the promised pleasures o f aphrodisia under ones control The relos is freedom Returning to themes from the 1982 lectures Foucault claims that the selfmastery sought by the ancient Greeks is al igned with a particular form of truth For Plato for instance in order to master oneself properly one has to know oneself to recollect who one is Again we should not confuse the philosophical relation to truth here with the relation that has come down to us through what Foucault calls  the Cartesian moment It is nor a matter of ep istemology of understanding the conditions of the subjects relation to knowledge It is a practical relation a relation to truth as one of the conditions for a person to achieve freedom The ancient relation to t ruth is subsumed under the larger project of the care of the self It is nor that the truth of things independent of oneself does nor matter Rather it is that that truth matters in as much as it bears on ones relation to oneself One of the current criticisms of contemporary phi losopby is that it concerns itself with matters that are of interest only to the specialist it is d ivorced from how we actually live Nor so ancient ph ilosophy in Foucaults view since the project of ancient phi losophy is nothing other than the articulation of proper ways to live In this relation to truth Foucault discovers what he calls an aesthetics of ex istence He contrasts this to the hermeneutics of desire o f later Christian pracuce Now whi le this relation to truth constitutive of the moderate subjeer did nor lead to a hermeneutics of desire it did on the other hand open onto an aesthetics of existence And what I mean by this is a way of life whose moral value did nor depend either on ones 112 WHO WE ARE AND WHO WE MIGHT BE being in conformity with a code of behavior or on an effort of purification bur on certain formal princip les in the use of pleasures in the way one disrribured them in the limits one observed in the hierarchy one respected UP 89 Ve can recall the hermeneuric of the self from the first volume of the history of sexuality There one learns to confess who one is in order to learn ones narure Cenrral to this is of course the confession of ones sexual desire In conrrast the truth of ancienr thought is bound not to a hermeneutics not to an inTerpretation of who one is through a reading of ones desire bur to the project of learn ing how to l ive One might ask here whether the hermeneutics of desire that Foucault discovers in Christianity is to be found in its earlier versions This would seem to be a revision of his view from the first volume where he sees it arising in response to the Reformation He does not address this issue bur I do not bel ieve a revision is necessary here The confessional is throughout irs history skewed towards even if not exactly a hermeneUTics Even when it is on ly a maner of saying what one does those doings are still ones own To confess them is to pur oneself before another in the context of the larger project of renunciation or purification Later when what is required is the confession of desire the hermeneutic character of the confessional becomes cenrral Bur the strucrure of the confessional is never far from a hermeneutics This confessional srrucrure is d isranr from the ancient project that relates truth nor to what one tells bur to what one learns As Foucault puts it in the 1982 lectures Now the subjects obl igation to tell the truth about himself   did nor exist at all in Greek Hellenistic or Roman Anriquiry The person who is led to tell the truth through the masters discourse does not have to say the truth about himself He does nor even have to say the truth And since he does not have to say the truth he does not have to speak HSLCF 364 In the confess ional one tells the rrurh in ancienr practice one learns it This learn ing rakes place in four areas dietetics economics erotics and in relation to truth Dietetics is nor only about diet bur concerns the general health regimen A proper health regimen requires moderation and timel iness Foucault suggests rhar there are rwo types o f an enrion paid ro dietetics a serial vigi lance and a circumstanrial one The serial vigilance concerns the order in which activities are performed activities were nor simply good or bad in themselves their value was determined in part by 113 THE PHILOSOPHY Of FOUCAULT those that preceded them and those that followed UP 1 06  C ircumstantial vigi lance requ ires an awareness of the circumstances in which the activity is to rake place  the climate of course the seasons the hours of the day the degree of humidity and dryness of hear or cold the winds the characteristic features of a region the layout of a city ibid One must in engaging in a proper health regimen follow a reasonable order of activities It is imperative nor engage in excessive or deficient exercise sex or eating to be aware of where and when the aphrodisiac pleasures are to rake place and at all times to maintain control over oneself in any engagement If sex has a d istinctive character in ancient dietetics it is because it more than other activities is associated with vio lence expenditure and death The sexual act is a violent one involving a surge of spasmodic activity that threatens a persons selfmastery It also involves expenditure Sex involves the imparting of lifegiving forces they are transferred from oneself to another and thus entail an expenditure of ones own life forces Fina lly there is in Greek thought an association of sex with death as there is in the French language orgasm being le petitmort Just as sex brings life that bringing of life is in recompense for lives that are passing away In regard to the d ietetics of sex Foucault concludes that The sexual act d id not occasion anxiety because it was associated with evil bur because it disturbed and threatened the ind ividual s relation with himself and his integrity as an eth ical subject in the making if it was nor properly measured and distributed ir carried the threat of a breaking forth of involuntary forces a lessen ing of energy and death without honorable descendents UP 136 7 Economics in ancient thought concerns the running of the household For the ancients of course the man is the proper ru ler of the household This idea extends further among the Greeks to a lack of symmetry with Plato an exception here regarding household obi igarions lr is not just rhar there are different duties involved for the husband and wife The nature of obligation is different The woman is obliged ro the husband bur the husband is obliged to himself The project of the wife centres on fidelity whereas for the husband it concerns selfmastery Thus it is that if adultery is a wrong it is nor because a man has betrayed his wife rather it is because a wife has betrayed her husband and because another man has betrayed his civic duty toward that husband In sum then The husband is selfobligated in this respect since the fact of being married commits him to a particular interplay of duties and 114 WHO WE ARE AND WHO WE MIGHT BE demands in which his reputation his relation to others his prestige in the city and his willingness to lead a fine and good existence are at stake ibid 182 3 Erorics is the most vexed of the aphrodisiac activities This has to do in particular with the fact that it concerns love between men and between men and adolescem boys For Christian ity the problemarization of sex is centred on the woman bur for reasons just memioned the problemarization of sex among the ancient Greeks does nor arise there It arises in the sexual relations between males On the one hand these relations are characterized by equality since each of t he partners is an equal citizen of the ciry On the other hand since the ethical requ iremem placed on each is one of an active selfmastery the issue of passiviry becomes more urgent The reason is that sex for the ancient Greeks is in dissociable from penetration Penetration requires an active subject and a passive subject To become penetrated is to become dominated to be mastered instead of master This in itself is a d ishonour but the dishonour extends to questioning ones ability to govern oneself and even more generally to taking ones proper place in the governance of the ciry When one played the role of subordinate parrner in the game of pleasure relations one could not be truly dominam in the game of civic and political acriviry ibid 220 This question becomes even more complex when the issue is one of sexual relations between men and adolescem boys On the one hand boys like women are objects of beaury and can be appreciated and approached as such On the other hand boys are to become men free citizens of the citystate For a boy to allow himself to be dominated by another male is to imperil both his imegriry and his reputation among fellow citizens This seems to pur the boy in a paradoxical situation where neither acceptance nor refusal can operate without leaving an unseem ly remainder We can begin to see here why although the Greeks engage in rather than prohibit sex between men their eth ical problematizarion of this sex does nor provide a contemporary model for Foucault Nor only as he indicates is there no possibi lity of a return to ear lier models of living In addition there is an irresolvable comradiction that lies at the heart of this problemarizarion namely the d ifficulty caused in this sociery that accepted sexual relations between men by the juxtaposition of an ethos of male superiority and a conception of all sexual imercourse in terms of the schema of penetration and male domination ibid  Foucaults treatment of the relation of sex andl truth is more clipped drawing from Plato and particularly from the Symposium He suggests that the question of truth in regard to sexuality is one of true love It arises in the relation between men and boys since women are nor considered equals and 115 THE PHILOSOPHY Of FOUCAULT so are unable to rise to the occasion of true love For Plato however the question of true love is transformed in Socrates lunds into the question of the nature of love It becomes a re flection on Eros This leads Socrates to endorse a love that is removed from physical relat ions between people and turns toward a love of higher things This ntrn presages the later Christian privileging of renunciation al though it does so not as much th rough what it rejects as through what it seeks The third volume of the history of sexuality extends the themes of the second volume into the first two centuries of our era We will not follow this extension in derail here In the 1982 lectures Foucault offers a more detai led discussion of the care of the self in general The third volume on sexual ity focuses on the care of the self as it bears on sex particularly in regard to health marriage and the relation to boys Foucault summarizes the changes from the Greek approach to these matters A mistrust of the pleasures an emphasis on the consequences of their abuse for the body and the soul a valorization of marriage and marital obligations a disaffection with regard to the spiritual meanings imputed to the love of boys a whole attitude of severity was man ifested in the thinking of philosophers and physicians in the course of the first two centuries CS 39 These changes may sound Christian and indeed early Christian ity draws from them However they appear in a Hellenistic context that inflects their meaning toward a form of selfcultivation rather than selfdenial Foucault notes rhatthese changes stem in good part from a d ifferent view of marriage and marital obl igations on the one hand and a different political situation Imperial Rome as opposed to the Greek citystate on the other The transformation of the view of marriage is one in which the wife becomes a more relevant factor therefore beginning to shift the basis of love from that between males to that between a male and a female Regarding politics there are a number of modifications including the complex bureaucratic institutions for governance that Rome develops T hese replace the more personal democratic institutions of the Greek citystare and require changes nor only in the public sphere but also in the economic sphere and the interpersonal one Foucaults last two volumes on the history of sexuality are published just before his death T hey have been welcomed by many scholars of ancient though t if for no other reason than they confer on ancient studies the cachet associated with Foucaults name Because Foucault is nor as he openly admits a scholar of ancient thought one might ask after the 116 WHO WE ARE AND WHO WE MIGHT BE accuracy of his inrerprerarions of Greek and Hellenistic texts and the contexts in which they are written Perhaps the most renchanr criticism of his read ing emerges from the French scholar Pierre Hador whom Foucault rakes as a model for his own orientation toward rh e ancienr texts One of Haders most imporranr contributions to the study of ancienr ph ilosophy lies in his idea that ancient ph ilosophy is cenrred on the question of how one should live Ancienr ph ilosophy is nor as anachron istic interpretations wou ld have it a project of inrerprering the world It is a matter of figuring our how one should conduct ones life Therefore ph ilosophers are not limi ted to those who have particular doctrines they defend A philosopher in the ancienr world is anyone who conducts his life according to a proper doctrine of how one should live To approach ancienr though t this way opens it not only to a d ifferent inrerprerarion bur also to a differenr ph ilosophica l sensibility One no longer asks whether the doctrine is correct in the sense of having explanatory power lnstead one asks whether it provides a compelling picture of how a life should be conducted The affinities Foucault finds with Haders approach are obvious Not only is Foucaults general method of focusing on knowledge as it arises with practices convergent with Hadots work his speclific treatment of ancienr ph ilosophy ph ilosophy before the Cartesian momenr as a matter of the care of the self is in line with Haders Indeed Foucault credits Hadors work as an influence on his own reading of the ancienrs3 In turn Hadot has written an article Reflections on the Idea of the  Cultivation of the Self that offers his assessmenr of Foucaul ts approach4 Hador o f course is in sympathy with Foucaults emphasis on the care of the self and on his approach to ancienr texts rhrough practices rather than through abstract reflection However in Haders eyes Foucault misses a crucial element of ancienr thought one that renders Foucaults interpretation anachron istic in its own way For the ancients the care of the self is not directed solely toward ones selfdevelopment There is a larger cosmic conrexr within which one cares for oneself and the goal of such care is to be in accord with that larger conrext The universe has a structure and for many ancienr thinkers a relos a goal To live properly is to live in accordance wi th that structure or to contribute in the right way to that telos For instance the Stoics think that the unfolding of the cosmos is a display of reason the universe although always in flux accords with a rational principle We might say that the universe expresses Reason with all the COI1110tat ions the capital letter brings with it In being caught up in the everyday concerns of ones life one neglects or is blind to that Reason and therefore does nor live in the proper relation to it T he poinr of caring for oneself for the ancienrs is to be able to atmne oneself to the larger conrext in which one lives 117 THE PHILOSOPHY Of FOUCAULT To pur the point another way it is nor freedom as Foucault would have it bur objectively proper living that is the relos of ancient practices of the self Hadar says One seeks to be ones own master to possess oneself and find ones happiness in freedom and inner inde pendence I concur on all these points I do think however that thi s movement of interiorization is inseparably linked to another movement whereby one rises to a higher psychic level    wh ich consists in becoming aware of oneself as a parr of nature and a portion of universal reason Foucault as a product of twentiethcentury thinking fai ls to recogn ize the larger cosmic framework assumed by the ancients In the wake of Nietzsche and others who pronounce and work within the context of the death of God Foucault forgers that for the ancients the existence of such a framework is inseparable from their thought If Hadar has the proper interpretation here and Foucault admits that he is no scholar of ancient thought what difference would this make for our relation to the last two volumes of the history of sexuality It wou ld introduce a greater distance between our lives and those of the ancients To the degree that we do nor see the universe governed by the type of Reason or natural hierarchy or cosmic order characteristic of the ancients we are less likely to make ancient living a model for our own Is this a problem for Foucault In one way no and in another way yes Foucault is clear as we have seen that he does nor rake the ancients as a model for contemporary living He describes their lives in such a way as to loosen the grip ours have on us His project is motivated as he puts it by the only kind of curiosity in any case that is worth acting upon with a degree of obstinacy   that which enables one to get free o f oneself  It is not because we should follow the ancients that he seeks to understand their lives bur because they allow him to see the contingency of our own selfunderstanding In this sense his fa ilure to recognize the larger universal context they assume in their living is nothing more than an interpretative mistake that needs correction There is a sense however in which the error Hada r ascribes to Foucault does cause his project a difficulty or at least introduces a cautionary note It is clear that Foucault is attracted by the orientation of the care of the self He finds it an attractive alternative to the current philosophical orientation an orientation driven by concerns that are divorced from the question of how a life might go When he complains that we think of objects bur nor lives as works of art he is suggesting that the care of the self selfcul rivarion may be a way of introducing aesthetic considerations into the conduct of living Indeed he calls the ancient Greek attitude an aesthetics 118 WHO WE ARE AND WHO WE MIGHT BE of ex istence And perhaps the reason he neglects to consider the wider cosmic context in which the ancients think is that he seeks to bring the idea of the care of the self closer to us If the ancients do not provide a model for living at least we can borrow and rework for our purposes an important element of their ph ilosophical approach If Hadots reservations are right then we must be circumspect in that borrowing and reworking We cannot simply remove the orientation and apply it ro our lives because that orientation brings wirh it an assumption or ser of assumptions that we can no longer embrace T his does nor mean rhat we cannot use rhe orientation at all  bur it does mean rhat we musr be carefu l We musr see rhe orientation provided by rhe care of the se lf for what ir is in the ancient world and if we are tO adopt elements of rhe ph ilosophica l orientation it provides we musr recognize rhe opportunities and dangers of rhe transformation we shall be purring it through This vigi lance is nor foreign ro Foucaults thought It is he after all who calls our attention to derails that more general d iscussions often miss In rhis case we musr apply his criterion ro his own work wirh all the caution rhis impl ies Ir remains for us in this chapter ro assess Foucaulirs work on ethics in rhe light of the five characteristics I have suggested lie at the core of his rhough r All five characterist ics are in evidence although at rimes in different ways from the way rhey appear in some of the earlier works First iris clear as is rhe case across the t rajectory of Foucaults work rhar rhe determination of who the ancients are is a collective one Although the evidence for how that determination works is more scant rhan in recent history  ar times Foucaults interpretations are based on the few extant rexrs rhar address a particular problem  he always assumes that these rexrs are reflective of a broader social and historical context lr is not what individuals recommend bur how a people approaches life rhar interests him Thar is why he focuses on problematizarions His rask is to discover in regard to sex the normarive issues the ancient Greeks and then the Romans face and what paths are open ro navigate them If Foucault retains a commitment ro collective d etermination however rhere is a different in flection in his later work We lll ighr ar the risk of oversimplifying say that rhis collective determination is more in flected toward a collective selfdetermination In the archaeological works there is no discussion of how rhe determination of who we are happens This is because of his focus on historical discontinuity In rhe genealogical works there is more of a causal story bur rhar story involves power In rhe ethical writings rhe introduction of concepts like care of rhe self and selfculrivarion seem ro lend a sense of selfcontrol ro peoples construction of who they are that is missing up unti l that po int In facr many critics of Foucaults early writings 119 THE PHILOSOPHY Of FOUCAULT have been sympathetic to the later ones T hey rake Foucault as finally conceding the importance of the role of subjectivity that is missing from both archaeology and genealogy My own view is that it is easy ro overstate the differences between the earl ier and later works on this poim To be snre the idea of the care of the self and the oriemarion toward selfmaking appear more prominemly in the writings on ancienr thought However this is primari ly because in Foucaulrs view the care of the self provides the framework for the ancienrs view of their relation ro their lives If as the genealogical wrirings suggest we ofren see ourselves rhrough rhe lens of psychology the ancients ofren see rhemselves rh rough the lens of selfcare The ancients are no more  and jusr as importanr no less  able ro jerrison rheir co llective determination rhan we are T his is nor to deny that Foucaulr believes rhar there can be fru itful borrowing from rhe anciem framework for rhinking a bour our lives However rhar borrowing will be in the service of living orherwise rhan we do now And rhar project rhe project of living orherwise is never far from Foucaulrs writings W hen he engages in genealogy for instance he does so wirh rhe goal of showing us that since who we are now is rhe product of a conringent history living otherwise is always avai lable ro us Perhaps rhen rhe difference berween the erhics and rhe earlier works is rhat the erh ical works in add ition ro providing alternative views o f how people have lived offer positive elements robe appropriated It is not that Foucault has rediscovered the subjecr The consrirurion of who we a re rhe construction of the subjecr is always for him both co llective and comingent Rather it is rhar rhe oriemarion of his wrirings is less overtly cri tica l than ir is of our more recent history These considerations also address the second characteristic of Foucaults rhoughr rhar who we are is not jusr somerhing we can shake off T his is as rrue of rhe anciems wirh rheir care of rhe self as ir is of us If as we have seen power operates differenrly in the ancient world rhar is nor because rhere is no power bur because the forms ir rakes correspond to the social economic and technological orientation and capaciries of the rime Foucaulr does not argue rhar rhe ancienr Greeks or Romans are freer than we are now Nor does he argue rhar they are less free When Foucault discusses freedom his concern is nor the more and the less T he quesrion of free will and determinism is nor a rouchsrone of his thoughr That we cannot easily shake off the dererminarions of our hisrory is a central commirmenr of his rhoughr Bur rhar rhose dererminarions are comingenr and rherefore can be shaken off is just as cenrral a commirmenr W hether ulrimarely this shaking off is a marrer of free will or anorher form of determinism is a question rhar does nor interesr him 120 WHO WE ARE AND WHO WE MIGHT BE The determinacion of ancienr Greek and Roman lives is as complex in rhe ethical works as iris in rhe earlier studies W ho rhey are is nor rhe result o f a single overarching or underlying rheme Ir is rhe product of a network of inreracring practices and concerns T hose practices and concerns converge on problemarizarions rhat are difficu lt to navigate and sometimes as in rhe case of Greek male sex paradoxical or con tradicrory Moreover rhe last rwo volumes of the history of sexuality are nor discussions of Greek life per se but rather of a single rhread in rhar life the rhread of sex Foucaul t holds rhar thread ro be of great momenr in the fabric of ancienr life Bur he nowhere argues rhat ancienr life can be understood solely by reference to sex or rhat rhe problemarizarions of sex are rhe only problemarizarions in rhe ancienr world To rhe conrrary if we are to believe the lessons of rhe first vo lume rhe arrempr ro make sex rhe pivor of understanding who one is is precisely the project of normalization rhar Foucault seeks to overturn In the archaeological works rhe question of complexity is a vexed one To be sure rhe archives Foucault describes are complex The rules and norms he discovers in them are elusive and difficu lt to isolate from rhe pract ices and rexrs he studies On rhe other hand the question of generality haunts his archaeological writings He seems uncertain abour the exrenr to which rhe themes he unfolds are supposed ro be characteristic of a larger social or cultural context By conrrasr rhe genealogical works are clearly limited in scope Who we are is a product nor of a single ser of themes bur of differenr intersections of d iverse practices that follow a complex and con tingent historical trajectory Discipline is one theme biopower another In rhe genealogical writings Foucault ho lds ro Bergers dictum rhar we can no longer te ll a story as though ir were rhe only one The last rwo volumes of the history of sexual iry although they treat a single theme do nor betray rhe lesson of genealogy They remain faithful to the idea rhar who we are is a product o f a comp lex history that can nor be reduced ro a dominanr theme or movement or process T here is no Archimedean point for understanding rhe ancients any more than there is for understanding ourselves The fourth characteristic of Foucaults rhoughr rhe intimacy of acting and knowing is on full d isplay in rhe ethical works If one is nor careful one mighr be tempted to say that rhe ethical works show a more inrimare bond between action and knowledge than rhe earl ier works This would be a mistake although there is a r ighr idea in ir Foucaults argument is nor rhar rhe ancients have a deeper bond between their rrurhs and their lives bur rather rhar they see themselves as having a deep bond The philosophical rrurhs with which the ancients are concerned contribute ro the care of rhe self Those who practise such a care are drawn to rhe rrurhs rhar wi ll assist them in rhar practice 121 THE PHilOSOPHY O f FOUCAULT Compare this with the psychological truths characteristic of the discipl inary regime On the one hand there is no formal project of selfcare characteristic of the ancients either in psychology or in phi losophy On the other hand and more important one sees who one is and how one should act in terms of the psychological truths that form the epistemic framework of discipline One may not see oneself as constructing a life in the same way as the ancient Greeks bur one is concerned with being normal and conforming to the psychological concerns that preoccupy rhe carceral archipelago The difference here is less than it might seem from a standpoint that sees a stark division between genealogy and ethics It is less than it might seem if we draw too sharp a line between constitution and selfconstitution As Foucault reminds us with the concept of problematizarion beyond the morality of duties and obligations there are always spheres of behaviour that are the object of scrutiny ambivalence and uncertainty It is nor that the ancients face problematizarions and we moderns do nor Rather ir is rhar different problemarizations face each One of rhe important problemarizarions for the ancients concerns sex in irs role in the care of the self for the moderns it concerns ones psychological stare or ones sexual desire in relation to normality The last characteristic of Foucaults though t is t hat of the historical contingency of who we are We have already seen the operation of this contingency in the discussion of our collective determination In that discussion the theme of freedom was broached It is perhaps fining ro end a consideration of Foucaults treatment of the ancients with a d iscussion of the ro le of freedom in his though t There are many who see in Foucault parrico larly in his genealogical works a po litical fatal ism Everything is a maner of power the product of unseen forces insidiously determining who we are There is no reason to struggle and no point in struggl ing anyway since we shall on ly wind up in another nexus of power Among those who see Foucaults earlier works this way there is often a sigh of relief that greers rhe appearance of the ethical works After all here we are faced with a subject that can create itself make something of itsel f rather than being merely a node in an evolving system of power However there is no great divide between the earl ier works and the later ones T he concept of problemarizarion should make that clear Foucault nowhere argues that our lives are completely circumscribed by the arch ives he describes in the archaeological works or the powers he recounts in the genealogical ones Conversely he nowhere clairns that the care of the self is free from the constraints of the practices and norms of the rime Quire the opposite To ask whether Foucault sees us as having free will or as being completely determined by the contexts rules norms and powers he 122 WHO WE ARE AND WHO WE MIGHT BE describes is to ask the wrong question It is to impose the free will debate on a set of texts for which it is irrelevant This is nor to say that the debate itself is nor important or that irs results do nor have an impact on how we see Foucaults works Rather it is to say that Foucaults writings cannot be read through the lens of that debate without distorting them What then are we to make of the idea of freedom How does it apply to Foucaults works if at all  There are two separate questions we might ask here only one of which we shall answer One question concerns the normative status of the term freedom How does Foucault justify his criticism of disciplinary power or his embrace of the care of the self or an aesthetics of living as an exercise in freedom W hat reasons can he give us for valuing the latter and nor the former Is it simply a matter of personal preference and if nor why nor If certain forms of power must be abandoned and others nor how do we mark the difference between the two These are difficu lt questions ones that Foucaults writings do nor address except perhaps ro invoke rhe term intolerable with regard ro particular practices or power arrangements They are questions we cannot address here without raking the discuss ion roo far afield bur are certainly worth the ask ing6 The other question is what does this freedom consist in If it is nor a matter of carving our a space o f free will then what are we to make of the freedom Foucaults works seek to offer us One hint for understanding it relies on returning to Foucaults reference in the peface to the second vol ume on sexuality to curiosity Curiosity in Foucaults sense means stray ing afield of oneself Freedom for Foucault lies in this straying afield of who one is Bur what is this straying Our history yields a particular complex of practices with their ru les norms problemarizations knowledges and power arrangements Each of us participates in some of those practices By participating in them we subject ourselves to some of those ru les norms problemarizarions knowledges and power arrangements That is how we become who we are Our practices are laden with a pol itically ethically and episremically charged history that infuses us through the practices we engage in What Foucault describes with different inflections in all his works are important moments and elements of that history It is a history that is at once constitutive and contingent it makes us who we are bur nor by necessity If we understand our history understand who we have come to be and understand that we do nor have to be that then we are faced wirl the possibil ity of being something else That is our freedom  We must be clear here To say that we can be something else is nor ro say that we can be anything else We cannot simply choose who we are to be The recogn ition of how we have come to be who we are does nor eliminate the history that has brought us here It does nor eliminate the context in 123 THE PHilOSOPHY O f FOUCAULT which we choose nor the constra ints that contex t imposes Moreover the complexity of our historical legacy allows us to question some areas of our lives but not all of them at the same rime We may question aspects of who we have come to be bur we cannot step outside ourselves leap from our own historical skin to choose our lives from some vanrage point beyond the vagaries of our history and context To stray afield of oneself is not to recreate oneself our of whole cloth Rather it is to experiment wi th who one might be to t ry other ways of being that may turn our to be more tolerable than who we are now In Foucaults wri tings and in his life the theme of experimentation as an alternative to being who we are now is salient To stray afield of ourselves is precisely to experiment with who we might be What characterizes experimentation is its probing and tentative character W hen we experiment with who we might be we do so in the knowledge either that we might fai l or alternatively that we might succeed only to find that our success has created another form of intolerability After all the intersection of practices that has brought us to this point was not intended to del iver us here Discipline and biopower are not the products of design bur of a history that could very well have been otherwise In the interview where Foucault den ies that he sees the Greeks as providing a model for contemporary living he tells us My point is not that everything is bad bur that everything is dangerous wh ich is not exactly the same as bad If everything is dangerous then we always have something to do So my position leads not to apathy but to a hyper and pessimistic activism OGE 343 If everyth ing is dangerous if everything is capabe of yielding the intolerable then we must be vigilant not only abou t who we have come to be but also about who we seek to make ourselves to be We must look as we create raking account not only of what we intend bur of what actually happens YJe must bear in mind Foucaults dictum that people often know what they do and why they do it bur not what their doing it does T his is what it means to treat a life as an experiment To be free is to be able to experiment with who we are It is to be able to make ourselves into something other than what we have come to be to play with overturn undercut rearrange parody go beyond the legacy that we are And to do so is mostly if not always or completely a collective project Freedom occurs as a we nor as an I It should be clear to us why this is If our determination is collective if who we are is a product of a history we share with others then any form of experimentat ion is likely to rake place alongside others as wel l It is difficult although perhaps not impossible to 124 WHO WE ARE AND WHO WE MIGHT BE imagine that a single person can succeed in strayng afield of themselves when the rest of the social field in which they are immersed remains unchanged Even to engage in so litary activities  writing or painting for instance  is to respond to current social norms and expectations if perhaps through rejecting them And it is to imagine others who are willing to engage with ones own efforts either through reading or viewing or writing or painting in turn To experiment requires that there are others who are willing to experi ment that there is a we wi lling to jettison the intolerable for something that is perhaps better The freedom to become who we might be is like the history that brought us here at once co llective and contingent As there is neither necessity nor individuality to our historica l inheritance so there is neither to our freedom  We face our possibi lities as a darkly lit path together with those who are willing to travel it with us 125 CHAPTER FIVE Coda Foucau lts own straying afield Do not ask me who I am and do not ask me to remain the same leave it to our bureaucrats and our police to see that our papers are in order How is one ro say something about Foucaults life in the wake of this request Can one say anything at all without betraying him Or are we to dwell within the irony that this thinker who told us so much about who we are now and opened doors to our asking who we might be is someone about whom we are barred from asking who he was We cannot do biography T his much is clear We cannot say Foucault is this he is nor that Or bener if we want to say who Foucault is we need look no further than his writings T here he seeks ro tell us who we are who we are now and he among us History nor psychology is what is required to know who we are and to know the conti ngency of that who so we can make ourselves into something else so that we can rake care of ourselves mould ourselves into a work of art We cannot place Foucault nearly in a set of psychological categories and think we have remained within the ambit of h is own though t And yet in the wake of this last chapter in the personal seeking his thought displays there perhaps there is a way to say something about him that would reveal a bit about his own selfcreation without placing him within an episremic framework that his works constitute a constant srruggle to abandon T his much alone for standard biography Foucault was born in 1926 and died in 1984 From here let us ask instead wh o he made himself ro be We may ask this in many ways bur we shall let three suffice here Foucault made himself a writer a political activist a sexual experimenter There is more we could say and some biographers have attempted it 1 Our interest here is nor in canvassing a life bur in seeing in Foucaults life an answer to the question of who one might be how one might st ray afield of oneself given who one has been made to be 126 CODA FOUCAULT S OWN STRAYING AFIELD First a writer This is the most obvious aspect of who Foucault makes himself to be and for that reason the one whose implications we are most likely to miss When Foucault tells us late in his life that he writes to stray afield of himself this is in keeping with the quotation from fifteen years earlier that opens this chapters coda We know the aim of his wri ting to tell us who we are now in irs contingency and this in order to open the question of who we might be Bur what might this have to do with Foucault himself the writer Is he lost to his writings Are they projects whose motivation lies solely wi th their intended effect on his audience Hardly This is nor how it is when one writes or at least when one writes anyth ing worthwhi le To write about who we are who we have come to be is nor only to recount a history it is to undergo it to feel irs movement as well as irs contingency viscerally Vhen Foucault says he writes to become something other than what he is this is nor on ly as a result of the writing It is nor something that only comes afterwards when the work is completed when iris whole when the words have been said To think otherwise is to see a writer above his writing rather than within it Foucault makes clear however that his writing is always an experiment a way of making himself into something It is a way of making himself into something other than he is In his writing Foucaults present both emerges in irs fullness and loses irs grip upon him That is where the power of the writing lies It is nor just a fantasy It is nor just that Foucault frees himself in his head by writing He does nor merely rake a journey if a true journey on a personal intellectual itinerary If our present has us in irs grasp if it can make us believe that who we are is who we must be this is nor solely by convincing us with arguments It is nor solely cognitive it is affective as wel l Maybe even more so To see the present in irs contingency then is not just to recognize it by argument or by history It is to feel it And that is where the writing assumes its significance For Foucault wri ting is nor on ly a matter of telling us histories we should know It is nor only tell ing himself such histories It is for him to undergo those histories affectively It is to navigate the currents that have brought us here and to see firsthand not on ly with his mind bur with the rest of his body the openings that appear among those currents Vriting is a matter not on ly of telling himself what he needs to know in order to take care of himself It is itself a way of taking care of himself of making himself by means of straying afield of himself For some writers this is enough Foucaults co lleague Deleuze responds to a cri tic who mocks him for writing about journeys he does not take If I stick where I am if I dont travel around li ke anyone else I make my inner journeys that I can only measure by my emotions and express very 127 THE PHILOSOPHY Of FOUCAULT obliquely in what I write 2 This is nor Foucaults way To write is indeed to make oneself into something else There are other ways as well and Foucault chooses some of them For instance politics There is a long history of the involvement of French intellectuals in public political discourse This will strike many in the United States in particular as strange Public debate in the Uni ted Stares seems bereft of intellecruals On the one hand most of them have abandoned the field especially philosophers who have created a discourse that often seems to immunize itse lf against public understanding On the other hand those who place themselves  or are placed  at the centre of public debate seem themselves immune ro intellecrual rigou r Nor so in France where ar least since Sarrre the role of the public inrellecrual in modern history is taken for granted In Foucaults case ir is nor surprising that the events of May 68 push Foucaul t as he arremprs ro grasp the operation of power into the role of raking public stances and engaging in debate about  current 1ssues Among those issues there are four that may be worrh noting First he becomes involved in 1971 in the formation of the movement Groupe dInormation SliT les Prisons GIP  This group works alongside prisoners in order to call attention to prison conditions to unjust punishment and to the political namre of the penal system Undoubtedly it in forms Foucaults own thinking His nex t book published four years later is Discipline and Punish However although Foucault is a leader in this movement he does nor act as its spokesperson T his wou ld be a violation of his thought One does nor tell prisoners what they should think one allows them ro speak for themselves One works alongside prisoners nor in their name The publications of the GIP use information gleaned from firsthand conracr with prisoners and also create space for prisoners themselves to write about their own experiences and offer their own analysis of rhe prison system In 1979 Foucault briefly becomes involved in the plight of the Vietnamese boar people Recall that in the late 1970s many Vietnamese fled the communist dictatorship of Vietnam by boar often raking dangerous journeys in flimsy ships and often refused entry by countries such as the United Stares and France wh ich contributed so much ro rhar country s destruction  In 198 1 Foucault participates in a press conference where he reads a document that nor only signals his solidarity with the boar people bur eloquently stares rhe bonds rhar might exist among all those who are subjeer ro power He says There exists an international citizenry that has its righ ts that has its duties and that is commirred ro rise up against every abuse of power no marrer who the author no marrer who the victims After 128 CODA FOUCAULT S OWN STRAYING AFIELD all we are all ruled and as such we are in sol idariry   The wil l of individuals must be inscribed in a reality that the governments wanted to monopolize This monopoly must be wrested from them bit by bit each and every day 3 Foucault is in sympathy with those who stand against aurhoriry In one case this leads him astray During the Iran ian revollurion of 1979 Foucault visits Iran several times as a journalist and becomes taken with the movement against the Shah He speculates that an Islamic movement against the government might offer new models for living and for selfgovern ing models that reject both liberal democracy and the roraUrarianism of many postcolonial regimes This optimism is mistaken and Foucault soon distances himself from it Among many whose view of Islamic movements is more measured Foucaults sympathy for the Islamic resistance is thought to be naive and he is excoriated in the French press for it For a while he withdraws from public comment on current affairs Nor permanently though Virh the rise of Solidarity in Poland Foucault again lends his name and his time to a resistance movement against ru lers In this he goes against the established left In 198 1 the Social ist Franois Minerrand becomes Frances President ushering in hopes for a renewal of the left in France The government however never fulfils these hopes Early on it offers a signal of irs movement toward the centre by refusing to stand with the Solidariry movement against the Po lish communist regime Foucault refuses to support the governments stand and alongside other prominent intellectuals openly supports Solidariry There is a common theme among these four po litical involvements They are all in support of movements against established authority In two cases Vietnam and Poland Foucault opposes the rule of communists in the case of Iran he opposes those who support the Shah in the name of anticommunism With the GIP he works alongside prisoners against those who rule them and more important who silence them There is a reason for this one that is in keeping with Foucaults genealogical orientation In an interview in 1977 Foucault distinguishes what he calls universal and specific intellectuals Universal imellectuals speak in the name of humaniry For a long period the left intellectual spoke and was acknowledged the right of speaking in the capacity of master of t ruth and justice He was heard or purported to make himself heard as the spokesman of the un iversal To be an intellecrual meam something like being the consciousnessconscience of us a ll  TP 126 129 THE PHILOSOPHY Of FOUCAULT The specific imellecrual by conrrasr does nor represem humanity He does nor represem anybody Instead he works alongside those who struggle providing imellecrual rools in specific areas that can be appropriated by rhose who are capable of resisting rhe imolerable in their own name If rhe universal imellecrual courts rhe danger of speaking in rhe name of others rhe specific imellecrual courts the symmetrical danger of fa iling to see rhe larger picrure wirhin which he operates The task Foucault argues is ro remain a specific imellecmal without losing sighr of the general politics of truth within which those struggles rake place One can see Discipline and Punish and rhe first volume of rhe history of sexual ity in this lighr They follow specific threads of our history of rhe consrirurion of who we are now Ar rhe same rime they have larger and more general implications They caprure imporram ways in which rhe politics of truth  powerknowledge  has infi ltrated our society Foucaults pol itical involvemems reflect rhe same approach and attirude On the one hand he works a longside and in solidarity wirh SIPecific struggles He does so nor in rhe name of humanity bur in the name of rhose struggles themselves On rhe orher hand there is a larger issue ar srake one thar informs all his involvements We are all ruled and as such we are all in solidarity Against those who would rellus who we are and where we should stand whether rhey be from rhe established right or rhe established left  Foucault stakes our a position rhar resists the rrurhs rhar we are told are the only truths on offer In rhe interv iew where he speaks of universal and specific imellecruals Foucault says The essential political problem for rhe inrellecrual is nor ro criticise rhe ideo logical contents supposedly linked to science or to ensure rhar his own scientific practice is accompanied by a correct ideology Foucault is referring here to Louis Althusser and contemporary Marxist imellecruals but rhar of ascertaining the possibility of const ituting a new politics of rrurh TP 133 We can see this possibi lity ar work in Foucaults public pol itical stances lr is nor in rhe name of or against an establ ished ideology rhar he speaks He aims instead towards rhe possibility of seeing who we are and where we are differently from how we have been raughr This is whar makes him so maddening politically for those who rake comfort in received political caregones Finally sexual experimenration Much has been made of the lasr years of Foucaults life in rhis regard He speaks of his own homosexuality and more notoriously in rhe eyes of some he engages in rhe practice 130 CODA FOUCAULT S OWN STRAYING AFIELD of sadomasochism James Mi ller has written a breathless biography of Foucault that derai ls his sexual experimentation and his encounters in the bathhouses of 1980s San Francisco He ascribes it to Foucaults search for limitexperiences and fascination with death4 Foucaults death of AIDS seems to some to confirm this read ing of his sexual life I suspect the truth is both more pedestrian and more in keeping with Foucaults intellectual orientation Near the end of the first volume of his history of sexual ity Foucault tells us that The rallying point for the counterattack against the deployment of sexuality ought not to be sexdesire bur bodies and pleasures HS 157 Why nor see his sexual experimentation in that light Foucault himself offers this interpretation of his sadomasochist activities The practice of S M is the creation of pleasure   and that s why SM is really a subculture Its a process of invention S M is the use of a strategic relationship as a course of pleasure physical pleasure To create ourselves is in Foucaults view an experin1ent It involves straying afield of onese lf in order to see where that may lead Foucaults sexual experimentation should be seen as exactly that If it is titillating to some this is nor because Foucault has chosen to titillate bur because his experimentation has crossed the boundaries of rheir own experience In writing politics and sex Foucault seeks He experiments His life like his works is restless There are those who srray afield by immersing themselves in a single activity seeing what it offers where it leads them bur always further down a single road Foucaults selfcreation is different He is in constant renewa l He does nor allow himself ro become comfortable on a particular piece of terrain before he moves on Do not ask me to remain the same There are many ways to experiment many ways to create or to rake care of oneself many ways towards a new politics of truth In his own life Foucault explores a number of them bur leaves behind enough markers for us to go further along our own chosen paths 131 CHAPTER SIX Are we still who Foucault says we are As I wri te this it is rwenryone years since Foucaults death His last published book that does not deal with ancient practices is twentynine years old Since his death we have seen the rise of the internet DVDs cell phones gated communities Tivo sport uti lity vehicles email and instant messaging The United States has started three wars two in Iraq and one in Afghanistan Terrorism not communism is the chosen enemy of what would charitably be called Vesrern democracies Neoliberalism has come to replace welfare liberal ism in many quarters as the reigning economic phi losophy of the stare Europe has made steps toward integration the Soviet Union has disintegrated China seeks to position itself as the next great national power as the Uni ted Stares squanders irs resources irs mi litary and irs good wil l In short much has changed To admit that much has changed requires us to ask of Foucault a question that is an ineluctably Foucauldian one Are we st ill who Foucault has said that we are Do we remain the norma lized beings of discipl ine the empiricorranscendental doubler the man of The Order of Things the products of biopower the moral legacy of a Reason that seeks to keep its madness at bay Are the accounts Foucault offers us still accounts of the character of our being Or have we moved on Are we in another episteme another archive another genealogical moment from the one Foucault has brought us to Foucault writes that his work is a contributon to a history of the presenr DP 31 Is that present the same one we now inhabi t Or are we in another presenr one that requires another thinker and another history To be sure Foucault sees himself in N ietzsches term as an untimely thinker Bur to be untime ly is to think aga inst the grain of ones rime to offer a thought outside or beyond the rime in which one lives To be untimely is nor the same as being anachron istic Are Foucaults works still untimely or are they merely behind the rimes 132 ARE WE STILl WHO FOUCAUlT SAYS WE ARE Are we now different There are many who believe we have moved on that Foucaults works describe the emergence of the period before the one we are living in Foucault never uses the term postmodem which for some srands as an indicator of a new historical condition JeanFranois Lyorard would be among those who embrace the term and the novelty it implies For others who either do nor use the term such as Jean Baudril lard or who reject it as empty or misleading like Gilles Deleuze there is still reason ro think that our history has taken another turn that we need new concepts and new analyses if we are ro understand who and where we are now as well as what we might become Some may respond by saying rhar twenty or thirty years is nor a long rime Historical change is more often gradual than nor particu larly when what is at stake is nor revolutionary upheaval bur more often the quotidian practices rhar make us who we are Bur we need look no further than Foucaults own works ro see that this is nor true In The Birth of the Clinic a work we have nor discussed here Foucault traces the change in medical views o f disease and rhus of the relation of life and death from a model of disease as essence ro one of disease as lesion T his change rakes place from the end of the eighteenth century ro the beginning of the nineteenth in a period of little more than rwo dozen years BC chs 9  10 We cannot avoid a confrontation with the question of Foucaults relation to the present There is no phi losophical fiat by w hich we can spare him scru tin y any more than there is a ph ilosophical manoeuvre that would allow him to be dismissed wi thout being read although there are some who would wish the latter Even if we cannot and we will nor close the debate on this question we must surely open it After all the stakes concern who we are now Are we now still who Foucault says we are Ve can refer ro the three thinkers cited a moment ago in order ro engage this question Deleuze has written a small bur influential piece arguing rhar we have gone beyond the historical juncture Foucault designates as the discipl inary society Baudrillard argues that Foucaults concept of power no longer applies to a world that is more virtua l than real Lyorard does nor simare his famous work The Postmodern Condition in relation ro Foucaults writings bur we can draw from it and related works the conclusion that we have entered a new historical period one characterized by a new type of capitalism Between the three works we can simare the three most important characteristics that many have invoked at rimes with the term postmodern ro argue rhar we have entered a new historical situation fluid networks of control the rise of the electronic media the emergence of transnational capitalism and rampant consumerism These characteristics 133 THE PHilOSOPHY O f FOUCAULT are we shall see related Each thinker though p laces the accent on a different aspect of that relation Deleuzes Postscript on Contro l Societies is only a few pages long It is however one of the most often d iscussed of Deleuzes wri tings No doubt this is in part because it is one of the most accessible Bur it is also one of his most engaged attempts to offer an account o f the world we inhabit It does nor as do many of his other works refer to the present either in passing or indirectly It directly asks the question of where we are How are we situated historically logically and programmatically Written in 1990 it is prescient in irs reference to the unfolding character of our rime Deleuze begins the text by situating himself in re lation to Foucault Foucault associated disciplinary societies with he eighteenth and nineteenth centuries they reach their apogee at the beginning of the twentieth century  But Foucault also knew how shortlived this model was The latter remark is not mere ly a gestu re of generosity Near the end of Discipline and Punish as Foucault is describing the tenacious abil ity of the prison to survive its ongoing failures he notes the suffusion of processes of normalization across society and remarks that  In the midst of all these mechan isms of normalization wh ich are becoming ever more rigorous in their appl ication the specificity of the prison and irs role as link are losing something of their purpose DP 306 As a prediction of the future of the prison in the United States at least this is premature However the thrust of the remark is aimed not so much at the prison itself as at the idea that normalization may nor in the future requ ire disciplinary enclosure This is the idea that an imates Deleuzes  Postscript  Yiere in the midst of a general breakdown of all sires of confinement  prisons hosp itals factories schools the family2 The confined areas in which d iscipline is instilled are no longer operative We are no longer subject to the particular training that discipline invo lves because the closed and enclosing sires in which that training has happened have lost their integrity This is not to say and Deleuze does nor claim that these sires have become entirely irrelevant Rather it is that they are no longer central to the historical dynamic that is unfo ld ing T he d isciplinary society is giving way to what Deleuze calls control societies The reason for this has to do with what Deleuze calls the logic of control societies He cites several differences between the logic of discipline and that of control First the temporal movement of discipline is circular and in control it is endlessly forward In d iscipl inary societies you were always starring all over again as you went from school to barracks from barracks to factory while in control societies you never finish anything 3 Disciplinary societies move individuals from enclosure to enclosure At each enclosure one is moulded accord ing to the ways Foucault describes in Discipline 134 ARE WE STILl WHO FOUCAUlT SAYS WE ARE and Punish In control societies by contrast chis serial mou lding does not exist One is instead always moving to the next thing and the one after chat whether it be as in Deleuzes example continuing education wi th continuous assessment or the next fashion the next ph ilosophy of management the next relationship Discrete spaces do not matter in ch is continuous movement they can happen in any space or with electronic communication in no particular space at all Similarly disciplinary societies work within particular parameters and contro l societies work with modulating fluxes Money perhaps best expresses the difference between the two kinds of societies since discipl ine was always related co molded currencies containing gold as a numerical standard whereas control is based on floating exchange races modulations depend ing on a code setting sample percentages for various currencies Just as discipline occurs within a circular time associated with discrete spaces and control works with an endless time tlat is not pegged to any particular space discipline appl ies norms and values both to individuals discipl ine and groups biopower and control floats among and between individuals and groups subscimcing codes for norms To understand the difference between codes and norms we might use the analogy of quantum physics and Newtonian physics For Newtonian physics the universe consists in discrete elements in particular lawful relations The laws are li ke the norms of a disciplinary society Quantum mechanics on the ocher hand works with probabilities rather chan laws Ic is not chat there are no regularities and chat everyth ing is chaos Rather there are probabilistic regularities chat are associated with the movement of the whole rather chan of any particular element within chat whole Codes are like chose probabilistic regularities As an example one might chink here of the movement of fashion No longer are the styles produced by designers the standard by which ochers create clothing Now clothing and shoe companies send employees into urban areas to discover what the dominant youths usually males in chose areas are interested in In add ition there is a range of niche produces chat seek to appeal co increasingly narrow market demograph ics The fashion industry does not impose a sec of sartorial norms it modulates a code chat arises from an array of sh ifting interests Finally the logic of capitalism has changed Ic is no longer concerned with production chat can be farmed out to less developed countries Rather it focuses on what Deleuze calls metaproduction the oversigh t coordination and marketing of production Markets are won by caking 135 THE PHilOSOPHY O f FOUCAULT comrol rather than by establish ing discipline by fixing rates rather than by reducing costs by transforming products rather than by specializing production 5 Discip line is associated wi th factory product ion and factories in rurn with the esrablishmem and maimenance of norms Comrol societies do nor need a particular space because nothing is made and no norms are imposed One might say that the lmerner or perhaps the laptop com purer is ro comrol societies what factories are ro d isciplinary ones Movemem without end or enclosure modulating codes and metaproduction these are the aspects of comro l societies the societies rhar have replaced disciplinary ones Far from being chaotic these societies are indeed regu lated not by imposing regimes of order in specific spaces bur by imervening in the fluid and probabilistic unfold ing of the activities rhar constitute them Deleuze does not argue that there is nothing left of discipline but he sees a new historical political and economic arrangemem unfolding that is one step beyond the arrangement Foucault describes One might ask of Deleuze whether comrol really is very different from normalization or whether it is instead a modification Certainly as Foucault admits there seems to be less urgency for enclosed spaces According to Foucault the reason for this is that normal izarion has so deeply infi ltrated our society that one does not have to construct discrete spaces in order to insti ll it Is this very different from what De leuze calls control Although the idea of diffuse oversight is characteristic of both nonenclosed normalization and comrol there are st ill important d ifferences Deleuze is describing a dynamic d istinct from tha t of Foucaults discipline Normalization involves the training of individuals according to particular standards ir requ ires personal imervemion and oversight This is one reason why earl ier societies could not have a project of normalization normalization requires a certain leve l of social interaction and technological communication processes associated with the rise of capital ism Vhar Deleuze sees however no longer requires an ind ividual ized inculcation of particular norms Rather it is a more amorp hous matter involving codes and probabilities To be sure there are certa in nor ms in the broad sense of the term There are sartorial fashions ways of acting and tal king things people find valuable and so on However norms are products nor of individualizing projects of normalization They are codes that arise across societies that individuals pick up more or less as they go along Later we shall return to the question of whether in fact COiltrol has rep laced normalization as well as the d iscipline that produces it  For the momem it is enough to recognize rhar they are d istinct processes Recently Deleuzes friend Antonio Negri along with vlichael Hardt has written a book Empire that extends Deleuzes discussion on control societies6 They argue that the world is moving away from the structure of 136 ARE WE STILl WHO FOUCAUlT SAYS WE ARE nationstates characteristic of the previous few centuries at least in much of the world and towards a more fluid structure comprising nationstates transnationa l corporations and nongovernmental organizations Although the United States might be dominant among nationstates it cannot dominate the world in the way say that Britain did during the heyday of imperialism What Hardt and Negri call empire is distinct from imperialism precisely in that the laner is structured by discrete nationstates pursuing their interests through subjugation and exploitation whereas empire is structured by fluid and intersecting political and economic networks with no particular centre and only relatively demarcated geographic boundaries Empire they argue has three imperatives the inclusion of all an affirmat ion of differences and a management and hierarchization of those differences In this sense what is often called posnnodemism and the rising force of fundamentalism are coordinate ideologies one embraces the new sintarion uncritically the other rejects it by seeking ro move backwards Like Deleuze Hardt and Negri do not claim that there are no winners and losers in this new situation or that contro l does nor exist  Rather they claim that winners are not to be seen as a particular class of people who can manipulate the system from above  everyone is included and that they are not to be associated solely with a particular class or nation They are those who monitor exert a measure of control over and benefit from the operation of  emp1re Deleuze Hardt and Negri focus on the structure of the new historical situation they believe we inhabit Baudrillard by contrast focuses on the content and in particular on the technological content of our current historical juncture Baudrillards early writings invert the tvlarxist concern with production arguing that a radical analysis of society ought instead to focus on consumption In his view our identities as producers have been surpassed by our identities as consumers if we are to understand ourselves it is the latter that should receive the analyt ical weight More recently his work has been associated with hyperreality the replacement of concrete lived realiry by a virtual electronic reality that is now the true aether of our lives Hyperrealiry if not by name is already on d isplay in a work Baudrillard publishes in 1977 a year after Foucaults first volume on the history of sexuality Entitled  Forger Foucault it is an argument that the operation of power Foucault describes is already outmoded Foucaults genealogical works depict a world that no longer exists Something tells us   that if it is possible at last to talk with such definitive understanding abom power sexuality the body and discipl ine even down to their most delicate metamorphoses it is because at some point all this is here and now over with7 137 THE PHilOSOPHY OF FOUCAULT Forget Foucault levels a number of charges against Foucaults work including the already refuted idea that Foucault reduces everyth ing to power and therefore subverts his own position Baudrillards most interesting thought however is that Foucaults stress on the role of power is part of a productivist model of society of the kind that Baudrillard criticizes in Marx We need to rep lace the concept of power with that of seduction if we are to understand what is going on in our society In what sense is the idea of power productive We have already seen it One of Foucaults most striking challenges to the trad itional conception of power is that in his view much of the power tow hich we are subject works not by repression bur by creation Rather than preventing us from being who we are or from realizing our true nature power operates by making us who we are YJe are produced by power In this sense Foucaults work is in Baudrillards eyes continuous wi th Marxs They operate on different terrains bur they both embrace a view of reality that emphasizes the production of that real ity Baudrillard argues that this conception of power is sti ll turned toward a reality principle and a very strong truth principle it is still oriented toward a possible coherence of politics and discourse power no longer pertains to the despotic order of what is forbidden and of the law bur it still be longs ro the objective order of the real Here is where we can see the emergence of the idea of hyperreal iry At first glance it might seem incongruous to accuse Foucault of too strong an attachment to a reality principle and particularly to a very strong truth principle Is it not Foucault after all who introduces the concept of power knowledge a concept that seems to weaken rather than strengthen our attachment to what we consider our truths For Baudrillard however Foucault has not yet jettisoned the most important attachment the attachment to a real ity to be analysed Consider Foucaults dictum on the soul in Discipline and Punish It wou ld be wrong to say that the soul is an i llusion or an ideo logical effect On the contrary it exists it has a reality it is produced permanently around on within the body by the functioning of a power that is exercised on those punished DP 29 This is the reality pr incip le Baudrillard refers to Power produces a real ity that genealogy in turn can describe or account for It can tell truths about it because there is something our there something produced for truths genealogical truths  to be true of 138 ARE WE STILl WHO FOUCAUlT SAYS WE ARE In Baudrillard s eyes a realiry produced or not that can be theoretically accounted for is precisely what we no longer have Ve live in a world governed not by a reality but by a virtuality that has no realiry In the terms used by Baudrillard in Forget Foucault we are not produced we are seduced To begin to grasp this idea we can turn to a later text of Baudrillards Simulations T here he offers a chronological summary of three orders of appearance that have governed our relation to reality since the Renaissance  Counterfeit is the dominant scheme of the classical period from the Renaissance to the industrial revolution  Production is the dominant scheme of the industrial era  Simulation is the reigning scheme of the current phase that is controlled by the code9 W hat is the d ifference between simulation and production If product ion works by creating realiry simulation works by feigning one There is no real world in which our lives take place or better the real world is no longer of any account The world in which our lives take place is a simulated world one given to us by images that either no longer reflect the real world or no longer need to We are plugged into images via our media especially television and the internet that simulate a realiry T hat simulated reality is now our own There is no longer a real ity principle because the concrete reality described by those like Foucault s till in thrall to thinking in terms of production has been rep laced by a s imulated reality that is neither produced nor preexisting There is nothing or need be nothing beyond the image In an arresting encapsulation of his view Baudrillard tells us that Disneyland is presented as imaginary in order to make us bel ieve that the rest is real when in fact all of Los Angeles and the America surrounding it are no longer real but of the order of the hyper real and of simulat ion 10 Seduction is a matter of simulation and the hyperreal rather than of production and the rea l To seduce is to die as reality and reconstitute oneself as illusion 11 Seduction works not by creation bur by lure Seduction is that wh ich is everywhere and always opposed to production seduction withdraws something from the visible order and so runs counter to production whose project is to set 139 THE PHILOSOPHY OF FOUCAULT everythi ng up in a clear view whether it be an object a number or a concept 12 Consider the activity of seduction in the everyday sense of the term To seduce someone is not to dominate them to subject them to ones wi ll Seduction does not make an appearance on the scene as something visible It works more by what is suggested but not there rather than by what is there To seduce someone is not to impose somerhing it is to set things up so that they do the imposing they make the move they fill the void left by the seduction itself In Baudrillards view if there is such a thing as power in our current situation of hyperreality it operates not by production but by seduction against Foucaults functional vis ion in terms of relays and transmissions we must say that power is something that is exchanged Not in an economical sense bur in the sense that power is executed accord ing to a reversible cycle of seduction challenge and ruse   power seduces by that reversibility which haunts it and upon which a minimal symbolic cycle is set up 13 The reversibil iry of seduction is Baudrillards answer to the question of how to resist power Seduction is a game It is a game that can be played by either side In fact the complexiry of this game is such that it can become unclear who is seducing and who is being seduced The law of seduction takes the form of an uninterrupted ritual exchange where seducer and seduced constantly raise the stakes in a game that never ends And cannot end since the dividing line that defines the victory of the one and the defeat of the other is illegible 14 Baudrillard substitutes the game of seduction for the couple power resistance in Foucault Rather than a power that impresses itself against the resistance it meets in reality there are the reversible lures of seduction that work without reference to a realiry that wou ld coalesce them In a world of simulation it is seduction rather than power that is the motor of po litical and social movement and exchange Seduction has no reference to realiry and nothing within it ever becomes solid or stable Seduction  never belongs to the order of nature but that of artifice  never to the order of energy but that of signs and rituals Foucaults genealogy of power remains stuck in the previous historical epoch the epoch that ended wi th the rise of simulation and hyperrealnty We are governed not 140 ARE WE STILl WHO FOUCAUlT SAYS WE ARE by relations of power but by the seduction of images in a game without end that we too participate in  JeanFranois Lyotard s The Postmodern Condition is perhaps the most famous of all discussions of postmodernism The Postmodern Condition is commissioned in the late 1970s by the Quebecois government as a report on the current state of knowledge The themes of rhe book however have been taken to have much broader app lication than just the ep istemic one In the book Lyotard defines postmodernism as incredulity toward metanarratives 16 This definition which he admits at the outset oversimplifies matters points towards an attirude that characterizes posnnodern movements in literarure art academics and politics We might put rhe core idea this way Humaniry has for much of irs history seen itse lf in rhe context of a larger narrative in which each of our lives is an element This larger narrat ive brings together the smaller narratives that const itute our knowledge of ourselves and our world In that way it is a metanarrative a narrative under whose umbrella other epistemic and moral narratives find their place For much of human history  at least recorded human history  our meta narratives have been rel igious in nature During recent centuries however other meranarratives have come to compete with and often to replace religion Lyorard points to two metanarratives that have situated our knowledge over the past several centuries One is the Enl ightenment narrative that sees the rise of science as a liberation from the supersti tions of the past The other is the Hegelian metanarrat ive of the spirit coming to selfunderstanding In both cases there is a story about the operation of our knowledge that places it in a broader narrative context One of the ro les and perhaps the major role of this context is to justify our knowledge This just ification is a broad one It is not a justification in the sense that a science experiment justifies a hypothesis Meranarratives justify knowledge by offering it a sense of meaningfulness or significance It is the role that knowledge plays whether it be in the service of coming closer to God or of the liberation of humaniry from superstition or of the process of the spirits coming to know itself that justifies knowledge as a whole The incredulity toward metanarratives that characterizes the postmodern condition is a wariness towards this larger justifying picture In the postmodern condition which is our condition there is a loss o f belief or faith that knowledge can be justified as meaningfu l or sign ificant This leads to a crisis of knowledge since rhe point of epistemic projects now becomes uncertain In The Postmodem Condition Lyotard provides an alternative view of knowledge that he believes will fill the hole left by the decline of metanarrative I would like to focus on another aspect of his thought My concern here is not what Lyorard says might serve as a better just ifier for 141 THE PHILOSOPHY Of FOUCAULT knowledge bur what he says acrua lly does serve as the justifier T he latter has to do with capitalism and the criterion of justification is what Lyorard calls performativity Performariviry has to do nor with moral justification nor with spiritual uplift nor with liberat ion it has to do with resu lts In the absence of a credible meranarrarive what justifies knowledge are the resu lts it can give in terms of efficient app lication to or manipulation of our world What however justifies performariviry Thar is a question that once wou ld have been answered by appeal to a meranarrative Performariviry wou ld be justified by some story in which we saw ourselves playing a role a story that wou ld tell us who we are and at the same time what role performarive knowledge plays in making us who we are Bur there is no narrative li ke that any longer at least none that grips most of us Performativiry must be irs own criterion irs own justifier which is to say that ir is unjustified Even if we can live with performativiry being unjustified however there is still another question that remains unanswered lhich types of performariviry ought ro be fostered This again is a question ro which a metanarrative might offer an answer Lcking that however how have we come to approach it After all efficient functioning depends on what one is trying to be efficient about What are the criteria or the goals that allow us to decide how to direct the performativiry o f our knowledge In The Postmodem Condition Lyotard does nor offer us an answer ro this question bur he begins ro suggest one near the end of his later book The Differend He constructs his answer in terms of the relation of capital ism to rime bur I would like ro simplify it a bit in order to focus on a key phrase Capita lism does not consrirute a universal history iris trying ro consrirure a wo rld marker while deferring ir since it also needs the gaps between national communities 17 A universal history is meranarrative Capital ism does not supply a metanarrative It supplies a world marker What govern a world marker are not values of the kind one might find in a meranarrarive values that confer meaning or sign ificance W hat governs a world marker is exchange In the void left by the loss of meta narratives capitalism has stepped in and offered exchange as the gu id ing standard for performativiry How does it work Those who have studied elementary economics will be famil iar with the operation T hose forms of efficiency to be fostered are those that people are will ing to exchange for Performariviry is to be d irected toward what the market ho lds as valuable and what the market holds as valuable are those things for which people are will ing to exchange something in order to receive or own Stripped to irs essentials performariviry is to be directed towards what people will buy One might want to argue here that the distinction drawn between a universal history and a wo rld marker is misleading In particular the idea that 142 ARE WE STILl WHO FOUCAUlT SAYS WE ARE rhe former embodies values and the other does nor is wrong Does rhe srrucrure of exchange nor embody irs own values perhaps nor rhe values of traditional meranarrarives bm values nonetheless If meranarrarives promore values of service ro God or liberation from superstition does rhe rise of performariviry and particularly o f exchange nor promote rhe va lues of individual choice Can we nor say rhar where once common national or human values reigned values rhar brought us rogerher in a common struggle or destiny now we are beholden ro individualist values rhar are more in keeping with rhe dispersed mulriculrural world in w hich we live The issue is nor one of choice between values and no values bm between rhe rypes of values embraced And if this is t rue is ir nor also true rhar conremporary capitalism does have irs own meranarrarive one involving the rise of individual choice and freedom from culrural or social or national or ideo logical hegemony The objection is a forceful one However I do nor believe rhar ir is in rhe end compel ling lr is nor rhar there is no privileging of individual choice in our world There certainly is And it is nor that rhar privileging is nor held as a value The problem is rhar from the perspective of the individual and particularly rhe ind ividual consumer ir is held as a personal value nor a common one With rhe dominance of exchange each of us believes in our own individual choice Each of us believes rhar we should receive what we desire We do nor hold this as a value for others a value rhar brings us rogerher a value rhar would form rhe basis of a metanarrarive Rather we might say we hold ir as a personal right rather than a un iversal value Moreover from rhe perspective especially of rhe corporations rhar engage in performariviry and rhar drive rhe world marker values are nor an issue Profit is If rhe current world is more in thrall ro a world marker than ro national enriries or traditional meranarrarives then one of rhe results of this has been the decline of the concept of common values generally and the r ise of a profit motive rhar does nor answer the question of what rhar profit is for Its srory ends wirh pro fir nor with any values rhar underl ie ir just as individual choice rests on personal desire rather than on the general value of such choice for humanity In Lyorards introduction of rhe world marker as rhe arbiter of performari viry we can see rhe intersection between his rhoughr and rhar of Hardt and Negri Whereas Hardt and Negri are concerned with rhe srrucrure of forces in rhe emerging transnational world order Lyorard focuses on rhe marker and rhe way performariviry and exchange work in thar marker Both works however see what we might cal l a horizontal integration of markers and transnational entities d isplacing while as rhe quote from Lyorard notes nor entirely replacing rhe old vertical order of national entities rhar confront or interact wirh one another as exterior ro 143 THE PHILOSOPHY Of FOUCAULT one another The rise of transnational entities particularly of transnational corporations has been documented exhaustively in recent years Masao Miyoshi for instance derails in a 1993 article the transition from colonialism to transnational ism particularly with regard to the decline of nationstares and the rise of transnational corporations 18 He argues that transnational corporations are beginning to replace multinational ones as their allegiance to particular nationstares d iminishes and their global mobility increases Miyoshi notes that among rhe effects of the rise of transnational corporations are a loss of concern for the we lfare of indigenous populations a homogenization of wealthier classes across national borders a greater disp lacement of workers who fo llow the migration of jobs environmental degradation arising from a lack of concern about local conditions and a cooptation of academic institutions to which transnational corporations provide funding and from which they receive expertise If we think of the structure of control that Deleuze depicts the transnational structure delineated by Hardt and Negri and the rise of performativiry based on exchange that Lyorard d iscusses these effects of rransnationalism wil l nor seem foreign to us From another angle we can also see the intersection between Lyorard s thought and Baudrillards early inversion of Marx ism Recall that before Baudrillards turn toward hyperrealiry he argues that Marxs focus on production should be turned around It is consumerism nor production that forms the core of contemporary capitalism Alongside the rise of rransnationalism the emergence of consumerism is another effect of the substitution of performativiry and exchange for the values embedded in meranarrarives This might seem un likely After all one might ask is nor performativiry a matter of production rather than consumption Does it nor have to do with efficiency in what is made regardless of the ultimate point of making it On the other hand what gu ides performativity is exchange It is consumption that determines wlhar is to be produced If Lyorard is right here then people think of who r hey are more centrally in terms of what they consume than in terms of what they make It is the houses they live in the cars they drive the clothes they wear the restaurants they ear in that determine who they are to themselves rather than the jobs they do Performarivity yes but performariviry in the service of consumption Lyorards thought then like that of both Deleuze and Baudrillard argues that we have entered a new historical period There is a break what Foucault might call a historical discontinuity between earlier historical epochs and the one we are inhabiting now We are no longer who we were thirty or even twenty years ago Whether the stress on who we are now should be placed on the structure of the world we live in irs increasingly 144 ARE WE STILl WHO FOUCAUlT SAYS WE ARE virtual and mediated character or the loss of meranarrarives in favour of performari viry and exchange we must recognize that histories that deposit us in the mid1970s can no longer account for who we are A new chapter or a set of new chapters must be written The genealogies must be extended Ye are no longer who Foucault says we are There is much to consider here In order to address these ideas adequately l would like to proceed in three stages First it would be worth addressing each proposal individually from a Foucauldian perspective Each l think has shortcomings in as much as it proposes that we have moved beyond Foucaults though t We must bear in mind however that Lyorard does nor address Foucaults thought directly so we are read ing that idea into his perspective Secondly the three proposals share a commonal ity in their approach that make them in an important way disriner from Foucaults own approach I wou ld like to show that from Foucaults perspective this commonaliry is a weakness in as much as these approaches are attempts to account for who we are now Finally however I believe that it is undeniable that the changes these thinkers discuss are important ones I would like to recognize that by appeal to the lectures that Foucault gives at the College de France in 1979 These lectures which have just been published and as of this wri ting remain untranslared can be read as a contribution to the historical changes Deleuze Baudri llard and Lyorard discuss T his contribution offers a d ifferent stress from that of each of the other three However it is po inting in a direction that would nor be entirely foreign to the intersection of their t hough t Deleuze argues that we now live in a sociery o f control Our lives are characterized by a lack of particular enclosures a new temporal rhythm codes instead of normalization and meraproducrion We have already seen that Foucault is ready to concede the decline of particular enclosures as a sire of discipline Should he be ready to concede rhar discipline itself has been surpassed T he question hinges on the relevance of normalization Deleuze argues that we live in the modu lating flux of codes rather than the individualizing discipline of normalization Has rhe former replaced the latter or is normalization still an important force roday l do nor see a decl ine in the power of normalizaruon In fact the situation may well be the opposite Normalization rather than giving way to codes seems both to exist a longside them and at rimes to be a necessary support for them If we think of normalization arising from discipline in particular spaces we can perhaps see a bit of a decline Bur it is easy even to overstate this T hink for instance of the operation of schools one of the central sires of discipl ine Diagnoses of Attention Deficit Hyperacriviry Disorder ADHD in its various psychological subtypes have at least in the United States not declined They have increased19 They are as rampant as the 145 THE PHilOSOPHY Of

stretch is d iagnosed med icated and brought back imo rhe fold of quiescem conformism ro school romines This is discipline in irs class ic form However if we move away from tradi tional discipl ine we can still see normalization ar work During rhe recem presidemial election in rhe United Stares rhe issue of moral values was thought of as a cenrral one I live in the state of South Carol ina a heartland of such values Chief among these are what has come to be called fami ly vaUues Family values have nothing ro do with supporting famil ies T hey do nor concern such issues as financial or social assistance for working mothers nmririon and health care for ch ildren educational opportunities or re lief for impoverished fami lies They have ro do with promoting what some consider the idea l strucrure of a family That srrucrure consists of a man usually as the primary wage earner a woman and children the Malthusian couple Particularly ana rhema are single mothers hysterical women and gay couples perverted adults Nor ro menrion the perennial problem of the masmrbaring child If we think of Foucaults analyses of sexuality in the first vo lume of his history we should nor be surprised rhar homosexuality and abortion are cemral among the issues rhar exercise Christian pastors These sexual maHers are taken robe cenrral determinams of who we are To be a homo sexual in the United States is to be defined by ones sexual orienration It is ro have ones idemity reduced ro a single set of desires Even in the South where many people refuse ro consider Catholicism a form of Christianity rhe cominuiry of belief with rhe changes in rhe Catholic confessional in the sevemeemh cenntry is unmistakable Moreover one can see as well rhe operation of power as Foucault analyses ir In as much as gays rake up their sexual idemity as cenrral forming gay communities with their own inregriry and practices they become what rhe operat ion of sexual ity makes them people defined by the character of their desire In the disciplinary operation of schools and in the rheological approach ro sexuality we can see the process of normalization at work Codes have nor replaced normalization they operate alongside of it Further normal ization helps support rhe rise of certain codes Remrn ro rhe example of fashion we used earlier to understand how codes operate A shoe designer goes ro rhe inner city with differem shoe models and asks the dominam males in various urban groups to evaluate them This may seem like a movemem away from normalization It is certainly a nnovemem away from discipline in irs classic form However in order for this method of shoe design ro work it requires a differem type of normalization It requires a comergence between shoe design marketing techniques and dominan t urban 146 ARE WE STILl WHO FOUCAUlT SAYS WE ARE males This convergence creates a set of norms that although nor d iscipl inary are certa inly as forcefu l in their way as the normalizarion that arises from discipline One might wanr to object here that this last example is nor one of normalization bur simply of conformity Is normalization as Foucault depicts it nor a more precise practice or set of practices involving the inrervention inro behaviour through hierarchical observation norma lizing judgement and examination Yie might see these operations at play in currenr rheological practices in regard ro sexuality bur is it not a stretch to see them in support of the rypes of codes Deleuze d iscusses I do nor believe that it is Through the development of technology people see themselves mirrored or nor mirrored through the images they are presenred with Those images in league with people around them present a normalizing force that in a d ifferent way from traditional discipl ine retains al l three elements Hierarchical observation becomes comparison of oneself with the images one sees and with ones peers and superiors Normalizing judgemenr and examination come from those same sources And even if the processes of judgement and examination are more informal nevertheless they apply ro as minure elemenrs of behaviour as those intervened upon in the training of Prussian soldiers Normal ization has nor been replaced by codes bur exists with them at rimes in collaboration and at rimes independenr of the movement of codes The rise of codes has certainly changed the character of some normalizing procedures in particular with regard to the enclosed spaces associated with traditional discipl ine bur it has nor replaced normalization Turn ing ro Baudrillard we must ask whether indeed we live in hyperreality Baudrillard has a penchant one that the reader will no doubt have noticed and that many readers of Baudrillard have commented on for staring his posirion in irs mosr exrreme form  As a rherorical ploy rhis is effective and it al lows him to create striking formulations such as the one on the ro le of Disneyland Foucaults approach however is more measured So we must ask whether the hyperreal iry Baudrillard posits indeed caprures the world we live in  This is nor a question of whether our experiences have become increasingly mediated by electronic technology lr would be foolish ro deny that they are or that they have taken a leap in this direction since the publication of Foucaults first volume on the history of sexuality Rather the quest ion is do we live in hyperreal iry The answer here it seems to me is no The reason for this is that contra Baudrillard the referent of images sti ll has an importanr role ro play in our interaction with the world Yihat images are or purport to be images of still matters And as long as this remains the case our experience cannot accurately be described as one of hyperreal ity 147 THE PHilOSOPHY OF FOUCAULT Although it is true that the power of the media to shape peoples perceptions is far greater than it once was it is also true that people hope the med ia offers an accurate portrayal of the world they live in Critiques of the media are often formulated in terms of misleading or false portrayals of world evems For instance one of the cemral justificat ions for Presidem Bush s initiation of war against Iraq concerns the claim that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction a claim we now know to be false It is the comparison of what the Presidem claimed and the media dmifully repon ed with what mrned om acntally ro be the case char is the heart of the matter here This seems to undercm Baudrillard s view that we inhabit a world of hyperrealiry However perhaps we should rake a subtler look What Baudrillard might argue here is char the example as I have presemed ir ignores an imporram aspect of what happened It is nor he migh t say the nonexistence of weapons of mass destruction char maners Rather the cemral point is that chis nonexistence was brought before rhe media and is still kept al ive in the media Reporters refer to ir talk show pundits analyse ir anchorpeop le use it as a touchstone of their repon ing on the administrations policy in Iraq Should the Bush administrat ion have been successful in covering up the nonexistence of the purponed weapons the fact of their nonexistence would nor maner lr would nor figure in the configuration of our experience It would be as though there had indeed been weapons of mass destruction in Iraq and the United Scares had found them Their absence would be irrelevam In this way it is the images that determine our world nor the reality to which these images refer Pm this way Baudrillards poim is powerful bm at the expense of becoming a historical If people are led to believe something false by whatever means and cannot have access to the rrmh then that rrmh will remain foreign to their experience They will be unable to reflect or act upon what is really the case T his poim does nor apply simply ro comemporary society bm to all societies It is a broad philosophical poim rather than a historical marker of our rime Moreover the poim itself does nor support the idea char the reality referred to by images is no longer of momem Instead it makes the more modest claim that often people do nor have access to that real ity None of this is meam to deny that in a world where electronic media play such an important ro le images are often taken for real ity nor that one of the most prevalem ways that reality is distorted or hidden is through the media Rather the idea is char although Baudrillards claim that Foucaults view of power remains trapped within a reality principle may be true that wou ld be a poim in Foucaults favour rather than Baudrillards We may live in a world where images play a far more imporram role in 148 ARE WE STILl WHO FOUCAUlT SAYS WE ARE determining our experience than they once did We do nor however live in a hyperreal ity The stakes for Foucault in this d iscussion are enormous For instance if we did live in hyperreal ity among the things that would become irrelevant are our bodies Ir is what we see rather than any intervention of the world on our bodies that determines who we are That is why seduction wou ld be a preferred strategy of resistance it does nor refer ro bodies bur instead to a suggestiveness that has no corporeal form In Foucaults view power often operates at the level of the body Both discipl ine and sexual ity centrally involve a relation of various practices to our bodies Perhaps what is necessary here is nor as Baudril lard would have it a claim that practices of power oriented towards our bodies have passed away bur instead an analysis of the role images play in determining the orientation and character of our bodies What have our bodies become in the wake of the rise of electronic media and irs images And what does that say abour who we have become T hese it seems are the relevant questions There are many ways to address them and among those ways a Foucaulrian genealogy might not be entirely beside the point Turning to Lyorard we must ask after his concept of posrmodernity and particularly after the role that capita lism plays in replacing meta narratives with exchange Ir is probably worth noting in passing that this replacement although distinct from Deleuzes claim that normal izarion is being replaced by codes has affinities with it In particular there is a relation between the idea of unfenered exchange and that of codes20 Before turning to capita lism however it is worth lingering a moment over an important similarity between Lyotard s view and Foucaults Lyotard believes that the posrmodern world exhibits a wariness toward meta narratives No single overarching story about who or where we are or are headed compels peoples assent Foucault in turn jettisons overarching views of who we are particularly in his genealogies He sees who we are as a result of the intersection of a number of threads of practice threads whose weave forms nor a single panern bur many Moreover for Foucault the operation of power in the modern age has become increas ingly dispersed It is no longer primarily the repressive execise of several centuries ago It is increasingly a creative force that emerges through various and often unrelated practices In this sense both Lyorard and Foucault are looking at our world with a similar eye Although Lyorard grounds his view in the twentieth century and Foucault rakes a longer view there are resonances between their approaches In this resonance however there is a discordance that distinguishes their views Lyorard values the loss of the grand narrative if nor the capitalism that has commandeered that loss For him incredul ity toward 149 THE PHilOSOPHY O f FOUCAULT meranarrarives opens our onto nove l ways of living It allows for a recognition of competing narratives and for respect for different genres of discourse different ways of conducting speech and engaging in language  from the episremic to the moral to the aesthetic In The Differend for instance one of his criticisms of contemporary capitalism is that it blunts the power of genres reducing them all to the sing le d iscourse of exchange Although the loss of the grand narrative has created a space in which different smal ler narratives could flourish capitalism has filled that space by translating all narratives into matters of exchange and rhus closed the possibility that postmodernism opens Foucaul t by contrast does nor turn to the d ispersion of practices in order to find something ro value We might pur the point by saying that his orientation in contrast ro Lyorards is analytic rather than normative It is nor because there is something of value in the loss of an overarching theme or narrative that Foucault focuses his attention on minor everyday practices lr is because rhar is where we are being created If we want to understand who we are now and in particular how we have been made to be who we are now then we need to look on the ground rather than from some overarching perspective The various and d ispersed practices that constitute the current aerher of our lives are not necessari ly better than anything offered by a grand narrative As we have seen in many cases they are intolerable For Foucault then in contrast ro Lyorard there is no privileging of smaller practices in contrast ro larger ones informing his embrace of the derails of our history There is instead the projecr of asking about the character of our present T his discordance leads ro his divergence from Lyorard Lyorard worries that contemporary capitalist ways of thinking and acting have subsumed and reduced others to their own parameters Foucault wou ld be uncomfortable with this view He need nor deny the imiPorrance of the discourse of exchange or of the related phenomena of globalization and transnational capitalism any more than he need deny the place of codes or images in constituting who we are now In fact as we shall see Foucault has a contribution to make to the d iscussion of contemporary views of capital ism Rather it wou ld be Lyorards insistence on the primacy of exchange that runs afoul of Foucaults analytic scruples If what I said above in response to Deleuze about the persistence of projects of normalization is r ight then there are indeed forms of discourse that are both outside rlhe genre of exchange and pol itically o ppressive or intolerable Neither al l discourse nor all pol itically charged d iscourse is in the process of being reduced to the capitalist discourse of exchange that Lyorard describes Although much d iscourse intersects with capitalism each has irs own parameters its OIIVIl integrity and requires its OIIVIl treatment if it is 150 ARE WE STILl WHO FOUCAUlT SAYS WE ARE co be understood This is the sal ience of Foucaults appeal to smaller discourses as an analytic rather than normative end eavour The picture of capitalism on the one side and smaller better genres on the other must give way to a picture of various intersecting genres with capital ism dominating in some playing a minor role in others and being nearly absent in others sti ll The problem with Lyorards approach and it is a problem common to all three announcements of a new era is that it seeks co account for who we have become in terms of a single register Deleuze Baudrillard and Lyotard look for the one thing that has made us who we are now as distinct from who we were twenty or thirty years ago Codes as distinct from discipl ine hyperreality and seduction as distinct from reality and power rhe capitalist genre of exchange each of these is posited co account for who we have become In rhe first rwo cases where rhe contrast with Foucault is stared rhe authors posit a false symmetry between their thought and Foucaults They operate by way of saying  No it isnt rhar rs this Bur that is nor how Foucault operates Discipline is on ly one among rhe forces that have made us who we are And Foucault does nor contra Baudrillards reading see everything as a matter of power Multipl icity s inherent in Foucaults approach and has been since the beginning In rhar sense a historical cri ticism of Foucaults approach would more likelly be of moment than a broad philosophically oriented criticism rhar seeks to subsume particulars under an overarching structure At least a historical criticism if it were not in the service of a broad phi losophical agenda need not posit rhe approach of a particular one of his works as a microcosm of his larger view The problem common to these three approaches is rhar they rake a birdseye view They glide far above the realities that make us who we are This is what allows them to reduce the complexity of our historically formed present to a single explanation or a single factor It is nor rhar they see nothing of who we are To the contrary they offer acute insights into our current condition The problem is rhar they try ro rake in roo much at a glance If we are co follow the lesson of Foucault s methodology we need co return to the ground and investigate rhe space in which we live Genealogy is grey and patiently documentary it is nor bright and reducrively explanatory In this sense the projects of Deleuze Baudrillard and Lyorard are al igned with those of Descartes Freud and Marx They are looking for the key explanatory factor rather than investigating rhe world in irs proper dispersion This is not co say that their thought is in all ways continuous with those of Foucaults predecessors Far from it For instance each of the three recent thinkers focuses on rhe character of our present rather than on a timeless essence However they share with those earl ier thinkers a 151 THE PHilOSOPHY O f FOUCAULT commitment to a single explainer and in that commitment they have not yet reached Foucault must less gone beyond him  One might want to face Foucault straight on here however and argue that his problem is precisely that his thought is one of dispersion One might say that our wo rld has indeed changed radically so radically that there now is a single explanation for who we are a single account that can be given of our present It might be the account that Deleuze offers or that of Baudrillard or Lyotard Or it may be some combination of the three It may be that we live in a world of t ransnational capitalism that is guided by codes mediated through a hyperreality and in the process of reducing all discourse to that of capita list exchange Perhaps each of these thinkers has caugh t an aspect of the larger web in which we are now caught In any case and this wou ld be the crucial point it is a s ingle web and no longer the myriad of intersecting but d istinct practices Foucault describes Globalization and technologica l development have deposited us on new shores shores that are characterized by a single coastline and a common inland T hat is where we live now I have suggested by way of criticizing each of the thinkers that there are reasons to believe otherwise For instance normalization seems to be a more dispersed set of projects than a single explanation wou ld have us bel ieve However in the face of this possibi lity these remain merely suggestions In order to resolve this disagreement we would have to go much further further indeed than can be gone in this book What wou ld be required in order to answer the question of whether who we are now is subject to a single account There would need to be a stttdy of the kinds of texts Foucault relies on on ly focused on the past thirty years or so in order to see what they yield For instance if we were to ask about the relation of sexual ity to global ization and the electronic media we would have to investigate sex manuals sexual advice and pornography on the Internet practices of sexual counselling sex education in schools church discourse on sex cl inical and theoretical approaches to sexual deviances the role of the confessional and the appeal to sex by po liticians among other sources in order to understand the changes that have occurred since the first volume of Foucaults history of sexuality We would have to ask of these texts and practices what kinds of norms andor codes andor values they promote how they relate to previous texts and practices with what other tex ts and practices they intersect what their role is in contemporary capitalism how the electronic media affect our interaction with them and what the consequences of all this have been In short we would have to do a genealogy or rather a number of genealogies If there is a single account of who we are now if our world has gone beyond the one Foucault describes then we shall have to discover this by 152 ARE WE STILl WHO FOUCAUlT SAYS WE ARE means of a Foucauldian methodology To proclaim the existence of a new era wirhour engaging in the parienr labour of arch ivai work is nor to have gone beyond Foucault bur instead nor yer to have

project In rwo lecture courses ar the College de France offered in 1977 78 Securite territoire population and 1978 79 Naissance de Ia biopolitique Foucault traces rhe history of what he calls govemmentality from irs beginnings in rhe sixteenth century up unri l rhe middle of rhe rwenrierh century Foucault sees these lectures as a conrriburion to his project on biopolirics rhar we discussed above He focuses on rhe practice of governmenr particularly as ir passes from rhe more pastoral mode of the Christ ian medieval period ro the early modern and then contemporary period What is particu larly striking for currenr purposes is rhe second set of lectures in which Fouculr discusses rhe rise of neol iberalism Ir is to my knowledge Foucaults on ly extended discussion of rwenrierhcemury history In these lectures he rraces rhe rise of earlyrwenrierhcemury neoliberalism in among posrSecond World War German thinkers and irs appropriation more recently in US rhoughr Those of us who live in rhe Englishspeaking world will recogn ize immediately rhe rhemes rhar characterize rhis discussion Governmenraliry as Foucault defines ir has li rtle ro do with po litical ph ilosophy Ir does nor

of governmenr How ought governmenr ro be done Vhar are irs proper roles Whose benefit oughr ir ro seek and how These are rhe driving 153 THE PHilOSOPHY O f FOUCAUlT questions o f governmental iry Foucault defines govern mentality as involving three things first an ensemble formed by the institutions procedures analyses and reflections concerning a complex form of power which has as irs target population as irs principal form of knowledge political economy and as irs essential technical means apparatuses of security  secondly a tendency toward the preeminence of this type of power and thirdly the process of the transformation toward this preeminence Gov 102 3 It requ ires the substitution o f the idea of power for that of institutions of strategies for that of govern men tal functions and of the creation of a field of objects for the assumption of preexistent objects STP 12021 We can see here that the project of studying governmental iry is continuous with Foucaults genealogical method Focusing on practices rather than abstract theory oriented toward issues of power and positing the erearion of objects through power rather than accepting their preexistence Foucaults lectures on governmental iry are of a piece with his preceding work Over the course of the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries a practice of governmental iry arises that is concerned with the power of the state on the one hand and the rights of the individual citizen on the other T he stare particularl y irs administ ration th rough what Foucault calls the police seeks to draw the most our of the resources of irs citizens as well as concern itself with their proper wellbeing Here we must undesrand the concept of police in a broader sense than the everyday one Pol icing is nor simply a matter of providing internal security through an armed force It involves all those measures that are directed toward state and citizen wellbeing from censusraking to hea lth policy to security to education The police ensure a viral state through and alongside their knowledge of and intervention into the population a concept that arises at the same rime as that of the stare Vle might think of the sexual measures developed as a result of population studies as policing in this sense Over and against the propriety of state policing stands the concept of individua l rights T he realm of rights constitutes the area in which the stare and irs police cannot intervene T he space o f rights is one might say a free zone immune from the powers that might otherwise overwhelm the individual Much discussion of governmental iry during this period is centred on the shape of that free zone irs extent and irs limits wh ich are correspondingly the extent and limits of governmental intervention Early into the emergence of this type of governmental iry however there exists alongside it an economic view that will eventually come to compere with it This view migh t be summed up in Adam Smiths image of the invisible hand For these thinkers it is impossible for the government to have 154 AR E WE STILl WHO FOUCAU lT SAYS WE ARE the proper knowledge of the population particularly with regard to the mechanisms of the economy requ ired to imervene in the r ight way co optimize state flourishing Rather chan pol ice imervemion what is required is a ce rtain scare modesty a willingness to allow certain things rather than promoting them in order co achieve its proper goals Recall here Adam Smiths idea char if everyone is allowed to act freely in their own imeresc at least in the realm of production and t rade everyone will wind up bener off It should be stressed and we shall return to chis poim chat this competing view which is indeed char of liberal ism does not substitute individual freedom for state imervemion lc does nor enlarge the realm of individual action and shrink chat of the scare Rather it shifts the types of imervencions the state can make from chose of traditional policing co chose of ensuring that the proper mechanisms of the market are in place and allowed to operate W hat are the characteristics of chis early liberalism Foucault cites three veridiction of the market limitation by the calculus of governmemal miliry and   the position of Europe as a region of economic developmem un limited by relationship co a world market NB 62 The idea here is char in comrasr co earlier economic views liberalism posies first that the market is no longer a space of justice bm one of tru th It is no longer a matter of ensuring chat exchange relations are just recall the early Christian critique of moneylending as usury but of understanding how they work in order co maximize their beneficence Secondly that understanding requires a limitation on govern me mal imervemion imo the market Thirdly knowledge of the operation of the market shows that economics is not a zerosum game W inners do not arise at the expense of necessary losers This is the lesson of Smiths invisible hand everyone can win th rough proper market cooperation Liberal ism Foucault poims our reverses the trad itional relationship between the state and the market Now rather than milizing the market in order to profit the scare the scare is seen as needing co support the mechanisms of the market This does not mean that the state necessarily assumes a secondary importance although this may happen  rather that the cont inued health of the state requ ires that it no longer engage in the earl ier project of policing It is in poseSecond World War Germany that I iberalism in irs comemporary and highly influemial form begins Ordo liberalism which had begun to be developed in the prewar period by thinkers such as Wi lhelm Ropke comes to dominate d iscussions of rebui lding the German scare Ordoliberalism answers to a question char arises for Germany in the aftermath of the war It is a quest ion char is the opposite of the one most stares 155 THE PHILOSOPHY Of FOUCAULT face T he problem for rhe already exisrenr stares is rhar o f asking how ro limit stare power in order ro create a space o f free exchange The Germans had rhe exact inverse problem ro resolve Given rhar a stare does nor exist how ro make ir exist starring from rhis nonstare space which is one of economic liberty NB 88 The ordoliberals answer rhar one must create a stare rhar supports rhe marker rather rhan the reverse This answer has resonances for those engaged in rhe reconstruction of postwar Germany because by submitting rhe srare ro rhe marker ir forms ar rhe same rime a critique of stare power Ordoliberals argue rhar stares by their narure seek power and rhar o ffering stares t he power ro inrervene in rhe lives of people will lead rhem down a road rhar ends in totalitarianism Thus rhe idea of a more limited stare appeals ro those who have been rhe object o f German fascism Bur their critique is more poimed Purring power particularly economic power in rhe hands of any stare is a step down rhe road roward roralirarianism There is a conrinu iry between rhe New Deal and Nazism rhar lies in rhe concenrrarion of power in rhe stare Vhar is requ ired is a stare under rhe surveillance of the marker rather rhan a marker under rhe survei llance of rhe stare ibid 120 T his idea is picked up in rhe United Stares by rhe theorists who form rhe early vanguard of neoliberal ism Foucault emphasizes rhar neoliberal doctrine is nor a doctrine of noninrervenrion by rhe stare lr requires noninrervenrion inro rhe direct workings of the marker However there are a number of inrervenrions rhar can be made into rhe framework rhar supports rhe marker T he ordoliberals pose rhe question ir being given rhar the processes o f economicopol itical regulation are nor and can nor be those of rhe marker how can one modify material culrura l technical and juridica l bases rhar are given in Europe ibid 146 T he neoliberals answer rhis question by positing individuals as homo oeconomiws and designing social pol icy from rhar assumption Who is homo oeconomicus He is rhe person orienred toward marker production and exchange He seeks ro maximize his welfare by means of making rhe best use of his resources and his environment He is in short a capitalist in all aspects of his life He sees rhe projects of his life in terms of enrerprises rhar requires certain inpurs and have l he possibi lity of yielding particular benefits Foucault offers examples of this way of thinking by American neoliberals in ch ildraising work and other areas Ir would perhaps be worth drawing our his analysis of Gary Beckers neoliberal rrearmenr of criminal ity since ir provides a conrrasr ro disciplinary mode ls Foucault discusses in Discipline and Punish For Becker a criminal is someone who is calculating rhe benefits and costs of committing crimes In facr he defines a crime as any action rhar makes an individual run rhe risk of being condemned ro a penalty peine 156 ARE WE STILl WHO FOUCAUlT SAYS WE ARE ibid 256 The quest ion facing those who design such penalties then is one of how to create penalties that can deter crimes Penalties are thought of as negative externalities they are what are like ly to accompany crimes but as unwanted sideeffects at least in the criminals view The penal system then must design negative externalities that will have the maxmimum deterrence value Of course deterrence itself has costs to the system These are opportunity costs resources that are diverted from other possible social purposes to those of deterring crime So the state must consider the best balance between gaining deterrence by placing negative externalities on the one hand and losing opportunities by a diversion of resources on the other Those costs are then integrated into a supplydemand curve relative to crime The enforcement of the law is the ensemble of instruments of action on the criminal market that oppose to the snpply o f crime a negative demand ibid 260 We are far removed here from the realm of discipline Where d iscip line seeks to focus on each individual in order to modify their behaviour neolibera lism attends to the general supply of crime Where d iscipline works through training and normalization neoliberal ism works through a calculation of rewards and costs Where discipline assumes a pliable body that can be intervened upon neo libera lism assumes a homo oeconomicus Where discipl ine seeks to el iminare crime neoliberalism seeks an equilibrium between the supply curve of crime and negative demand ibid 26 1 In short in contrast to discipline and normalization neolibera lism seeks a society in which there would be optlllliZation of systems of difference  in which there wou ld be action taken not upon the players but on the rules of play and finally in which there wou ld be an intervention which would not be a type of subjectivization asmjettissement interna l to individuals but instead an intervention of an envi ronmental kind ibid 265 What are we to make of Foucaults analysis of neoliberal ism First it should be noted that Foucault emphasizes that rhe neoliberal approach remains in 1979 marginal to mainstream discourse It is not that neeliberalism has rep laced d iscip line and normalization rather it has arisen as a form of govern mentality that competes with it Foucault is measuring the rise of a view of the world of human beings of governing and of economy that at the time he offers his lectures is beginn ing to have an impact As we know the twin emergence of globalization and electronic media has helped neoliberal doctrine move more rowards the mainstream 157 THE PHilOSOPHY OF FOUCAULT of po litical and economic governmenra liry In this sense Foucault has foreseen changes rhar have become more sal ienr since the writing of Discipline and Punish These changes converge with those srudied by Deleuze Baudrillard and Lyorard al though with rwo imporranr di fferences First they are seen as a strand albeit an imporranr one in th inking abour who and where we are now T he neoliberal approach is nor taken to be the whole cloth Although Deleuze can admit rhar codes have nor enrirel rep laced normalization Foucault by siruaring his analyses closer to the ground can show it And by keeping ro the genea logical method Foucaul t can ask more precise questions abour the place of neolibera lism in crea ting who we are and how we think of ourselves than those thinkers who srand above or ourside the derai ls of our history It is true rhar since 1979 the place of neoliberal ism has become far less marginal than it was in Foucaults rime Bur again this means that we need to conrinue his analyses nor abandon them T he second difference and here the con trast with Baudrillard is particularl y acure is rhar in the neo liberal view that Foucault describes homo oeconomicus is not so much a consumer as an enrerprising capitalist Homo oeconomicus   is not the man of exchange he is not the consuming man he is the man of enrerprise and of production ibid  152 Yie must be careful here Foucault is nor saying that who we have become is enrirely homo oeconomicus Nor only is neoliberal theory nor in the ascendance in 1979 but also the approach embraced by neoliberals must be placed alongside other threads in order to reveal the character and even the biopolirica l character of our world It is enrrely possible rhar in one sense we are becoming consumers as much as producers and in another we are becoming capitalist enrrepreneurs For instance Presidenr Bush s recenr vision of an ownership society for all irs hypocrisy is an idea that needs to be investigated from both the consumerist and the entrepreneurial perspectives My claim is not that Baudrillard is wrong here bur that Foucaults conrriburion is nor reducible to his It approaches the emergence of who we are from a differenr angle We are left then wi th the question of who we are now In this chapter we have surveyed those who would leave Foucault behind and I have argued that there is still much to be gleaned from using Foucaults works and particularly his method Yie have seen that Foucaul ts conrriburions conrinue to have a grip on us Whoever we are we have not entirely shed who we were nor has it been established that we have become something unified that can be placed under a single descriptive or analytical category Yie have not however settled the question of who we are now If Foucault is right then we cannot appeal to his works uncritically in order to understand ourse lves We are historical beings conringenr and changeable If we 158 ARE WE STILl WHO FOUCAUl T SAYS WE ARE are to understand who we are who we are now it remains to us to ask the question closely and vigi lantly To discover who we are to become who we might be these are projects we are never done with In that sense Foucaults work lies nor on ly wi th our past and with our present bur with our future as well  159 Notes Chapter 1 Introduction who a re we 1 Gilles Dclcuzc Empiricism aud Subjectivity An Essay on Humcs Tl1eory of Human Nature C V Boundas trans New York

<BOS> <BOS> 7192020 Broken Wings by Kahlil GibrannewthoughtlibrarycomgibranKhalilbrokenWings 120Broken Wings by Kahlil GibranForewordI was eighteen years of age when love opened my eyes with its magic rays and touched my spirit for the first time with its fieryfingers and Selma Karamy was the first woman who awakened my spirit with her beauty and led me into the garden of highaffection where days pass like dreams and nights like weddingsSelma Karamy was the one who taught me to worship beauty by the example of her own beauty and revealed to me the secret of loveby her affection se was the one who first sang to me the poetry of real lifeA very young man remembers his first love and tries to recapture that strange hour the memory of which changes his deepest feelingand makes him so happy in spite of all the bitterness of its mysteryIn every young mans life there is a Selma who appears to him suddenly while in the spring of life and transforms his solitude intohappy moments and fills the silence of his nights with musicI was deeply engrossed in thought and contemplation and seeking to understand the meaning of nature and the revelation of booksand scriptures when I heard LOVE whispered into my ears through Selmas lips My life was a coma empty like that of Adams inParadise when I saw Selma standing before me like a column of light She was the Eve of my heart who filled it with secrets andwonders and made me understand the meaning of lifeThe first Eve led Adam out of Paradise by her own will while Selma made me enter willingly into the paradise of pure love and virtueby her sweetness and love but what happened to the first man also happened to me and the fiery word which chased Adam out ofParadise was like the one which frightened me by its glittering edge and forced me away from paradise of my love without havingdisobeyed any order or tasted the fruit of the forbidden treeToday after many years have passed I have nothing left out of that beautiful dream except painful memories flapping like invisiblewings around me filling the depths of my heart with sorrow and bringing tears to my eyes and my beloved beautiful Selma is deadand nothing is left to commemorate her except my broken heart and tomb surrounded by cypress trees That tomb and this heart areall that is left to bear witness of SelmaThe silence that guards the tomb does not reveal Gods secret in the obscurity of the coffin and the rustling of the branches whoseroots suck the bodys elements do not tell the mysteries of the grave by the agonized sighs of my heart announce to the living thedrama which love beauty and death have performedOh friends of my youth who are scattered in the city of Beirut when you pass by the cemetery near the pine forest enter it silentlyand walk slowly so the tramping of your feet will not disturb the slumber of the dead and stop humbly by Selmas tomb and greet theearth that encloses her corpse and mention my name with deep sigh and say to yourself here all the hopes of Gibran who is livingas prisoner of love beyond the seas were buried On this spot he lost his happiness drained his tears and forgot his smileAy that tomb grows Gibrans sorrow together with the cypress trees and above the tomb his spirit flickers every nightcommemorating Selma joining the branches of the trees in sorrowful wailing mourning and lamenting the going of Selma whoyesterday was a beautiful tune on the lips of life and today is a silent secret in the bosom of the earthOh comrades of my youth I appeal to you in the names of those virgins whom your hearts have loved to lay a wreath of flowers onthe forsaken tomb of my beloved for the flowers you lay on Selmas tomb are like falling drops of dew for the eyes of dawn on theleaves of withering roseReturn to the Top Return to the Top7192020 Broken Wings by Kahlil GibrannewthoughtlibrarycomgibranKhalilbrokenWings 220Chapter 1  Silent SorrowMy neighbors you remember the dawn of youth with pleasure and regret its passing but I remember it like a prisoner who recallsthe bars and shackles of his jail You speak of those years between infancy and youth as a golden era free from confinement andcares but I call those years an era of silent sorrow which dropped as a seed into my heart and grew with it and could find no outlet tothe world of Knowledge and wisdom until love came and opened the hearts doors and lighted its corners Love provided me with atongue and tears You people remember the gardens and orchids and the meeting places and street corners that witnessed yourgames and heard your innocent whispering and I remember too the beautiful spot in North Lebanon Every time I close my eyes Isee those valleys full of magic and dignity and those mountains covered with glory and greatness trying to reach the sky Every time Ishut my ears to the clamor of the city I hear the murmur of the rivulets and the rustling of the branches All those beauties which Ispeak of now and which I long to see as a child longs for his mothers breast wounded my spirit imprisoned in the darkness ofyouth as a falcon suffers in its cage when it sees a flock of birds flying freely in the spacious sky Those valleys and hills fired myimagination but bitter thoughts wove round my heart a net of hopelessnessEvery time I went to the fields I returned disappointed without understanding the cause of my disappointment Every time I lookedat the gray sky I felt my heart contract Every time I heard the singing of the birds and babbling of the spring I suffered withoutunderstanding the reason for my suffering It is said that unsophistication makes a man empty and that emptiness makes himcarefree It may be true among those who were born dead and who exist like frozen corpses but the sensitive boy who feels muchand knows little is the most unfortunate creature under the sun because he is torn by two forces the first force elevates him andshows him the beauty of existence through a cloud of dreams the second ties him down to the earth and fills his eyes with dust andoverpowers him with fears and darknessSolitude has soft silky hands but with strong fingers it grasps the heart and makes it ache with sorrow Solitude is the ally of sorrowas well as a companion of spiritual exaltationThe boys soul undergoing the buffeting of sorrow is like a white lily just unfolding It trembles before the breeze and opens its heartto daybreak and folds its leaves back when the shadow of night comes If that boy does not have diversion or friends or companionsin his games his life will be like a narrow prison in which he sees nothing but spiderwebs and hears nothing but the crawling ofinsectsThat sorrow which obsessed me during my youth was not caused by lack of amusement because I could have had it neither fromlack of friends because I could have found them That sorrow was caused by an inward ailment which made me love solitude Itkilled in me the inclination for games and amusement It removed from my shoulders the wings of youth and made me like a pong ofwater between mountains which reflects in its calm surface the shadows of ghosts and the colors of clouds and trees but cannot findan outlet by which to pass singing to the seaThus was my life before I attained the age of eighteen That year is like a mountain peak in my life for it awakened knowledge in meand made me understand the vicissitudes of mankind In that year I was reborn and unless a person is born again his life will remainlike a blank sheet in the book of existence In that year I saw the angels of heaven looking at me through the eyes of a beautifulwoman I also saw the devils of hell raging in the heart of an evil man He who does not see the angels and devils in the beauty andmalice of life will be far removed from knowledge and his spirit will be empty of affection Return to the Top Return to the TopChapter 2  The Hand of DestinyIn the spring of the that wonderful year I was in Beirut The gardens were full of Nisan flowers and the earth was carpeted withgreen grass and like a secret of earth revealed to Heaven The orange trees and apple trees looking like houris or brides sent bynature to inspire poets and excite the imagination were wearing white garments of perfumed blossomsSpring is beautiful everywhere but it is most beautiful in Lebanon It is a spirit that roams round the earth but hovers over Lebanonconversing with kings and prophets singing with the rives the songs of Solomon and repeating with the Holy Cedars of Lebanon thememory of ancient glory Beirut free from the mud of winter and the dust of summer is like a bride in the spring or like a mermaidsitting by the side of a brook drying her smooth skin in the rays of the sunOne day in the month of Nisan I went to visit a friend whose home was at some distance from the glamorous city As we wereconversing a dignified man of about sixtyfive entered the house As I rose to greet him my friend introduced him to me as FarrisEffandi Karamy and then gave him my name with flattering words The old man looked at me a moment touching his forehead withthe ends of his fingers as if he were trying to regain his memory Then he smilingly approached me saying  You are the son of a verydear friend of mine and I am happy to see that friend in your personMuch affected by his words I was attracted to him like a bird whose instinct leads him to his nest before the coming of the tempestAs we sat down he told us about his friendship with my father recalling the time which they spent together An old man likes toreturn in memory to the days of his youth like a stranger who longs to go back to his own country He delights to tell stories of thepast like a poet who takes pleasure in reciting his best poem He lives spiritually in the past because the present passes swiftly and7192020 Broken Wings by Kahlil GibrannewthoughtlibrarycomgibranKhalilbrokenWings 320the future seems to him an approach to the oblivion of the grave An hour full of old memories passed like the shadows of the treesover the grass When Farris Effandi started to leave he put his left hand on my shoulder and shook my right hand saying  I havenot seen your father for twenty years I hope you will l take his place in frequent visits to my house I promised gratefully to do myduty toward a dear friend of my fatherWhen the old man left the house I asked my friend to tell me more about him He said I do not know any other man in Beirutwhose wealth has made him kind and whose kindness has made him wealthy He is one of the few who come to this world and leaveit without harming any one but people of that kind are usually miserable and oppressed because they are not clever enough to savethemselves from the crookedness of others Farris Effandi has one daughter whose character is similar to his and whose beauty andgracefulness are beyond description and she will also be miserable because her fathers wealth is placing her already at the edge of ahorrible precipiceAs he uttered these words I noticed that his face clouded Then he continued Farris Effandi is a good old man with a noble heartbut he lacks will power People lead him like a blind man His daughter obeys him in spite of her pride and intelligence and this isthe secret which lurks in the life of father and daughter This secret was discovered by an evil man who is a bishop and whosewickedness hides in the shadow of his Gospel He makes the people believe that he is kind and noble He is the head of religion inthis land of the religions The people obey and worship him He leads them like a flock of lambs to the slaughter house This bishophas a nephew who is full of hatefulness and corruption The day will come sooner or later when he will place his nephew on his rightand Farris Effandis daughter on this left and holding with his evil hand the wreath of matrimony over their heads will tie a purevirgin to a filthy degenerate placing the heart of the day in the bosom of the nightThat is all I can tell you about Farris Effandi and his daughter so do not ask me any more questionsSaying this he turned his head toward the window as if he were trying to solve the problems of human existence by concentrating onthe beauty of the universeAs I left the house I told my friend that I was going to visit Farris Effandi in a few days for the purpose of fulfilling my promise andfor the sake of the friendship which had joined him and my father He stared at me for a moment and I noticed a change in hisexpression as if my few simple words had revealed to him a new idea Then he looked straight through my eyes in a strange mannera look of love mercy and fear  the look of a prophet who foresees what no one else can divine Then his lips trembled a little but hesaid nothing when I started towards the door That strange look followed me the meaning of which I could not understand until Igrew up in the world of experience where hearts understand each other intuitively and where spirits are mature with knowledge Return to the Top Return to the TopChapter 3  Entrance to the ShrineIn a few days loneliness overcame me and I tired of the grim faces of books I hired a carriage and started for the house of FarrisEffandi As i reached the pine woods where people went for picnics the driver took a private way shaded with willow trees on eachside Passing through  we could see the beauty of the green grass the grapevines and the many colored flowers of Nisan justblossomingIn a few minutes the carriage stopped before a solitary house in the midst of a beautiful garden The scent of roses gardenia andjasmine filled the air As I dismounted and entered the spacious garden I saw Farris Effandi coming to meet me He ushered me intohis house with a hearty welcome and sat by me like a happy father when he sees his son showering me with questions on my lifefuture and education I answered him my voice full of ambition and zeal for I heard ringing in my ears the hymn of glory and I wassailing the calm sea of hopeful dreams Just then a beautiful young woman dressed in a gorgeous white silk gown appeared frombehind the velvet curtains of the door and walked toward me Farris Effandi and I rose from our seatsThis is my daughter Selma said the old man Then he introduced me to her saying Fate has brought back to me a dear old friendof mine in the person of his son Selma stared at me a moment as if doubting that a visitor could have entered their house Herhand when I touched it was like a white lily and a strange pang pierced my heartWe all sat silent as if Selma had brought into the room with her heavenly spirit worthy of mute respect As she felt the silence shesmiled at me and said Many a times my father has repeated to me the stories of his youth and of the old days he and your fatherspent together If your father spoke to you in the same way then this meeting is not the first one between usThe old man was delighted to hear his daughter talking in such a manner and said Selma is very sentimental She sees everythingthrough the eyes of the spirit Then he resumed his converstion with care and tact as if he had found in me a magic which took himon the wings of memory to the days of the pastAs I considered him dreaming of my own later years he looked upon me as a lofty old tree that has withstood storms and sunshinethrows its shadow upon a small sapling which shakes before the breeze of dawnBut Selma was silent Occasionally she looked first at me and then at her father as if reading the first and last chapters of lifesdrama The day passed faster in that garden and I could see through the window the ghostly yellow kiss of sunset on the mountains7192020 Broken Wings by Kahlil GibrannewthoughtlibrarycomgibranKhalilbrokenWings 420of Lebanon Farris Effandi continued to recount his experiences and I listened entranced and responded with such enthusiasm thathis sorrow was changed to happinessSelma sat by the window looking on with sorrowful eyes and not speaking although beauty has its own heavenly language loftierthan the voices of tongues and lips It is a timeless language common to all humanity a calm lake that attracts the singing rivulets toits depth and makes them silentOnly our spirits can understand beauty or live and grow with it It puzzles our minds we are unable to describe it in words it is asensation that our eyes cannot see derived from both the one who observes and the one who is looked upon Real beauty is a raywhich emanates from the holy of holies of the spirit and illuminates the body as life comes from the depths of the earth and givescolor and scent to a flowerReal beauty lies in the spiritual accord that is called love which can exist between a man and a womanDid my spirit and Selmas reach out to each other that day when we met and did that yearning make me see her as the mostbeautiful woman under the sun Or was I intoxicated with the wine of youth which made me fancy that which never existedDid my youth blind my natural eyes and make me imagine the brightness of her eyes the sweetness of her mouth and the grace ofher figure Or was it that her brightness sweetness and grace opened my eyes and showed me the happiness and sorrow of loveIt is hard to answer these questions but I say truly that in that hour I felt an emotion that I had never felt before a new affectionresting calmly in my heart like the spirit hovering over the waters at the creation of the world and from that affection was born myhappiness and my sorrow Thus ended the hour of my first meeting with Selma and thus the will of Heaven freed me from thebondage of youth and solitude and let me walk in the procession of loveLove is the only freedom in the world because it so elevates the spirit that the laws of humanity and the phenomena of nature do notalter its courseAs I rose from my seat to depart Farris Effandi came close to me and said soberly Now my son since you know your way to thishouse you should come often and feel that you are coming to your fathers house Consider me as a father and Selma as a sisterSaying this he turned to Selma as if to ask confirmation of his statement She nodded her head positively and then looked at me asone who has found an old acquaintanceThose words uttered by Farris Effandi Karamy placed me side by side with his daughter at the altar of love Those words were aheavenly song which started with exaltation and ended with sorrow they raised our spirits to the realm of light and searing flamethey were the cup from which we drank happiness and bitternessI left the house The old man accompanied me to the edge of the garden while my heart throbbed like the trembling lips of a thirstyman Return to the Top Return to the TopChapter 4  The White TorchThe month of Nisan had nearly passed I continued to visit the home of Farris Effendi and to meet Selma in that beautiful gardengazing upon her beauty marveling at her intelligence and hearing the stillness of sorrow I felt an invisible hand drawing me to herEvery visit gave me a new meaning to her beauty and a new insight into her sweet spirit Until she became a book whose pages Icould understand and whose praises I could sing but which I could never finish reading A woman whom Providence has providedwith beauty of spirit and body is a truth at the same time both open and secret which we can understand only by love and touchonly by virtue and when we attempt to describe such a woman she disappears like vaporSelma Karamy had bodily and spiritual beauty but how can I describe her to one who never knew her Can a dead man rememberthe singing of a nightingale and the fragrance of a rose and the sigh of a brook Can a prisoner who is heavily loaded with shacklesfollow the breeze of the dawn Is not silence more painful than death Does pride prevent me from describing Selma in plain wordssince I cannot draw her truthfully with luminous colors A hungry man in a desert will not refuse to eat dry bread if Heaven does notshower him with manna and quailsIn her white silk dress Selma was slender as a ray of moonlight coming through the window She walked gracefully and rhythmicallyHer voice was low and sweet words fell from her lips like drops of dew falling from the petals of flowers when they are disturbed bythe windBut Selmas face No words can describe its expression reflecting first great internal suffering then heavenly exaltationThe beauty of Selmas face was not classic it was like a dream of revelation which cannot be measured or bound or copied by thebrush of a painter or the chisel of a sculptor Selmas beauty was not in her golden hair but in the virtue of purity which surroundedit not in her large eyes but in the light which emanated from them not in her red lips but in the sweetness of her words not in herivory neck but in its slight bow to the front Nor was it in her perfect figure but in the nobility of her spirit burning like a white7192020 Broken Wings by Kahlil GibrannewthoughtlibrarycomgibranKhalilbrokenWings 520torch between earth and sky Her beauty was like a gift of poetry But poets care unhappy people for no matter how high theirspirits reach they will still be enclosed in an envelope of tearsSelma was deeply thoughtful rather than talkative and her silence was a kind of music that carried one to a world of dreams andmade him listen to the throbbing of his heart and see the ghosts of his thoughts and feelings standing before him looking him in theeyesShe wore a cloak of deep sorrow through her life which increased her strange beauty and dignity as a tree in blossom is more lovelywhen seen through the mist of dawnSorrow linked her spirit and mine as if each saw in the others face what the heart was feeling and heard the echo of a hidden voiceGod had made two bodies in one and separation could be nothing but agonyThe sorrowful spirit finds rest when united with a similar one They join affectionately as a stranger is cheered when he sees anotherstranger in a strange land Hearts that are united through the medium of sorrow will not be separated by the glory of happiness Lovethat is cleansed by tears will remain externally pure and beautiful  Return to the Top Return to the TopChapter 5  The TempestOne day Farris Effandi invited me to dinner at his home I accepted my spirit hungry for the divine bread which Heaven placed inthe hands of Selma the spiritual bread which makes our hearts hungrier the more we eat of it It was this bread which Kais theArabian poet Dante and Sappho tasted and which set their hearts afar the bread which the Goddess prepares with the sweetness ofkisses and the bitterness of tearsAs I reached the home of Farris Effandi I saw Selma sitting on a bench in the garden resting her head against a tree and looking likea bride in her white silk dress or like a sentinel guarding that placeSilently and reverently I approached and sat by her I could not talk so I resorted to silence the only language of the heart but I feltthat Selma was listening to my wordless call and watching the ghost of my soul in my eyesIn a few minutes the old man came out and greeted me as usual When he stretched his hand toward me I felt as if he were blessingthe secrets that united me and his daughter Then he said Dinner is ready my children let us eat We rose and followed him andSelmas eyes brightened for a new sentiment had been added to her love by her fathers calling us his childrenWe sat at the table enjoying the food and sipping the old wine but our souls were living in a world far away We were dreaming of thefuture and its hardshipsThree persons were separated in thoughts but united in love three innocent people with much feeling but little knowledge a dramawas being performed by an old man who loved his daughter and cared for her happiness a young woman of twenty looking into thefuture with anxiety and a young man dreaming and worrying who had tasted neither the wine of life nor its vinegar and trying toreach the height of love and knowledge but unable to life himself up We three sitting in twilight were eating and drinking in thatsolitary home guarded by Heavens eyes but at the bottoms of our glasses were hidden bitterness and anguishAs we finished eating one of the maids announced the presence of a man at the door who wished to see Farris Effandi Who is heasked the old man The Bishops messenger said the maid There was a moment of silence during which Farris Effandi stared at hisdaughter like a prophet who gazes at Heaven to divine its secret Then he said to the maid Let the man inAs the maid left a man dressed in oriental uniform and with big mustache curled at the ends entered and greeted the old mansaying His Grace the Bishop has sent me for you with his private carriage he wishes to discuss important business with you Theold mans face clouded and his smile disappeared After a moment of deep thought he came close to me and said in a friendly voiceI hope to find you here when I come back for Selma will enjoy your company in this solitary placeSaying this he turned to Selma and smiling asked if she agreed She nodded her head but her cheeks became red and with a voicesweeter than the music of the lyre she said I will do my best Father to make our guest happySelma watched the carriage that had taken her father and the Bishops messenger until it disappeared Then she came and satopposite me on a divan covered with green silk She looked like a lily bent to the carpet of green grass by the breeze of dawn It wasthe will of Heaven that I should be with Selma alone at night in her beautiful home surrounded by trees where silence love beautyand virtue dwelt togetherWe were both silent each waiting for the other to speak but speech is not the only means of understanding between two souls It isnot the syllables that come from the lips and tongues that bring hearts together7192020 Broken Wings by Kahlil GibrannewthoughtlibrarycomgibranKhalilbrokenWings 620There is something greater and purer than what the mouth utters Silence illuminates our souls whispers to our hearts and bringsthem together Silence separates us from ourselves makes us sail the firmament of spirit and brings us closer to Heaven it makes usfeel that bodies are no more than prisons and that this world is only a place of exileSelma looked at me and her eyes revealed the secret of her heart Then she quietly said Let us go to the garden and sit under thetrees and watch the moon come up behind the mountains Obediently I rose from my seat but I hesitatedDont you think we had better stay here until the moon has risen and illuminates the garden And I continued The darkness hidesthe trees and flowers We can see nothingThen she said If darkness hides the trees and flowers from our eyes it will not hide love from our heartsUttering these words in a strange tone she turned her eyes and looked through the window I remained silent pondering her wordsweighing the true meaning of each syllable Then she looked at me as if she regretted what she had said and tried to take away thosewords from my ears by the magic of her eyes But those eyes instead of making me forget what she had said repeated through thedepths of my heart more clearly and effectively the sweet words which had already become graven in my memory for eternityEvery beauty and greatness in this world is created by a single thought or emotion inside a man Every thing we see today made bypast generation was before its appearance a thought in the mind of a man or an impulse in the heart of a woman The revolutionsthat shed so much blood and turned mens minds toward liberty were the idea of one man who lived in the midst of thousands ofmen The devastating wars which destroyed empires were a thought that existed in the mind of an individual The supreme teachingsthat changed the course of humanity were the ideas of a man whose genius separated him from his environment A single thoughtbuild the Pyramids founded the glory of Islam and caused the burning of the library at AlexandriaOne thought will come to you at night which will elevate you to glory or lead you to asylum One look from a womans eye makes youthe happiest man in the world One word from a mans lips will make you rich or poorThat word which Selma uttered that night arrested me between my past and future as a boat which is anchored in the midst of theocean That word awakened me from the slumber of youth and solitude and set me on the stage where life and death play their partsThe scent of flowers mingled with the breeze as we came into the garden and sat silently on a bench near a jasmine tree listening tothe breathing of sleeping nature while in the blue sky the eyes of heaven witnessed our dramaThe moon came out from behind Mount Sannin and shone over the coast hills and mountains and we could see the villagesfringing the valley like apparitions which have suddenly been conjured from nothing We could see the beauty of Lebanon under thesilver rays of the moonPoets of the West think of Lebanon as a legendary place forgotten since the passing of David and Solomon and the Prophets as theGarden of Eden became lost after the fall of Adam and Eve To those Western poets the word Lebanon is a poetical expressionassociated with a mountain whose sides are drenched with the incense of the Holy Cedars It reminds them of the temples of copperand marble standing stern and impregnable and of a herd of deer feeding in the valleys That night I saw Lebanon dreamlike withthe eyes of a poetThus the appearance of things changes according to the emotions and thus we see magic and beauty in them while the magic andbeauty are really in ourselvesAs the rays of the moon shone on the face neck and arms of Selma she looked like a statue of ivory sculptured by the fingers ofsome worshiper of Ishtar goddess of beauty and love As she looked at me she said Why are you silent Why do you not tell mesomething about your past As I gazed at her my muteness vanished and I opened my lips and said Did you not hear what I saidwhen we came to this orchard The spirit that hears the whispering of flowers and the singing of silence can also hear the shriekingof my soul and the clamor of my heartShe covered her face with her hands and said in a trembling voice Yes I heard you  I heard a voice coming from the bosom ofnight and a clamor raging in the heart of the dayForgetting my past my very existence  everything but Selma  I answered her saying And I heard you too Selma I heardexhilarating music pulsing in the air and causing the whole universe to trembleUpon hearing these words she closed her eyes and her lips I saw a smile of pleasure mingled with sadness She whispered softlyNow I know that there is something higher than heaven and deeper than the ocean and stranger than life and death and time Iknow now what I did not know beforeAt that moment Selma became dearer than a friend and closer than a sister and more beloved than a sweetheart She became asupreme thought a beautiful an overpowering emotion living in my spiritIt is wrong to think that love comes from long companionship and persevering courtship Love is the offspring of spiritual affinityand unless that affinity is created in a moment it will not be created in years or even generationsThen Selma raised her head and gazed at the horizon where Mount Sannin meets the sky and said Yesterday you were like abrother to me with whom I lived and by whom I sat calmly under my fathers care Now I feel the presence of something strangerand sweeter than brotherly affection an unfamiliar commingling of love and fear that fills my heart with sorrow and happiness7192020 Broken Wings by Kahlil GibrannewthoughtlibrarycomgibranKhalilbrokenWings 720I responded This emotion which we fear and which shakes us when it passes through our hearts is the law of nature that guides themoon around the earth and the sun around the GodShe put her hand on my head and wove her fingers thought my hair Her face brightened and tears came out of her eyes like drops ofdew on the leaves of a lily and she said Who would believe our story  who would believe that in this hour we have surmounted theobstacles of doubt Who would believe that the month of Nisan which brought us together for the first time is the month that haltedus in the Holy of Holies of lifeHer hand was still on my head as she spoke and I would not have preferred a royal crown or a wreath of glory to that beautifulsmooth hand whose fingers were twined in my hairThen I answered her People will not believe our story because they do not know what love is the only flower that grows andblossoms without the aid of seasons but was it Nisan that brought us together for the first time and is it this hour that has arrestedus in the Holy of Holies of life Is it not the hand of God that brought our souls close together before birth and made us prisoners ofeach other for all the days and nights Mans life does not commence in the womb and never ends in the grave and this firmamentfull of moonlight and stars is not deserted by loving souls and intuitive spiritsAs she drew her hand away from my head I felt a kind of electrical vibration at the roots of my hair mingled with the night breezeLike a devoted worshiper who receives his blessing by kissing the altar in a shrine I took Selmas hand placed my burning lips on itand gave it a long kiss the memory of which melts my heart and awakens by its sweetness all the virtue of my spiritAn hour passed every minute of which was a year of love The silence of the night moonlight flowers and trees made us forget allreality except love when suddenly we heard the galloping of horses and rattling of carriage wheels Awakened from our pleasantswoon and plunged from the world of dreams into the world of perplexity and misery we found that the old man had returned fromhis mission We rose and walked through the orchard to meet himThen the carriage reached the entrance of the garden Farris Effandi dismounted and slowly walked towards us bending forwardslightly as if he were carrying a heavy load He approached Selma and placed both of his hands on her shoulders and stared at herTears coursed down his wrinkled cheeks and his lips trembled with sorrowful smile In a choking voice he said My beloved Selmavery soon you will be taken away from the arms of your father to the arms of another man Very soon fate will carry you from thislonely home to the worlds spacious court and this garden will miss the pressure of your footsteps and your father will become astranger to you All is done may God bless youHearing these words Selmas face clouded and her eyes froze as if she felt a premonition of death Then she screamed like a birdshot down suffering and trembling and in a choked voice said What do you say What do you mean Where are you sending meThen she looked at him searchingly trying to discover his secret In a moment she said I understand I understand everything TheBishop has demanded me from you and has prepared a cage for this bird with broken wings Is this your will FatherHis answer was a deep sigh Tenderly he led Selma into the house while I remained standing in the garden waves of perplexitybeating upon me like a tempest upon autumn leaves Then I followed them into the living room and to avoid embarrassment shookthe old mans hand looked at Selma my beautiful star and left the houseAs I reached the end of the garden I heard the old man calling me and turned to meet him Apologetically he took my hand and saidForgive me my son I have ruined your evening with the shedding of tears but please come to see me when my house is desertedand I am lonely and desperate Youth my dear son does not combine with senility as morning does not have meet the night butyou will come to me and call to my memory the youthful days which I spent with your father and you will tell me the news of lifewhich does not count me as among its sons any longer Will you not visit me when Selma leaves and I am left here in lonelinessWhile he said these sorrowful words and I silently shook his hand I felt the warm tears falling from his eyes upon my handTrembling with sorrow and filial affection I felt as if my heart were choked with grief When I raised my head and he saw the tears inmy eyes he bent toward me and touched my forehead with his lips Goodbye son GoodbyeAn old mans tear is more potent than that of a young man because it is the residuum of life in his weakening body A young manstear is like a drop of dew on the leaf of a rose while that of an old man is like a yellow leaf which falls with the wind at the approachof winterAs I left the house of Farris Effandi Karamy Selmas voice still rang in my ears her beauty followed me like a wraith and her fatherstears dried slowly on my handMy departure was like Adams exodus from Paradise but the Eve of my heart was not with me to make the whole world an EdenThat night in which I had been born again I felt that I saw deaths face for the first timeThus the sun enlivens and kills the fields with its heat  Return to the Top Return to the Top7192020 Broken Wings by Kahlil

privacy willbecome unexpectedly common conversation Deed which we hide today in the corners of our lodgings will be shouted on every streettomorrowThus the ghosts of darkness revealed the purpose of Bishop Bulos Galibs meeting with Farris Effandi Karamy and his conversationwas repeated all over the neighborhood until it reached my earsThe discussion that took place between Bishop Buols Galib and Farris Effandi that night was not over the problems of the poor or thewidows and orphans The main purpose for sending after Farris Effandi and bringing him in the Bishops private carriage was thebetrothal of Selma to the Bishops nephew Mansour Bey GalibSelma was the only child of the wealthy Farris Effandi and the Bishops choice fell on Selma not on account of her beauty and noblespirit but on account of her fathers money which would guarantee Mansour Bey a good and prosperous fortune and make him animportant manThe heads of religion in the East are not satisfied with their own munificence but they must strive to make all members of theirfamilies superiors and oppressors The glory of a prince goes to his eldest son by inheritance but the exaltation of a religious head iscontagious among his brothers and nephews Thus the Christian bishop and the Moslem imam and the Brahman priest become likesea reptiles who clutch their prey with many tentacles and suck their blood with numerous mouthsWhen the Bishop demanded Selmas hand for his nephew the only answer that he received from her father was a deep silence andfalling tears for he hated to lose his only child Any mans soul trembles when he is separated from his only daughter whom he hasreared to young womanhoodThe sorrow of parents at the marriage of a daughter is equal to their happiness at the marriage of a son because a son brings to thefamily a new member while a daughter upon her marriage is lost to themFarris Effandi perforce granted the Bishops request obeying his will unwillingly because Farris Effandi knew the Bishops nephewvery well knew that he was dangerous full of hate wickedness and corruptionIn Lebanon no Christian could oppose his bishop and remain in good standing No man could disobey his religious head and keephis reputation The eye could not resist a spear without being pierced and the hand could not grasp a sword without being cut offSuppose that Farris Effandi had resisted the Bishop and refused his wish then Selmas reputation would have been ruined and hername would have been blemished by the dirt of lips and tongues In the opinion of the fox high bunches of grapes that cant bereached are sourThus destiny seized Selma and led her like a humiliated slave in the procession of miserable oriental woman and thus fell that noblespirit into the trap after having flown freely on the white wings of love in a sky full of moonlight scented with the odor of flowersIn some countries the parents wealth is a source of misery for the children The wide strong box which the father and mothertogether have used for the safety of their wealth becomes a narrow dark prison for the souls of their heirs The Almighty Dinar whichthe people worship becomes a demon which punished the spirit and deadens the heart Selma Karamy was one of those who were thevictims of their parents wealth and bridegrooms cupidity Had it not been for her fathers wealth Selma would still be livinghappilyA week had passed The love of Selma was my sole entertainer singing songs of happiness for me at night and waking me at dawn toreveal the meaning of life and the secrets of nature It is a heavenly love that is free from jealousy rich and never harmful to thespirit It is deep affinity that bathes the soul in contentment a deep hunger for affection which when satisfied fills the soul withbounty a tenderness that creates hope without agitating the soul changing earth to paradise and life to a sweet and a beautifuldream In the morning when I walked in the fields I saw the token of Eternity in the awakening of nature and when I sat by theseashore I heard the waves singing the song of Eternity And when I walked in the streets I saw the beauty of life and the splendor ofhumanity in the appearance of passersby and movements of workersThose days passed like ghosts and disappeared like clouds and soon nothing was left for me but sorrowful memories The eye withwhich I used to look at the beauty of spring and the awakening of nature could see nothing but the fury of the tempest and themisery of winter The ears with which I formerly heard with delight the song of the waves could hear only the howling of the windand the wrath of the sea against the precipice The soul which had observed happily the tireless vigor of mankind and the glory of theuniverse was tortured by the knowledge of disappointment and failure Nothing was more beautiful than those days of love andnothing was more bitter than those horrible nights of sorrowWhen I could no longer resist the impulse i went on the weekend once more to Selmas home  the shrine which Beauty haderected and which Love had blessed in which the spirit could worship and the heart kneel humbly and pray When I entered thegarden I felt a power pulling me away from this world and placing me in a sphere supernaturally free from struggle and hardshipLike a mystic who receives a revelation of Heaven I saw myself amid the trees and flowers and as I approached the entrance of thehouse I beheld Selma sitting on the bench in the shadow of a jasmine tree where we both had sat the week before on that nightwhich Providence had chosen for the beginning of my happiness and sorrow7192020 Broken Wings by Kahlil GibrannewthoughtlibrarycomgibranKhalilbrokenWings 920She neither moved nor spoke as I approached her She seemed to have known intuitively that I was coming and when I sat by hershe gazed at me for a moment and sighed deeply then turned her head and looked at the sky And after a moment full of magicsilence she turned back toward me and tremblingly took my hand and said in a faint voice Look at me my friend study my faceand I read in it that which you want to know and which I can not recite Look at me my beloved look at me my brotherI gazed at her intently and saw that those eyes which a few days ago were smiling like lips and moving like the wings of a nightingaleeyes were already sunken and glazed with sorrow and pain Her face that had resembled the unfolding sunkissed leaves of a lily hadfaded and become colorless Her sweet lips were like two withering roses that autumn has left on their stems Her neck that hadbeen a column of ivory was bent forward as if it no longer could support the burden of grief in her headAll these changes I saw in Selmas face but to me they were like a passing cloud that covered the face of the moon and makes it morebeautiful A look which reveals inward stress adds more beauty to the face no matter how much tragedy and pain it bespeaks butthe face which in silence does not announce hidden mysteries is not beautiful regardless of the symmetry of its features The cupdoes not entice our lips unless the wines color is seen through the transparent crystalSelma on that evening was like a cup full of heavenly wine concocted of the bitterness and sweetness of life Unaware shesymbolized the oriental woman who never leaves her parents home until she puts upon her neck the heavy yoke of her husband whonever leaves her loving mothers arms until she must live as a slave enduring the harshness of her husbands motherI continued to look at Selma and listen to her depressed spirit and suffer with her until I felt that time has ceased and the universehad faded from existence I could see only her two large eyes staring fixedly at me and could feel only her cold trembling handholding mineI woke from my swoon hearing Selma saying quietly Come by beloved let us discuss the horrible future before it comes My fatherhas just left the house to see the man who is going to be my companion until death My father whom God chose for the purpose ofmy existence will meet the man whom the world has selected to be my master for the rest of my life In the heart of this city the oldman who accompanied me during my youth will meet the young man who will be my companion for the coming years Tonight thetwo families will set the marriage date What a strange and impressive hour Last week at this time under this jasmine tree Loveembraced my soul for the first time okay While Destiny was writing the first word of my lifes story at the Bishops mansion Nowwhile my father and my suitor are planning the day of marriage I see your spirit quivering around me as a thirsty bird flickers abovea spring of water guarded by a hungry serpent Oh how great this night is And how deep is its mysteryHearing these words I felt that dark ghost of complete despondency was seizing our love to choke it in its infancy and I answeredher That bird will remain flickering over that spring until thirst destroys him or falls into the grasp of a serpent and becomes itspreyShe responded No my beloved this nightingale should remain alive and sing until dark comes until spring passes until the end ofthe world and keep on singing eternally His voice should not be silenced because he brings life to my heart his wings should not bebroken because their motion removes the cloud from my heartThen I whispered Selma my beloved thirst will exhaust him and fear will kill himShe replied immediately with trembling lips The thirst of soul is sweeter than the wine of material things and the fear of spirit isdearer than the security of the body But listen my beloved listen carefully I am standing today at the door of a new life which Iknow nothing about I am like a blind man who feels his way so that he will not fall My fathers wealth has placed me in the slavemarket and this man has bought me I neither know nor love him but I shall learn to love him and I shall obey him serve him andmake him happy I shall give him all that a weak woman can give a strong manBut you my beloved are still in the prime of life You can walk freely upon lifes spacious path carpeted with flowers You are free totraverse the world making of your heart a torch to light your way You can think talk and act freely you can write your name on theface of life because you are a man you can live as a master because your fathers wealth will not place you in the slave market to bebought and sold you can marry the woman of your choice and before she lives in your home you can let her reside in your heart andcan exchange confidences without hindrancesSilence prevailed for a moment and Selma continued But is it now that Life will tear us apart so that you may attain the glory of aman and I the duty of a woman Is it for this that the valley swallows the song of the nightingale in its depths and the wind scattersthe petals of the rose and the feet tread upon the wind cup Were all those nights we spent in the moonlight by the jasmine treewhere our souls united in vain Did we fly swiftly toward the stars until our wings tired and are we descending now into the abyssOr was Love asleep when he came to us and did he when he woke become angry and decide to punish us Or did our spirits turnthe nights breeze into a wind that tore us to pieces and blew us like dust to the depth of the valley We disobeyed no commandmentnor did we taste of forbidden fruit so what is making us leave this paradise We never conspired or practiced mutiny then why arewe descending to hell No no the moments which united us are greater than centuries and the light that illuminated our spirits isstronger than the dark and if the tempest separates us on this rough ocean the waves will unite us on the calm shore and if this lifekills us death will unite us A womans heart will change with time or season even if it dies eternally it will never perish A womansheart is like a field turned into a battleground after the trees are uprooted and the grass is burned and the rocks are reddened withblood and the earth is planted with bones and skulls it is calm and silent as if nothing has happened for the spring and autumncome at their intervals and resume their workAnd now my beloved what shall we do How shall we part and when shall we meet Shall we consider love a strange visitor whocame in the evening and left us in the morning Or shall we suppose this affection a dream that came in our sleep and departed when7192020 Broken Wings by Kahlil GibrannewthoughtlibrarycomgibranKhalilbrokenWings 1020we awokeShall we consider this week an hour of intoxication to be replaced by soberness Raise your head and let me look at you my belovedopen your lips and let me hear your voice Speak to me Will you remember me after this tempest has sunk the ship of our love Willyou hear the whispering of my wings in the silence of the night Will you hear my spirit fluttering over you Will you listen to mysighs Will you see my shadow approach with the shadows of dusk and disappear with the flush of dawn Tell me my beloved whatwill you be after having been magic ray to my eyes sweet song to my ears and wings to my soul What will you beHearing these words my heart melted and I answered her  I will be as you want me to be my belovedThen she said  I want you to love me as a poet loves his sorrowful thoughts I want you to remember me as a traveler remembers acalm pool in which his image was reflected as he drank its water I want you to remember me as a mother remember her child thatdied before it saw the light and I want you to remember me as a merciful king remembers a prisoner who died before his pardonreached him I want you to be my companion and I want you to visit my father and console him in his solitude because I shall beleaving him soon and shall be a stranger to him I answered her saying  I will do all you have said and will make my soul anenvelope for your soul and my heart a residence for your beauty and my breast a grave for your sorrows I shall love you Selma asthe prairies love the spring and I shall live in you in the life of a flower under the suns rays I shall sing your name as the valley singsthe echo of the bells of the village churches I shall listen to the language of your soul as the shore listens to the story of the waves Ishall remember you as a stranger remembers his beloved country and as a hungry man remembers a banquet and as a dethronedking remembers the days of his glory and as a prisoner remembers the hours of ease and freedom I shall remember you as a sowerremembers the bundles of wheat on his threshing flour and as a shepherd remembers the green prairies the sweet brooksSelma listened to my words with palpitating heart and said Tomorrow the truth will become ghostly and the awakening will be likea dream Will a lover be satisfied embracing a ghost or will a thirsty man quench his thirst from the spring or a dreamI answered her Tomorrow destiny will put you in the midst of a peaceful family but it will send me into the world of struggle andwarfare You will be in the home of a person whom chance has made most fortunate through your beauty and virtue while I shall beliving a life of suffering and fear You will enter the gate of life while I shall enter the gate of death You will be received hospitablywhile I shall exist in solitude but I shall erect a statue of love and worship it in the valley of death Love will be my sole comforterand I shall drink love like wine and wear it like garment At dawn Love will wake me from slumber and take me to the distant fieldand at noon will lead me to the shadows of trees where I will find shelter with the birds from the heat of the sun In the evening itwill cause me to pause before sunset to hear natures farewell song to the light of day and will show me ghostly clouds sailing in thesky At night Love will embrace me and I shall sleep dreaming of the heavenly world where the spirits of lovers and poets abide Inthe Spring I shall walk side by side with love among violets and jasmines and drink the remaining drops of winter in the lily cups InSummer we shall make the bundles of hay our pillows and the grass our bed and the blue sky will cover us as we gaze at the starsand the moonIn Autumn Love and I will go to the vineyard and sit by the wine press and watch the grapevines being denuded of their goldenornaments and the migrating flocks of birds will wing over us In Winter we shall sit by the fireside reciting stories of long ago andchronicles of far countries During my youth Love will be my teacher in middle age my help and in old age my delight Love mybeloved Selma will stay with me to the end of my life and after death the hand of God will unite us againAll these words came from the depths of my heart like flames of fire which leap raging from the hearth and then disappear in theashes Selma was weeping as if her eyes were lips answering me with tearsThose whom love has not given wings cannot fly the cloud of appearances to see the magic world in which Selmas spirit and mineexisted together in that sorrowfully happy hour Those whom Love has not chosen as followers do not hear when Love calls Thisstory is not for them Even if they should comprehend these pages they would not be able to grasp the shadowy meanings which arenot clothed in words and do not reside on paper but what human being is he who has never sipped the wine from the cup of loveand what spirit is it that has never stood reverently before that lighted altar in the temple whose pavement is the hearts of men andwomen and whose ceiling is the secret canopy of dreams What flower is that on whose leaves the dawn has never poured a drop ofdew what streamlet is that which lost its course without going to the seaSelma raised her face toward the sky and gazed at the heavenly stars which studded the firmament She stretched out her hands hereyes widened and her lips trembled On her pale face I could see the signs of sorrow oppression hopelessness and pain Then shecried  Oh Lord what has a woman done that hath offended Thee What sin has she committed to deserve such a punishment Forwhat crime has she been awarded everlasting castigation Oh Lord Thou art strong and I am weak Why hast Thou made me sufferpain Thou art great and almighty while I am nothing but a tiny creature crawling before Thy throne Why hast Thou crushed mewith Thy foot Thou art a raging tempest and I am like dust why my Lord hast Thou flung me upon the cold earth Thou artpowerful and I am helpless why art Thou fighting me Thou art considerate and I am prudent why art Thou destroying me Thouhast created woman with love and why with love dost Thou ruin her With Thy right hand dost Thou lift her and with Thy lefthand dost Thou strike her into the abyss and she knows not why In her mouth Thou blowest the breath of Life and in her heartThou sowest the seeds of death Thou dost show her the path of happiness but Thou leadest her in the road of misery in her mouthThou dost place a song of happiness but then Thou dost close her lips with sorrow and dost fetter her tongue with agony With Thymysterious fingers dost Thou dress her wounds and with Thine hands Thou drawest the dread of pain round her pleasures In herbed Thou hidest pleasure and peace but beside it Thou dost erect obstacles and fear Thou dost excite her affection through Thy willand from her affection does shame emanate By Thy will Thou showest her the beauty of creation but her love for beauty becomes aterrible famine Thou dost make her drink life in the cup of death and death in the cup of life Thou purifiest her with tears and intears her life streams away Oh Lord Thou hast opened my eyes with love and with love Thou hast blinded me Thou hast kissed me7192020 Broken Wings by Kahlil GibrannewthoughtlibrarycomgibranKhalilbrokenWings 1120with Thy lips and struck me with Thy strong hand Thou has planted in my heart a white rose but around the rose a barrier ofthorns Thou hast tied my present with the spirit of a young man whom I love but my life with the body of an unknown man So helpme my Lord to be strong in this deadly struggle and assist me to be truthful and virtuous until death Thy will be done Oh  LordGodSilence continued Selma looked down pale and frail her arms dropped and her head bowed and it seemed to me as if a tempesthad broken a branch from a tree and cast it down to dry and perishI took her cold hand and kissed it but when I attempted to console her it was I who needed consolation more than she did I keptsilent thinking of our plight and listening to my heartbeats Neither of us said moreExtreme torture is mute and so we sat silent petrified like columns of marble buried under the sand of an earthquake Neitherwished to listen to the other because our heartthreads had become weak and even breathing would have broken themIt was midnight and we could see the crescent moon rising from behind Mount Sannin and it looked in the midst of the stars likethe face of a corpse in a coffin surrounded by the dim lights of candles And Lebanon looked like an old man whose back was bentwith age and whose eyes were a haven for insomnia watching the dark and waiting for dawn like asking sitting on the ashes of histhrone in the debris of his palaceThe mountains trees and rivers change their appearance with the vicissitudes of times and seasons as a man changes with hisexperiences and emotions The lofty poplar that resembles a bride in the daytime will look like a column of smoke in the eveningthe huge rock that stands impregnable at noon will appear to be a miserable pauper at night with earth for his bed and the sky forhis cover and the rivulet that we see glittering in the morning and hear singing the hymn of Eternity will in the evening turn to astream of tears wailing like a mother bereft of her child and Lebanon that had looked dignified a week before when the moon wasfull and our spirits were happy looked sorrowful and lonesome that nightHe stood up and bade each other farewell but love and despair stood between us like two ghosts one stretching his wings with hisfingers over our throats one weeping and the other laughing hideouslyAs I took Selmas hand and put it to my lips she came close to me and placed a kiss on my forehead then dropped on the woodenbench She shut her eyes and whispered softly Oh Lord God have mercy on me and mend my broken wingsAs I left Selma in the garden I felt as if my senses were covered with a thick veil like a lake whose surface is concealed by fogThe beauty of trees the moonlight the deep silence everything about me looked ugly and horrible The true light that had showedme the beauty and wonder of the universe was converted to a great flame of fire that seared my heart and the Eternal music I used tohear became a clamor more frightening than the roar of a lionI reached my room and like a wounded bird shot down by a hunter I fell on my bed repeating the words of Selma Oh Lord Godhave mercy on me and mend my broken wingsReturn to the Top Return to the TopChapter 7  Before the Throne of DeathMarriage in these days is a mockery whose management is in the hands of young men and parents In most countries the young menwin while the parents lose The woman is looked upon as a commodity purchased and delivered from one house to another In timeher beauty fades and she becomes like an old piece of furniture left in a dark cornerModern civilization has made woman a little wiser but it has increased her suffering because of mans covetousness The woman ofyesterday was a happy wife but the woman of today is a miserable mistress In the past she walked blindly in the light but now shewalks openeyed in the dark She was beautiful in her ignorance virtuous in her simplicity and strong in her weakness Today shehas become ugly in her ingenuity superficial and heartless in her knowledge Will the day ever come when beauty and knowledgeingenuity and virtue and weakness of body and strength of spirit will be united in a womanI am one of those who believe that spiritual progress is a rule of human life but the approach to perfection is slow and painful If awoman elevates herself in one respect and is retarded in another it is because the rough trail that leads to the mountain peak is notfree of ambushes of thieves and lairs of wolvesThis strange generation exists between sleeping and waking It holds in its hands the soil of the past and the seeds of the futureHowever we find in every city a woman who symbolizes the futureIn the city of Beirut Selma Karamy was the symbol of the future Oriental woman but like many who lie ahead of their time shebecame the victim of the present and like a flower snatched from its stem and carried away by the current of a river she walked inthe miserable procession of the defeated7192020 Broken Wings by Kahlil GibrannewthoughtlibrarycomgibranKhalilbrokenWings 1220Mansour Bey Galib and Selma were married and lived together in a beautiful house at Ras Beyrouth where all the wealthydignitaries resided Farris Effandi Karamy was left in his solitary home in the midst of his garden and orchards like a lonely shepherdamid his flockThe days and merry nights of the wedding passed but the honeymoon left memories of times of bitter sorrow as wars leave skullsand dead bones on the battlefield The dignity of an Oriental wedding inspires the hearts of young men and women but itstermination may drop them like millstones to the bottom of the sea Their exhilaration is like footprints on sand which remain onlytill they are washed away by the wavesSpring departed and so did summer and autumn but my love for Selma increased day by day until it became a kind of muteworship the feeling that an orphan has toward the soul of his mother in Heaven My yearning was converted to blind sorrow thatcould see nothing but itself and the passion that drew tears from my eyes was replaced by perplexity that sucked the blood from myheart and my sighs of affection became a constant prayer for the happiness of Selma and her husband and peace for her fatherMy hopes and prayers were in vain because Selmas misery was an internal malady that nothing but death could cureMansour Bey was a man to whom all the luxuries of life came easily but in spite of that he was dissatisfied and rapacious Aftermarrying Selma he neglected her father in his loneliness and prayed for his death so that he could inherit what was left of the oldmans wealthMansour Beys character was similar to his uncles the only difference between the two was that the Bishop got everything he wantedsecretly under the protection of his ecclesiastical robe and the golden cross which he wore on his chest while his nephew dideverything publicly The Bishop went to church in the morning and spent the rest of the day pilfering from the widows orphans andsimple minded people But Mansour Bey spent his days in pursuit of sexual satisfaction On Sunday Bishop Bulos Galib preached hisGospel but during weekdays he never practiced what he preached occupying himself with political intrigues of the locality And bymeans of his uncles prestige and influence Mansour Bey made it his business to secure political plums for those who could offer asufficient bribeBishop Bulos was a thief who hid himself under the cover of night while his nephew Mansour Bey was a swindler who walkedproudly in daylight However the people of Oriental nations place trust in such as theywolves and butchers who ruin their countrythrough covetousness and crush their neighbors with an iron handWhy do I occupy these pages with words about the betrayers of poor nations instead of reserving all the space for the story of amiserable woman with a broken heart Why do I shed tears for oppressed peoples rather than keep all my tears for the memory of aweak woman whose life was snatched by the teeth of deathBut my dear readers dont you think that such a woman is like a nation that is oppressed by priests and rulers Dont you believethat thwarted love which leads a woman to the grave is like the despair which pervades the people of the earth A woman is to anation as light is to a lamp Will not the light be dim if the oil in the lamp is lowAutumn passed and the wind blew the yellow leaves form the trees making way for winter which came howling and crying I wasstill in the City of Beirut without a companion save my dreams which would lift my spirit to the sky and then bury it deep in thebosom of the earthThe sorrowful spirit finds relaxation in solitude It abhors people as a wounded deer deserts the herd and lives in a cave until it ishealed or deadOne day I heard Farris Effandi was ill I left my solitary abode and walked to his home taking a new route a lonely path betweenolive trees avoiding the main road with its rattling carriage wheelsArriving at the old mans house I entered and found Farris Effandi lying on his bed weak and pale His eyes were sunken and lookedlike two deep dark valleys haunted by the ghosts of pain The smile which had always enlivened his face was choked with pain andagony and the bones of his gentle hands looked like naked branches trembling before the tempest As I approached him andinquired as to his health he turned his pale face toward me and on his trembling lips appeared a smile and he said in a weak voiceGo  go my son to the other room and comfort Selma and bring her to sit by the side of my bedI entered the adjacent room and found Selma lying on a divan covering her head with her arms and burying her face in a pillow sothat her father would not hear her weeping Approaching slowly I pronounced her name in a voice that seemed more like sighingthan whispering She moved fearfully as if she had been interrupted in a terrible dream and sat up looking at me with glazed eyesdoubting whether I was a ghost or a living being After a deep silence which took us back on the wings of memory to that hour whenwe were intoxicated with wine of love Selma wiped away her tears and said See how time has changed us See how time haschanged the course of our lives and left us in these ruins In this place spring united us in a bond of love and in this place hasbrought us together before the throne of death How beautiful was spring and how terrible is this winterSpeaking thus she covered her face again with her hands as if she were shielding her eyes from the specter of the past standingbefore her I put my hand on her head and said Come Selma come and let us be as strong towers before the tempest Let us standlike brave soldiers before the enemy and face his weapons If we are killed we shall die as martyrs and if we win we shall live asheroes Braving obstacles and hardships is nobler than retreat to tranquility The butterfly that hovers around the lamp until it dies ismore admirable than the mole that lives in a dark tunnel Come Selma let us walk this rough path firmly with our eyes toward thesun so that we may not see the skulls and serpents among the rocks and thorns If fear should stop us in middle of the road we7192020 Broken Wings by Kahlil GibrannewthoughtlibrarycomgibranKhalilbrokenWings 1320would hear only ridicule from the voices of the night but if we reach the mountain peak bravely we shall join the heavenly spirits insongs of triumph and joy Cheer up Selma wipe away your tears and remove the sorrow from your face Rise and let us sit by thebed of your father because his life depends on your life and your smile is his only cureKindly and affectionately she looked at me and said Are you asking me to have patience while you are in need of it yourself Will ahungry man give his bread to another hungry man Or will sick man give medicine to another which he himself needs badlyShe rose her head bent slightly forward and we walked to the old mans room and sat by the side of his bed Selma forced a smile andpretended to be patient and her father tried to make her believe that he was feeling better and getting stronger but both father anddaughter were aware of each others sorrow and heard the unvoiced sighs They were like two equal forces wearing each other awaysilently The fathers heart was melting because of his daughters plight They were two pure souls one departing and the otheragonized with grief embracing in love and death and I was between the two with my own troubled heart We were three peoplegathered and crushed by the hands of destiny an old man like a dwelling ruined by flood a young woman whose symbol was a lilybeheaded by the sharp edge of a sickle and a young man who was a weak sapling bent by a snowfall and all of us were toys in thehands of fateFarris Effandi moved slowly and stretched his weak hand toward Selma and in a loving and tender voice said Hold my hand mybeloved Selma held his hand then he said I have lived long enough and I have enjoyed the fruits of lifes seasons I haveexperienced all its phases with equanimity I lost your mother when you were three years of age and she left you as a precioustreasure in my lap I watched you grow and your face reproduced your mothers features as stars reflected in a calm pool of waterYour character intelligence and beauty are your mothers even your manner of speaking and gestures You have been my onlyconsolation in this life because you were the image of your mother in every deed and word Now I grow old and my only restingplace is between the soft wings of death Be comforted my beloved daughter because I have lived long enough to see you as awoman Be happy because I shall live in you after my death My departure today would be no different from my going tomorrow orthe day after for our days are perishing like the leaves of autumn The hour of my days are perishing like the leaves of autumn Thehour of my death approaches rapidly and my soul is desirous of being united with your mothersAs he uttered these words sweetly and lovingly his face was radiant Then he put his hand under his pillow and pulled out a smallpicture in a gold frame With his eyes on the little photograph he said Come Selma come and see your mother in this pictureSelma wiped away her tears and after gazing long at the picture she kissed it repeatedly and cried Oh my beloved mother Ohmother Then she placed her trembling lips on the picture as if she wished to pour her soul into that imageThe most beautiful word on the lips of mankind is the word Mother and the most beautiful call is the call of My mother it is aword full of hope and love a sweet and kind word coming from the depths of the heart The mother is every thing  she is ourconsolation in sorrow our hope in misery and our strength in weakness She is the source of love mercy sympathy and forgivenessHe who loses his mother loses a pure soul who blesses and guards him constantlyEvery thing in nature bespeaks the mother The sun is the mother of earth and gives it its nourishment of hear it never leaves theuniverse at night until it has put the earth to sleep to the song of the sea and the hymn of birds and brooks And this earth is themother of trees and flowers It produces them nurses them and weans them The trees and flowers become kind mothers of theirgreat fruits and seeds And the mother the prototype of all existence is the eternal spirit full of beauty and loveSelma Karamy never knew her mother because she had died when Selma was an infant but Selma wept when she saw the pictureand cried Oh mother The word mother is hidden in our hearts and it comes upon our lips in hours of sorrow and happiness asthe perfume comes from the heart of the rose and mingles with clear and cloudy airSelma stared at her mothers picture kissing it repeatedly until she collapsed by her fathers bedThe old man placed both hands on her head and said I have shown you my dear child a picture of your mother on paper Nowlisten to me and I shall let you hear her wordsShe lifted her head like a little bird in the nest that hears its mothers wing and looked at him attentivelyFarris Effandi opened his mouth and said Your mother was nursing you when she lost her father she cried and wept at his goingbut she was wise and patient She sat by me in this room as soon as the funeral was over and held my hand and said Farris myfather is dead now and you are my only consolation in this world The hearts affections are divided like the branches of the cedartree if the tree loses one strong branch it will suffer but it does not die It will pour all its vitality into the next branch so that it willgrow and fill the empty place This is what your mother told me when her father died and you should say the same thing when deathtakes my body to its resting place and my soul to Gods careSelma answered him with falling tears and broken heart When Mother lost her father you took his place but who is going to takeyours when you are gone She was left in the care of a loving and truthful husband she found consolation in her little daughter andwho will be my consolation when you pass away You have been my father and mother and the companion of my youthSaying these words she turned and looked at me and holding the side of my garment said This is the only friend I shall have afteryou are gone but how can he console me when he is suffering also How can a broken heart find consolation in a disappointed soulA sorrowful woman cannot be comforted by her neighbors sorrow nor can a bird fly with broken wings He is the friend of my soulbut I have already placed a heavy burden of sorrow upon him and dimmed his eyes with my tears till he can see nothing but7192020 Broken Wings by Kahlil GibrannewthoughtlibrarycomgibranKhalilbrokenWings 1420darkness He is a brother whom I dearly love but he is like all brothers who share my sorrow and help me shed tears which increasemy bitterness and burn my heartSelmas words stabbed my heart and I felt that I could bear no more The old man listened to her with depressed spirit The old manlistened to her with depressed spirit trembling like the light of a lamp before the wind Then he stretched out his hand and said Letme go peacefully my child I have broken the bars of this cage let me fly and do not stop me for your mother is calling me The skyis clear and the sea is calm and the boat is ready to sail do not delay its voyage Let my body rest with those who are resting let mydream end and my soul awaken with the dawn let your soul embrace mine and give me the kiss of hope let no drops of sorrow orbitterness fall upon my body lest the flowers and grass refuse their nourishment Do not shed tears of misery upon my hand for theymay grow thorns upon my grave Do not draw lines of agony upon my forehead for the wind may pass and read them and refuse tocarry the dust of my bones to the green prairies I love you my child while I lived and I shall love you when I am dead and my soulshall always watch over you and protect youThen Farris Effandi looked at me with his eyes half closed and said My son be a real brother to Selma as your father was to me Beher help and friend in need and do not let her mourn because mourning for the dead is a mistake Repeat to her pleasant tales andsing for her the songs of life so that she may forget her sorrows Remember me to your father ask him to tell you the stories of youryouth and tell him that I loved him in the person of his son in the last hour of my lifeSilence prevailed and I could see the pallor of death on the old mans face Then he rolled his eyes and looked at us and whisperedDont call the physician for he might extend my sentence in this prison by his medicine The days of slavery are gone and my soulseeks the freedom of the skies And do not call the priest to my bedside because his incantations would not save me if I were asinner nor would it rush me to Heaven if I were innocent The will of humanity cannot change the will of God as an astrologercannot change the course of the stars But after my death let the doctors and priest do what they please for my ship will continuesailing until it reaches its destination At midnight Farris Effandi opened his tired eyes for the last time and focused them on Selma who was kneeling by his bedside Hetried to speak but could not for death had already choked his voice but he finally managed to say The night has passed OhSelmaOhOh Selma Then he bent his head his face turned white and I could see a smile on his lips as he breathed his lastSelma felt her fathers hand It was cold Then she raised her head and looked at his face It was covered with the veil of death Selmawas so choked that she could not shed tears nor sigh nor even move For a moment she stared at him with fixed eyes like those of astatue then she bent down until her forehead touched the floor and said Oh Lord have mercy and mend our broken wingsFarris Effandi Karamy died his soul was embraced by Eternity and his body was returned to the earth Mansour Bey Galib gotpossession of his wealth and Selma became a prisoner of lifea life of grief and miseryI was lost in sorrow and reverie Days and nights preyed upon me as the eagle ravages its victim Many a time I tried to forget mymisfortune by occupying myself with books and scriptures of past generation but it was like extinguishing fire with oil for I couldsee nothing in the procession of the past but tragedy and could hear nothing but weeping and wailing The Book of Job was morefascinating to me than the Psalms and I preferred the Elegies of Jeremiah to the Song of Solomon Hamlet was closer to my heartthan all other dramas of western writers Thus despair weakens our sight and closes our ears We can see nothing but specters ofdoom and can hear only the beating of our agitated hearts Return to the Top Return to the TopChapter 8  Between Christ and IshtarIn the midst of the gardens and hills which connect the city of Beirut with Lebanon there is a small temple very ancient dug out ofwhite rock surrounded by olive almond and willow trees Although this temple is a half mile from the main highway at the time ofmy story very few people interested in relics and ancient ruins had visited it It was one of many interesting places hidden andforgotten in Lebanon Due to its seclusion it had become a haven for worshippers and a shrine for lonely loversAs one enters this temple he sees on the wall at the east side an old Phoenician picture carved in the rock depicting Ishtar goddessof love and beauty sitting on her throne surrounded by seven nude virgins standing in different posses The first one carries a torchthe second a guitar the third a censer the fourth a jug of wine the fifth a branch of roses the sixth a wreath of laurel the seventha bow and arrow and all of them look at Ishtar reverentlyOn the second wall there is another picture more modern than the first one symbolizing Christ nailed to the cross and at His sidestand His sorrowful mother and Mary Magdalene and two other women weeping This Byzantine picture shows that it was carved inthe fifteenth or sixteenth centuryOn the west side wall there are two round transits through which the suns rays enter the temple and strike the pictures and makethem look as if they were painted with gold water color In the middle of the temple there is a square marble with old paintings on its7192020 Broken Wings by Kahlil GibrannewthoughtlibrarycomgibranKhalilbrokenWings 1520sides some of which can hardly be seen under the petrified lumps of blood which show that the ancient people offered sacrifices onthis rock and poured perfume wine and oil upon itThere is nothing else in that little temple except deep silence revealing to the living the secrets of the goddess and speakingworldlessly of past generations and the evolution of religions Such a sight carries the poet to a world far away from the one in whichhe dwells and convinces the philosopher that men were born religious they felt a need for that which they could not see and drewsymbols the meaning of which divulged their hidden secrets and their desires in life and death In that unknown temple I met Selma once every month and spent the hours with her looking at those strange pictures thinking ofthe crucified Christ and pondering upon the young Phoenician men and women who lived loved and worshipped beauty in theperson of Ishtar by burning incense before her statue and pouring perfume on her shrine people for whom nothing is left to speakexcept the name repeated by the march of time before the face of EternityIt is hard to write down in words the memories of those hours when I met Selma  those heavenly hours filled with pain happinesssorrow hope and miseryWe met secretly in the old temple remembering the old days discussing our present fearing our future and gradually bringing outthe hidden secrets in the depths of our hearts and complaining to each other of our misery and suffering trying to console ourselveswith imaginary hopes and sorrowful dreams Every now and then we would become calm and wipe our tears and start smilingforgetting everything except Love we embraced each other until our hearts melted then Selma would print a pure kiss on myforehead and fill my heart with ecstasy I would return the kiss as she bent her ivory neck while her cheeks became gently red like thefirst ray of dawn on the forehead of hills We silently looked at the distant horizon where the clouds were colored with the orange rayof sunsetOur conversation was not limited to love every now and then we drifted on to current topics and exchanged ideas During the courseof conversation Selma spoke of womans place in society the imprint that the past generation had left on her character therelationship between husband and wife and the spiritual diseases and corruption which threatened married life I remember hersaying The poets and writers are trying to understand the reality of woman but up to this day they have not understood the hiddensecrets of her heart because they look upon her from behind the sexual veil and see nothing but externals they look upon herthrough the magnifying glass of hatefulness and find nothing except weakness and submissionOn another occasion she said pointing to the carved pictures on the walls of the temple In the heart of this rock there are twosymbols depicting the essence of a womans desires and revealing the hidden secrets of her soul moving between love and sorrow between affection and sacrifice between Ishtar sitting on the throne and Mary standing by the cross The man buys glory andreputation but the woman pays the priceNo one knew about our secret meetings except God and the flock of birds which flew over the temple Selma used to come in hercarriage to a place named Pasha park and from there she walked to the temple where she found me anxiously waiting for herWe feared not the observers eyes neither did our consciences bother us the spirit which is purified by fire and washed by tears ishigher than what the people call shame and disgrace it is free from the laws of slavery and old customs against the affections of thehuman heart That spirit can proudly stand unashamed before the throne of GodHuman society has yielded for seventy centuries to corrupted laws until it cannot understand the meaning of the superior andeternal laws A mans eyes have become accustomed to the dim light of candles and cannot see the sunlight Spiritual disease isinherited from one generation to another until it has become a part of people who look upon it not as a disease but as a natural giftshowered by God upon Adam If those people found someone free from the germs of this disease they would think of him withshame and disgraceThose who think evil of Selma Karamy because she left her husbands home and met me in the temple are the diseased and weakminded kind who look upon the healthy and sound as rebels They are like insects crawling in the dark for fear of being stepped uponby the passerbyThe oppressed prisoner who can break away from his jail and does not do so is a coward Selma an innocent and oppressedprisoner was unable to free herself from slavery Was she to blame because she looked through the jail window upon the green fieldsand spacious sky Will the people count her as being untruthful to her husband because she came from his home to sit by mebetween Christ and Ishtar Let the people say what they please Selma had passed the marshes which submerge other spirits and hadlanded in a world that could not be reached by the howling of wolves and rattling of snakes People may say what they want aboutme for the spirit who has seen the specter of death cannot be scared by the faces of thieves the soldier who has seen the swordsglittering over his head and streams of blood under his feet does not care about rocks thrown at him by the children on the streetsReturn to the Top Return to the TopChapter 9  Sacrifice7192020 Broken Wings by Kahlil GibrannewthoughtlibrarycomgibranKhalilbrokenWings 1620One day in the late part of June as the people left the city for the mountain to avoid the heat of summer I went as usual to thetemple to meet Selma carrying with me a little book of Andalusian poems As I reached the temple I sat there waiting for Selmaglancing at intervals at the pages of my book reciting those verses which filled my heart with ecstasy and brought to my soul thememory of the kings poets and knights who bade farewell to Granada and left with tears in their eyes and sorrow in their heartstheir palaces institutions and hopes behind In an hour I saw Selma walking in the midst of the gardens and I approaching thetemple leaning on her parasol as if she were carrying all the worries of the world upon her shoulders As she entered the temple andsat by me I noticed some sort of change in her eyes and I was anxious to inquire about itSelma felt what was going on in my mind and she put her hand on my head and said Come close to me come my beloved comeand let me quench my thirst for the hour of separation has comeI asked her Did your husband find out about our meeting her She responded My husband does not care about me neither doeshe know how I spend my time for he is busy with those poor girls whom poverty has driven into the houses of ill fame those girlswho sell their bodies for bread kneaded with blood and tearsI inquired What prevents you from coming to this temple and sitting by me reverently before God Is your soul requesting ourseparationShe answered with tears in her eyes No my beloved my spirit did not ask for separation for you are a part of me My eyes never gettired of looking at you for you are their light but if destiny ruled that I should walk the rough path of life loaded with shackleswould I be satisfied if your fate should be like mine Then she added I cannot say everything because the tongue is mute with painand cannot talk the lips are sealed with misery and cannot move all I can say to you is that I am afraid you may fall in the same trapI fell inWhen I asked What do you mean Selma and of whom are you afraid She covered her face with her hands and said The Bishophas already found out that once a month I have been leaving the grave which he buried me inI inquired Did the Bishop find out about our meetings here She answered If he did you would not see me here sitting by youbut he is getting suspicious and he informed all his servants and guards to watch me closely I am feeling that the house I live in andthe path I walk on are all eyes watching me and fingers pointing at me and ears listening to the whisper of my thoughtsShe was silent for a while and then she added with tears pouring down her cheeks I am not afraid of the Bishop for wetness doesnot scare the drowned but I am afraid you might fall into the trap and become his prey you are still young and free as the sunlight Iam not frightened of fate which has shot all its arrows in my breast but I am afraid the serpent might bite your feet and detain youfrom climbing the mountain peak where the future awaits you with its pleasure and gloryI said He who has not been bitten by the serpents of light and snapped at by the wolves of darkness will always be deceived by thedays and nights But listen Selma listen carefully is separation the only means of avoiding peoples evils and meanness Has thepath of love and freedom been closed and is nothing left except submission to the will of the slaves of deathShe responded Nothing is left save separation and bidding each other farewellWith rebellious spirit I took her hand and said excitedly We have yielded to the peoples will for a long time since the time we metuntil this hour we have been led by the blind and have worshipped with them before their idols Since the time I met you we havebeen in the hands of the Bishop like two balls which he has thrown around as he pleased Are we going to submit to his will untildeath takes us away Did God give us the breath of life to place it under deaths feet Did He give us liberty to make it a shadow ofslavery He who extinguishes his spirits fire with his own hands is an infidel in the eyes of Heaven for Heaven set the fire that burnsin our spirits He who does not rebel against oppression is doing himself injustice I love you Selma and you love me too and Loveis a precious treasure it is Gods gift to sensitive and great spirits Shall we throw this treasure away and let the pigs scatter it andtrample on it This world is full of wonder and beauty Why are we living in this narrow tunnel which the Bishop and his assistantshave dug out for us Life is full of happiness and freedom why dont we take this heavy yoke off our shoulders and break the chainstied to our feet and walk freely toward peace Get up and let us leave this small temple for Gods great temple Let us leave thiscountry and all its slavery and ignorance for another country far away and unreached by the hands of the thieves Let us go to thecoast under the cover of night and catch a boat that will take us across the oceans where we can find a new life full of happiness andunderstanding Do not hesitate Selma for these minutes are more precious to us than the crowns of kings and more sublime than thethrones of angels Let us follow the column of light that leads us from this arid desert into the green fields where flowers andaromatic plants growShe shook her head and gazed at something invisible on the ceiling of the temple a sorrowful smile appeared on her lips then shesaid No no my beloved Heaven placed in my hand a cup full of vinegar and gall I forced myself to drink it in order to know thefull bitterness at the bottom until nothing was left save a few drops which I shall drink patiently I am not worthy of a new life of loveand peace I am not strong enough for lifes pleasure and sweetness because a bird with broken wings cannot fly in the spacious skyThe eyes that are accustomed to the dim light of a candle are not strong enough to stare at the sun Do not talk to me of happiness itsmemory makes me suffer Mention not peace to me its shadow frightens me but look at me and I will show you the holy torch whichHeaven has lighted in the ashes of my heart  you know that I love you as a mother loves her only child and Love only taught me toprotect you even from myself It is Love purified with fire that stops me from following you to the farthest land Love kills mydesires so that you may live freely and virtuously Limited love asks for possession of the beloved but the unlimited asks only foritself Love that comes between the naivete and awakening of youth satisfies itself with possessing and grows with embraces ButLove which is born in the firmaments lap and has descended with the nights secrets is not contended with anything but Eternity andimmortality it does not stand reverently before anything except deity7192020 Broken Wings by Kahlil GibrannewthoughtlibrarycomgibranKhalilbrokenWings 1720When I knew that the Bishop wanted to stop me from leaving his nephews house and to take my only pleasure away from me Istood before the window of my room and looked toward the sea thinking of the vast countries beyond it and the real freedom andpersonal independence which can be found there I felt that I was living close to you surrounded by the shadow of your spiritsubmerged in the ocean of your affection But all these thoughts which illuminate a womans heart and make her rebel against oldcustoms and live in the shadow of freedom and justice made me believe that I am weak and that our love is limited and feebleunable to stand before the suns face I cried like a king whose kingdom and treasure have been usurped but immediately I saw yourface through my tears and your eyes gazing at me and I remembered what you said to me once Come Selma come and let us bestrong towers before the tempest Let us stand like brave soldiers before the enemy and face his weapons If we are killed we shalldie as martyrs and if we win we shall live as heroes Braving obstacles and hardships is nobler than retreat to tranquility Thesewords my beloved you uttered when the wings of death were hovering around my fathers bed I remembered them yesterday whenthe wings of despair were hovering above my head I strengthened myself and felt while in the darkness of my prison some sort ofprecious freedom easing our difficulties and diminishing our sorrows I found out that our love was as deep as the ocean and as highas the stars and as spacious as the sky I came here to see you and in my weak spirit there is a new strength and this strength is theability to sacrifice a great thing in order to obtain a greater one it is the sacrifice of my happiness so that you may remain virtuousand honorable in the eyes of the people and be far away from their treachery and persecutionIn the past when I came to this place I felt as if heavy chains were pulling down on me but today I came here with a newdetermination that laughs at the shackles and shortens the way I used to come to this temple like a scared phantom but today Icame like a brave woman who feels the urgency of sacrifice and knows the value of suffering a woman who likes to protect the oneshe loves from the ignorant people and from her hungry spirit I used to sit by you like a trembling shadow but today I came here toshow you my true self before Ishtar and ChristI am a tree grown in the shade and today I stretched my branches to tremble for a while in the daylight I came here to tell yougoodbye my beloved and it is my hope that our farewell will be great and awful like our love Let our farewell be like fire that bendsthe gold and makes it more resplendentSelma did not allow me to speak or protest but she looked at me her eyes glittering her face retaining its dignity seeming like anangel worthy of silence and respect Then she flung herself upon me something which she had never done before and put hersmooth arms around me and printed a long deep fiery kiss on my lipsAs the sun went down withdrawing its rays from those gardens and orchards Selma moved to the middle of the temple and gazedalong at its walls and corners as if she wanted to pour the light of her eyes on its pictures and symbols Then she walked forward andreverently knelt before the picture of Christ and kissed His feet and she whispered Oh Christ I have chosen Thy Cross anddeserted Ishtars world of pleasure and happiness I have worn the wreath of thorns and discarded the wreath of laurel and washedmyself with blood and tears instead of perfume and scent I have drunk vinegar and gall from a cup which was meant for wine andnectar accept me my Lord among Thy followers and lead me toward Galilee with those who have chosen Thee contended withtheir sufferings and delighted with their sorrowsThen she rose and looked at me and said Now I shall return happily to my dark cave where horrible ghosts reside Do notsympathize with me my beloved and do not feel sorry for me because the soul that sees the shadow of God once will never befrightened thereafter of the ghosts of devils And the eye that looks on heaven once will not be closed by the pains of the worldUttering these words Selma left the place of worship and I remained there lost in a deep sea of thoughts absorbed in the world ofrevelation where God sits on the throne and the angels write down the acts of human beings and the souls recite the tragedy of lifeand the brides of Heaven sing the hymns of love sorrow and immortalityLight had already come when I awakened from my swoon and found myself bewildered in the midst of the gardens repeating theecho of every word uttered by Selma and remembering her silence her actions her movements her expression and the touch of herhands until I realized the meaning of farewell and the pain of lonesomeness I was depressed and heartbroken It was my firstdiscovery of the fact that men even if they are born free will remain slaves of strict laws enacted by their forefathers and that thefirmament which we imagine as unchanging is the yielding of today to the will of tomorrow and submission of yesterday to the willof today  Many a time since the night I have thought of the spiritual law which made Selma prefer death to life and many a time Ihave made a comparison between nobility of sacrifice and happiness of rebellion to find out which one is nobler and more beautifulbut until now I have distilled only one truth out of the whole matter and this truth is sincerity which makes all our deeds beautifuland honorable And this sincerity was in Selma KaramyReturn to the Top Return to the TopChapter 10  The RescuerFive years of Selmas marriage passed without bringing children to strengthen the ties of spiritual relation between her and herhusband and bind their repugnant souls togetherA barren woman is looked upon with disdain everywhere because of most mens desire to perpetuate themselves through posterity7192020 Broken Wings by Kahlil GibrannewthoughtlibrarycomgibranKhalilbrokenWings 1820The substantial man considers his childless wife as an enemy he detests her and deserts her and wishes her death Mansour BeyGalib was that kind of man materially he was like earth and hard like steel and greedy like a grave His desire of having a child tocarry on his name and reputation made him hate Selma in spite of her beauty and sweetnessA tree grown in a cave does not bear fruit and Selma who lived in the shade of life did not bear childrenThe nightingale does not make his nest in a cage lest slavery be the lot of its chicks Selma was a prisoner of misery and it wasHeavens will that she would not have another prisoner to share her life The flowers of the field are the children of suns affectionand natures love and the children of men are the flowers of love and compassionThe spirit of love and compassion never dominated Selmas beautiful home at Ras Beyrouth nevertheless she knelt down on herknees every night before Heaven and asked God for a child in whom she would find comfort and consolation She prayedsuccessively until Heaven answered her prayersThe tree of the cave blossomed to bear fruit at last The nightingale in the cage commenced making its nest with the feathers of itswingsSelma stretched her chained arms toward Heaven to receive Gods precious gift and nothing in the world could have made herhappier than becoming a potential motherShe waited anxiously counting the days and looking forward to the time when Heavens sweetest melody the voice of her childshould ring in her earsShe commenced to see the dawn of a brighter future through her tearsIt was the month of Nisan when Selma was stretched on the bed of pain and labor where life and death were wrestling The doctorand the midwife were ready to deliver to the world a new guest Late at night Selma started her successive cry a cry of lifespartition from life a cry of continuance in the firmament of nothingness a cry of a weak force before the stillness of great forcesthe cry of poor Selma who was lying down in despair under the feet of life and deathAt dawn Selma gave birth to a baby boy When she opened her eyes she saw smiling faces all over the room then she looked againand saw life and death still wrestling by her bed She closed her eyes and cried saying for the first time Oh my son The midwifewrapped the infant with silk swaddles and placed him by his mother but the doctor kept looking at Selma and sorrowfully shakinghis headThe voices of joy woke the neighbors who rushed into the house to felicitate the father upon the birth of his heir but the doctor stillgazed at Selma and her infant and shook his headThe servants hurried to spread the good news to Mansour Bey but the doctor stared at Selma and her child with a disappointed lookon his faceAs the sun came out Selma took the infant to her breast he opened his eyes for the first time and looked at his mother then hequivered and closed them for the last time The doctor took the child from Selmas arms and on his cheeks fell tears then hewhispered to himself He is a departing guestThe child passed away while the neighbors were celebrating with the father in the big hall at the house and drinking to the health oftheir heir and Selma looked at the doctor and pleaded Give me my child and let me embrace himThough the child was dead the sounds of the drinking cups increased in the hallHe was born at dawn and died at sunriseHe was born like a thought and died like a sigh and disappeared like a shadowHe did not live to console and comfort his motherHis life began at the end of the night and ended at the beginning of the day like a drop of few poured by the eyes of the dark anddried by the touch of the lightA pearl brought by the tide to the coast and returned by the ebb into the depth of the seaA lily that has just blossomed from the bud of life and is mashed under the feet of deathA dear guest whose appearance illuminated Selmas heart and whose departure killed her soulThis is the life of men the life of nations the life of suns moons and starsAnd Selma focused her eyes upon the doctor and cried Give me my child and let me embrace him give me my child and let menurse himThen the doctor bent his head His voice choked and he said Your child is dead Madame be patient7192020 Broken Wings by Kahlil GibrannewthoughtlibrarycomgibranKhalilbrokenWings 1920Upon hearing her doctors announcement Selma uttered a terrible cry Then she was quiet for a moment and smiled happily Herface brightened as if she had discovered something and quietly she said Give me my child bring him close to me and let me seehim deadThe doctor carried the dead child to Selma and placed him between her arms She embraced him then turned her face toward thewall and addressed the dead infant saying You have come to take me away my child you have come to show me the way that leadsto the coast Here I am my child lead me and let us leave this dark caveAnd in a minute the suns ray penetrated the window curtains and fell upon two calm bodies lying on a bed guarded by the profounddignity of silence and shaded by the wings of death The doctor left the room with tears in his eyes and as he reached the big hall thecelebrations was converted into a funeral but Mansour Bey Galib never uttered a word or shed a tear He remained standingmotionless like a statue holding a drinking cup with his right handThe second day Selma was shrouded with her white wedding dress and laid in a coffin the childs shroud was his swaddle his coffinwas his mothers arms his grave was her calm breast Two corpses were carried in one coffin and I walked reverently with the crowdaccompanying Selma and her infant to their resting placeArriving at the cemetery Bishop Galib commenced chanting while the other priests prayed and on their gloomy faces appeared aveil of ignorance and emptinessAs the coffin went down one of the bystanders whispered This is the first time in my life I have seen two corpses in one coffinAnother one said It seems as if the child had come to rescue his mother from her pitiless husbandA third one said Look at Mansour Bey he is gazing at the sky as if his eyes were made of glass He does not look like he has lost hiswife and child in one day A fourth one added His uncle the Bishop will marry him again tomorrow to a wealthier and strongerwomanThe Bishop and the priests kept on singing and chanting until the gravedigger was through filing the ditch Then the peopleindividually approached the Bishop and his nephew and offered their respects to them with sweet words of sympathy but I stoodlonely aside without a soul to console me as if Selma and her child meant nothing to meThe farewellbidders left the cemetery the gravedigger stood by the new grave holding a shovel with his handAs I approached him I inquired Do you remember where Farris Effandi Karamy was buriedHe looked at me for a moment then pointed at Selmas grave and said Right here I placed his daughter upon him and upon hisdaughters breast rests her child and upon all I put the earth back with this shovelThen I said In this ditch you have also buried my heartAs the gravedigger disappeared behind the poplar trees I could not resist anymore I dropped down on Selmas grave and weptReturn to the Top Return to the TopINDEX OFSCRIPTURAL REFERENCESAND QUOTATIONS  Return to the Top Return to the TopDid you enjoy

attention to long periods as if beneath the shifts and changes of political events they were trying to reveal the stable almost indestructible system of checks and balances the irreversible processes the constant readjustments the underlying tendencies that gather force and are then suddenly reversed after centuries of continuity the movements of accumulation and slow saturation the great silent motionless bases that traditional history has covered with a thick layer of events The tools that enable historians to carry out this work of analysis are partly inherited and partly of their own making models of economic growth quantitative analysis of market movements accounts of demographic expansion and contraction the study of climate and its longterm changes the fixing of sociological constants the description of technological adjustments and of their spread and continuity These tools have enabled workers in the historical field to distinguish various sedimentary strata linear successions which for so long had been the object of research have given way to discoveries in depth From the political mobility at the surface down to the slow movements of material civilization ever more levels of analysis have been established each has its own peculiar discontinuities and patterns and as one descends to the deepest levels the rhythms become broader Beneath the rapidly 4 changing history of governments wars and famines there emerge other apparently unmoving histories the history of sea routes the history of corn or of goldmining the history of drought and of irrigation the history of crop rotation the history of the balance achieved by the human species between hunger and abundance The old questions of the traditional analysis What link should be made between disparate events How can a causal succession be established between them What continuity or overall significance do they possess Is it possible to define a totality or must one be content with reconstituting connexions are now being replaced by questions of another type which strata should be isolated from others What types of series should be established What criteria of periodization should be adopted for each of them What system of relations hierarchy dominance stratification univocal determination circular causality may be established between them What series of series may be established And in what largescale chronological table may distinct series of events be determined At about the same time in the disciplines that we call the history of ideas the history of science the history of philosophy the history of thought and the history of literature we can ignore their specificity for the moment in those disciplines which despite their names evade very largely the work and methods of the historian attention has been turned on the contrary away from vast unities like periods or centuries to the phenomena of rupture of discontinuity Beneath the great continuities of thought beneath the solid homogeneous manifestations of a single mind or of a collective mentality beneath the stubborn development of a science striving to exist and to reach completion at the very outset beneath the persistence of a particular genre form discipline or theoretical activity one is now trying to detect the incidence of interruptions Interruptions whose status and nature vary considerably There are the epistemological acts and thresholds described by Bachelard they suspend the continuous accumulation of knowledge interrupt its slow development and force it to enter a new time cut it off from its empirical origin and its original motivations cleanse it of its imaginary complicities they direct historical analysis away from the search for silent beginnings and the neverending tracingback to the original precursors towards the search for a new type of rationality 5 and its various effects There are the displacements and transformations of concepts the analyses of G Canguilhem may serve as models they show that the history of a concept is not wholly and entirely that of its progressive refinement its continuously increasing rationality its abstraction gradient but that of its various fields of constitution and validity that of its successive rules of use that of the many theoretical contexts in which it developed and matured There is the distinction which we also owe to Canguilhem between the microscopic and macroscopic scales of the history of the sciences in which events and their consequences are not arranged in the same way thus a discovery the development of a method the achievements and the failures of a particular scientist do not have the same incidence and cannot be described in the same way at both levels on each of the two levels a different history is being written Recurrent redistributions reveal several pasts several forms of connexion several hierarchies of importance several networks of determination several teleologies for one and the same science as its present undergoes change thus historical descriptions are necessarily ordered by the present state of knowledge they increase with every transformation and never cease in turn to break with themselves in the field of mathematics M Serres has provided the theory of this phenomenon There are the architectonic unities of systems of the kind analysed by M Gueroult which are concerned not with the description of cultural influences traditions and continuities but with internal coherences axioms deductive connexions compatibilities Lastly the most radical discontinuities are the breaks effected by a work of theoretical transformation which establishes a science by detaching it from the ideology of its past and by revealing this past as ideological To this should be added of course literary analysis which now takes as its unity not the spirit or sensibility of a period nor groups schools generations or movements nor even the personality of the author in the interplay of his life and his creation but the particular structure of a given auvre book or text And the great problem presented by such historical analyses is not how continuities are established how a single pattern is formed and preserved how for so many different successive minds there is a single   footnote L Althusser For Marx London Allen Lane New York Pantheon 1969 p 168   6 horizon what mode of action and what substructure is implied by the interplay of transmissions resumptions disappearances and repetitions how the origin may extend its sway well beyond itself to that conclusion that is never given  the problem is no longer one of tradition of tracing a line but one of division of limits it is no longer one of lasting foundations but one of transformations that serve as new foundations the rebuilding of foundations What one is seeing then is the emergence of a whole field of questions some of which are already familiar by which this new form of history is trying to develop its own theory how is one to specify the different concepts that enable us to conceive of discontinuity threshold rupture break mutation transformation  By what criteria is one to isolate the unities with which one is dealing what is a science What is an oeuvre What is a theory What is a concept What is a text How is one to diversify the levels at which one may place oneself each of which possesses its own divisions and form of analysis What is the legitimate level of formalization What is that of interpretation Of structural analysis Of attributions of causality In short the history of thought of knowledge of philosophy of literature seems to be seeking and discovering more and more discontinuities whereas history itself appears to be abandoning the irruption of events in favour of stable structures  But we must not be taken in by this apparent interchange Despite appearances we must not imagine that certain of the historical disciplines have moved from the continuous to the discontinuous while others have moved from the tangled mass of discontinuities to the great uninterrupted unities we must not imagine that in the analysis of politics institutions or economics we have become more and more sensitive to overall determinations while in the analysis of ideas and of knowledge we are paying more and more attention to the play of difference we must not imagine that these two great forms of description have crossed without recognizing one another In fact the same problems are being posed in either case but they have provoked opposite effects on the surface These problems may be summed up in a word the questioning of the document Of course it is obvious enough that ever since a discipline such as history has existed 7 documents have been used questioned and have given rise to questions scholars have asked not only what these documents meant but also whether they were telling the truth and by what right they could claim to be doing so whether they were sincere or deliberately misleading well informed or ignorant authentic or tampered with But each of these questions and all this critical concern pointed to one and the same end the reconstitution on the basis of what the documents say and sometimes merely hint at of the past from which they emanate and which has now disappeared far behind them the document was always treated as the language of a voice since reduced to silence its fragile but possibly decipherable trace Now through a mutation that is not of very recent origin but which has still not come to an end history has altered its position in relation to the document it has taken as its primary task not the interpretation of the document nor the attempt to decide whether it is telling the truth or what is its expressive value but to work on it from within and to develop it history now organizes the document divides it up distributes it orders it arranges it in levels establishes series distinguishes between what is relevant and what is not discovers elements defines unities describes relations The document then is no longer for history an inert material through which it tries to reconstitute what men have done or said the events of which only the trace remains history is now trying to define within the documentary material itself unities totalities series relations History must be detached from the image that satisfied it for so long and through which it found its anthropological justification that of an ageold collective consciousness that made use of material documents to refresh its memory history is the work expended on material documentation books texts accounts registers acts buildings institutions laws techniques objects customs etc that exists in every time and place in every society either in a spontaneous or in a consciously organized form The document is not the fortunate tool of a history that is primarily and fundamentally memory history is one way in which a society recognizes and develops a mass of documentation with which it is inextricably linked To be brief then let us say that history in its traditional form undertook to memorize the monuments of the past transform them into documents and lend speech to those traces which in themselves are   8 often not verbal or which say in silence something other than what they actually say in our time history is that which transforms documents into monuments In that area where in the past history deciphered the traces left by men it now deploys a mass of elements that have to be grouped made relevant placed in relation to one another to form totalities There was a time when archaeology as a discipline devoted to silent monuments inert traces objects without context and things left by the past aspired to the condition of history and attained meaning only through the restitution of a historical discourse it might be said to play on words a little that in our time history aspires to the condition of archaeology to the intrinsic description of the monument This has several consequences First of all there is the surface effect already mentioned the proliferation of discontinuities in the history of ideas and the emergence of long periods in history proper In fact in its traditional form history proper was concerned to define relations of simple causality of circular determination of antagonism of expression between facts or dated events the series being known it was simply a question of defining the position of each element in relation to the other elements in the series The problem now is to constitute series to define the elements proper to each series to fix its boundaries to reveal its own specific type of relations to formulate its laws  and beyond this to describe the relations between different series thus constituting series of series or tables hence the everincreasing number of strata and the need to distinguish them the specificity of their time and chronologies hence the need to distinguish not only important events with a long chain of consequences and less important ones but types of events at quite different levels some very brief others of average duration like the development of a particular technique or a scarcity of money and others of a longterm nature like a demographic equilibrium or the gradual adjustment of an economy to climatic change hence the possibility of revealing series with widely spaced intervals formed by rare or repetitive events The appearance of long periods in the history of today is not a return to the philosophers of history to the great ages of the world or to the periodization dictated by the rise and fall of civilizations it is the effect of the methodologically concerted development   9  of series In the history of ideas of thought and of the sciences the same mutation has brought about the opposite effect it has broken up the long series formed by the progress of consciousness or the teleology of reason or the evolution of human thought it has questioned the themes of convergence and culmination it has doubted the possibility of creating totalities It has led to the individualization of different series which are juxtaposed to one another follow one another overlap and intersect without one being able to reduce them to a liner schema Thus in place of the continuous chronology of reason which was invariably traced back to some inaccessible origin there have appeared scales that are sometimes very brief distinct from one another irreducible to a single law scales that bear a type of history peculiar to each one and which cannot be reduced to the general model of a consciousness that acquires progresses and remembers Second consequence the notion of discontinuity assumes a major role in the historical disciplines For history in its classical form the discontinuous was both the given and the unthinkable the raw material of history which presented itself in the form of dispersed events  decisions accidents initiatives discoveries the material which through analysis had to be rearranged reduced effaced in order to reveal the continuity of events Discontinuity was the stigma of temporal dislocation that it was the historians task to remove from history It has now become one of the basic elements of historical analysis Its role is threefold First it constitutes a deliberate operation on the part of the historian and not a quality of the material with which he has to deal for the must at least as a systematic hypothesis distinguish the possible levels of analysis the methods proper to each and the periodization that best suits them Secondly it is the result of his description and not something that must be eliminated by means of his analysis  for he is trying to discover the limits of a process the point of inflexion of a curve the inversion of a regulatory movement the boundaries of an oscillation the threshold of a function the instant at which a circular causality breaks down Thirdly it is the concept that the historians work never ceases to specify instead of neglecting it as a uniform indifferent blank between two positive figures  it assumes a specific form and function according to the field and the level to which it is assigned one does not speak of the same discontinuity when 10 describing an epistemological threshold the point of reflexion in a population curve or the replacement of one technique by another The notion of discontinuity is a paradoxical one because it is both an instrument and an object of research because it divides up the field of which it is the effect because it enables the historian to individualize different domains but can be established only by comparing those domains And because in the final analysis perhaps it is not simply a concept present in the discourse of the historian but something that the historian secretly supposes to be present on what basis in fact could he speak without this discontinuity that offers him history  and his own history  as an object One of the most essential features of the new history is probably this displacement of the discontinuous its transference from the obstacle to the work itself its integration into the discourse of the historian where it no longer plays the role of an external condition that must be reduced but that of a working concept and therefore the inversion of signs by which it is no longer the negative of the historical reading its underside its failure the limit of its power but the positive element that determines its object and validates its analysis Third consequence the theme and the possibility of a total history begin to disappear and we see the emergence of something very different that might be called a general history The project of a total history is one that seeks to reconstitute the overall form of a civilization the principle  material or spiritual  of a society the significance common to all the phenomena of a period the law that accounts for their cohesion  what is called metaphorically the face of a period Such a project is linked to two or three hypotheses it is supposed that between all the events of a welldefined spatiotemporal area between all the phenomena of which traces have been found it must be possible to establish a system of homogeneous relations a network of causality that makes it possible to derive each of them relations of analogy that show how they symbolize one another or how they all express one and the same central core it is also supposed that one and the same form of historicity operates upon economic structures social institutions and customs the inertia of mental attitudes technological practice political behaviour and subjects them all to the same type of transformation lastly it is supposed that history itself may be articulated into   11 great units  stages or phases  which contain within themselves their own principle of cohesion These are the postulates that are challenged by the new history when it speaks of series divisions limits differences of level shifts chronological specificities particular forms of rehandling possible types of relation This is not because it is trying to obtain a plurality of histories juxtaposed and independent of one another that of the economy beside that of institutions and beside these two those of science religion or literature nor is it because it is merely trying to discover between these different histories coincidences of dates or analogies of form and meaning The problem that now presents itself  and which defines the task of a general history  is to determine what form of relation may be legitimately described between these different series what vertical system they are capable of forming what interplay of correlation and dominance exists between them what may be the effect of shifts different temporalities and various rehandlings in what distinct totalities certain elements may figure simultaneously in short not only what series but also what series of series  or in other words what tables it is possible to draw up A total description draws all phenomena around a single centre  a principle a meaning a spirit a worldview an overall shape a general history on the contrary would deploy the space of a dispersion Fourth and last consequence the new history is confronted by a number of methodological problems several of which no doubt existed long before the emergence of the new history but which taken together characterize it These include the buildingup of coherent and homogeneous corpora of documents open or closed exhausted or inexhaustible corpora the establishment of a principle of choice according to whether one wishes to treat the documentation exhaustively or adopt a sampling method as in statistics or try to determine in advance which are the most representative elements  the definition of the level of analysis and of the relevant elements in the material studied one may extract numerical indications references  explicit or not  to events institutions practices the words used with their grammatical rules and the semantic fields that they indicate or again the formal structure of the propositions and the types of connexion that unite them the specification of a method of analysis the quantitative treatment of data the breakingdown of the material according to a   12 number of assignable features whose correlations are then studied interpretative decipherment analysis of frequency and distribution the delimitation of groups and subgroups that articulate the material regions periods unitary processes  the determination of relations that make it possible to characterize a group these may be numerical or logical relations functional causal or analogical relations or it may be the relation of the signifier signifiant to the signified signifie All these problems are now part of the methodological field of history This field deserves attention and for two reasons First because one can see to what extent it has freed itself from what constituted not so long ago the philosophy of history and from the questions that it posed on the rationality or teleology of historical development devenir on the relativity of historical knowledge and on the possibility of discovering or constituting a meaning in the inertia of the past and in the unfinished totality of the present Secondly because it intersects at certain points problems that are met with in other fields  in linguistics ethnology economics literary analysis and mythology for example These problems may if one so wishes be labelled structuralism But only under certain conditions they do not of themselves cover the entire methodological field of history they occupy only one part of that field  a part that varies in importance with the area and level of analysis apart from a number of relatively limited cases they have not been imported from linguistics or ethnology as is often the case today but they originated in the field of history itself  more particularly in that of economic history and as a result of the questions posed by that discipline lastly in no way do they authorize us to speak of a structuralism of history or at least of an attempt to overcome a conflict or opposition between structure and historical development it is a long time now since historians uncovered described and analysed structures without ever having occasion to wonder whether they were not allowing the living fragile pulsating history to slip through their fingers The structuredevelopment opposition is relevant neither to the definition of the historical field nor in all probability to the definition of a structural method This epistemological mutation of history is not yet complete But it is not of recent origin either since its first phase can no doubt be traced   13 back to Marx But it took a long time to have much effect Even now  and this is especially true in the case of the history of thought  it has been neither registered nor reflected upon while other more recent transformations  those of linguistics for example  have been It is as if it was particularly difficult in the history in which men retrace their own ideas and their own knowledge to formulate a general theory of discontinuity of series of limits unities specific orders and differentiated autonomies and dependences As if in that field where we had become used to seeking origins to pushing back further and further the line of antecedents to reconstituting traditions to following evolutive curves to projecting teleologies and to having constant recourse to metaphors of life we felt a particular repugnance to conceiving of difference to describing separations and dispersions to dissociating the reassuring form of the identical Or to be more precise as if we found it difficult to construct a theory to draw general conclusions and even to derive all the possible implications of these concepts of thresholds mutations independent systems and limited series  in the way in which they had been used in fact by historians As if we were afraid to conceive of the Other in the time of our own thought There is a reason for this If the history of thought could remain the locus of uninterrupted continuities if it could endlessly forge connexions that no analysis could undo without abstraction if it could weave around everything that men say and do obscure synthesis that anticipate for him prepare him and lead him endlessly towards his future it would provide a privileged shelter for the sovereignty of consciousness Continuous history is the indispensable correlative of the founding function of the subject the guarantee that everything that has eluded him may be restored to him the certainty that time will disperse nothing without restoring it in a reconstituted unity the promise that one day the subject  in the form of historical consciousness  will once again be able to appropriate to bring back under his sway all those things that are kept at a distance by difference and find in them what might be called his abode Making historical analysis the discourse of the continuous and making human consciousness the original subject of all historical development and all action are the two sides of the same system of thought In this system time is conceived in terms of totalization and revolutions are never more than moments of consciousness  14  In various forms this theme has played a constant role since the nineteenth century to preserve against all decentrings the sovereignty of the subject and the twin figures of anthropology and humanism Against the decentring operated by Marx  by the historical analysis of the relations of production economic determinations and the class struggle  it gave place towards the end of the nineteenth century to the search for a total history in which all the differences of a society might be reduced to a single form to the organization of a worldview to the establishment of a system of values to a coherent type of civilization To the decentring operated by the Nietzschean genealogy it opposed the search for an original foundation that would make rationality the telos of mankind and link the whole history of thought to the preservation of this rationality to the maintenance of this teleology and to the ever necessary return to this foundation Lastly more recently when the researches of psychoanalysis linguistics and ethnology have decentred the subject in relation to the laws of his desire the forms of his language the rules of his action or the games of his mythical or fabulous discourse when it became clear that man himself questioned as to what he was could not account for his sexuality and his unconscious the systematic forms of his language or the regularities of his fictions the theme of a continuity of history has been reactivated once again a history that would be not division but development devenir not an interplay of relations but an internal dynamic not a system but the hard work of freedom not form but the unceasing effort of a consciousness turned upon itself trying to grasp itself in its deepest conditions a history that would be both an act of long uninterrupted patience and the vivacity of a movement which in the end breaks all bounds If one is to assert this theme which to the immobility of structures to their closed system to their necessary synchrony opposes the living openness of history one must obviously deny in the historical analyses themselves the use of discontinuity the definition of levels and limits the description of specific series the uncovering of the whole interplay of differences One is led therefore to anthropologize Marx to make of him a historian of totalities and to rediscover in him the message of humanism one is led therefore 15 to interpret Nietzsche in the terms of transcendental philosophy and to reduce his genealogy to the level of a search for origins lastly one is led to leave to one side as if it had never arisen that whole field of methodological problems that the new history is now presenting For if it is asserted that the question of discontinuities systems and transformations series and thresholds arises in all the historical disciplines and in those concerned with ideas or the sciences no less than those concerned with economics and society how could one oppose with any semblance of legitimacy development and system movement and circular regulations or as it is sometimes put crudely and unthinkingly history and structure The same conservative function is at work in the theme of cultural totalities for which Marx has been criticized then travestied in the theme of a search for origins which was opposed to Nietzsche before an attempt was made to transpose him into it and in the theme of a living continuous open history The cry goes up that one is murdering history whenever in a historical analysis  and especially if it is concerned with thought ideas or knowledge  one is seen to be using in too obvious a way the categories of discontinuity and difference the notions of threshold rupture and transformation the description of series and limits One will be denounced for attacking the inalienable rights of history and the very foundations of any possible historicity But one must not be deceived what is being bewailed with such vehemence is not the disappearance of history but the eclipse of that form of history that was secretly but entirely related to the synthetic activity of the subject what is being bewailed is the development devenir that was to provide the sovereignty of the consciousness with a safer less exposed shelter than myths kinship systems languages sexuality or desire what is being bewailed is the possibility of reanimating through the project the work of meaning or the movement of totalization the interplay of material determinations rules of practice unconscious systems rigorous but unreflected relations correlations that elude all lived experience what is being bewailed is that ideological use of history by which one tries to restore to man everything that has unceasingly eluded him for over a hundred years All the treasure of bygone days was crammed into the old citadel of this history it was thought to be secure it was sacralized it was made the last 16 restingplace of anthropological thought it was even thought that its most inveterate enemies could be captured and turned into vigilant guardians But the historians had long ago deserted the old fortress and gone to work elsewhere it was realized that neither Marx nor Nietzsche were carrying out the guard duties that had been entrusted to them They could not be depended on to preserve privilege nor to affirm once and for all  and God knows it is needed in the distress of today  that history at least is living and continuous that it is for the subject in question a place of rest certainty reconciliation a place of tranquillized sleep At this point there emerges an enterprise of which my earlier hooks Histoire de la folie Madness and Civilization Naissance de la clinique and Les Mots et les choses The Order of Things were a very imperfect sketch An enterprise by which one tries to measure the mutations that operate in general in the field of history an enterprise in which the methods limits and themes proper to the history of ideas are questioned an enterprise by which one tries to throw off the last anthropological constraints an enterprise that wishes in return to reveal how these constraints could come about These tasks were outlined in a rather disordered way and their general articulation was never clearly defined It was time that they were given greater coherence  or at least that an attempt was made to do so This book is the result In order to avoid misunderstanding I should like to begin with a few observations My aim is not to transfer to the field of history and more particularly to the history of knowledge connaissances3 a structuralist  footnote   Madness and Civilization New York Random House 1965 London Tavistock 1967 The Order of Things London Tavistock New York Pantheon 1970 A translation of Naissance de la clinique was published in 1973 TavistockPantheon  The English knowledge translates the French connaissance and savoir Connaissance refers here to a particular corpus of knowledge a particular discipline  biology or economics for example Savoir which is usually defined as knowledge in general the totality of connaissnnces is used by Foucault in an underlying rather than an overall way He has himself offered the following comment on his usage of the terms By connaissance I mean the relation of the subject to the object and the formal rules that govern it Savoir refers to the conditions that are necessary in a particular period for this 17 method that has proved valuable in other fields of analysis My aim is to uncover the principles and consequences of an autochthonous transformation that is taking place in the field of historical knowledge It may well be that this transformation the problems that it raises the tools that it uses the concepts that emerge from it and the results that it obtains are not entirely foreign to what is called structural analysis But this kind of analysis is not specifically used  my aim is most decidedly not to use the categories of cultural totalities whether worldviews ideal types the particular spirit of an age in order to impose on history despite itself the forms of structural analysis The series described the limits fixed the comparisons and correlations made are based not on the old philosophies of history but are intended to question teleologien and totalizations  in so far as my aim is to define a method of historical analysis freed from the anthropological theme it is clear that the theory that I am about to outline has a dual relation with the previous studies It is an attempt to formulate in general terms and not without a great deal of rectification and elaboration the tools that these studies have used or forged for themselves in the course of their work But on the other hand it uses the results already obtained to define a method of analysis purged of all anthropologism The ground on which it rests is the one that it has itself discovered The studies of madness and the beginnings of psychology of illness and the beginnings of a clinical medicine of the sciences of life language and economics were attempts that were carried out to some extent in the dark but they gradually became clear not only because little by little their method became more precise but also because they discovered  in this debate on humanism and anthropology  the point of its historical possibility  In short this book like those that preceded it does not belong  at least directly or in the first instance  to the debate on structure as  footnote or that type of object to he given to connaissance and for this or that enunciation to he formulated Throughout this translation I have used the English word followed where the meaning required it by the appropriate French word in parentheses Tr 18 opposed to genesis history development it belongs to that field in which the questions of the human being consciousness origin and the subject emerge intersect mingle and separate off But it would probably not be incorrect to say that the problem of structure arose there too This work is not an exact description of what can be read in Madness and Civilization Naissance de la clinique or The Order of Things It is different on a great many points It also includes a number of corrections and internal criticisms Generally speaking Madness and Civilization accorded far too great a place and a very enigmatic one too to what I called an experiment thus showing to what extent one was still close to admitting an anonymous and general subject of history in Naissance de la clinique the frequent recourse to structural analysis threatened to bypass the specificity of the problem presented and the level proper to archaeology lastly in The Order of Things the absence of methodological signposting may have given the impression that my analyses were being conducted in terms of cultural totality It is mortifying that I was unable to avoid these dangers I console myself with the thought that they were intrinsic to the enterprise itself since in order to carry out its task it had first to free itself from these various methods and forms of history moreover without the questions that I was asked without the difficulties that arose without the objections that were made I may never have gained so clear a view of the enterprise to which I am now inextricably linked Hence the cautious stumbling manner of this text at every turn it stands back measures up what is before it gropes towards its limits stumbles against what it does not mean and digs pits to mark out its own path At every turn it denounces any possible confusion It rejects its identity without previously stating I am neither this nor that It is not critical most of the time it is not a way of saying that everyone else is wrong It is an attempt to define a particular site by the exteriority of its vicinity rather than trying to reduce others to silence by claiming that what they say is worthless I have tried to define this blank space from which I speak  footnote   In particular the first pages of this introduction are based on a reply to questions presented by the Cercle dEpistemologic of the ENS cf Cahiers pour analyse no 9 A sketch of certain developments was also given in reply to readers of the review Esprit April 1968 19 and which is slowly taking shape in a discourse that I still feel to be so precarious and so unsure  Arent you sure of what youre saying Are you going to change yet again shift your position according to the questions that are put to you and say that the objections are not really directed at the place from which you are speaking Are you going to declare yet again that you have never been what you have been reproached with being Are you already preparing the way out that will enable you in your next book to spring up somewhere else and declare as youre now doing no no Im not where you are lying in wait for me but over here laughing at you What do you imagine that I would take so much trouble and so much pleasure in writing do you think that I would keep so persistently to my task if I were not preparing  with a rather shaky hand  a labyrinth into which I can venture in which I can move my discourse opening up underground passages forcing it to go far from itself finding overhangs that reduce and deform its itinerary in which I can lose myself and appear at last to eyes that I will never have to meet again I am no doubt not the only one who writes in order to have no face Do not ask who I am and do not ask me to remain the same leave it to our bureaucrats and our police to see that our papers are in order At least spare us their morality when we write Part II The Discursive Regularities 23   1 THE UNITIES OF DISCOURSE The use of concepts of discontinuity rupture threshold limit series and transformation present all historical analysis not only with questions of procedure but with theoretical problems It is these problems that will be studied here the questions of procedure will be examined in later empirical studies  if the opportunity the desire and the courage to undertake them do not desert me These theoretical problems too will be examined only in a particular field in those disciplines  so unsure of their frontiers and so vague in content  that we call the history of ideas or of thought or of science or of knowledge But there is a negative work to be carried out first we must rid ourselves of a whole mass of notions each of which in its own way diversifies the theme of continuity They may not have a very rigorous conceptual structure but they have a very precise function Take the notion of tradition it is intended to give a special temporal status to a group of phenomena that are both successive and identical or at least similar it makes it possible to rethink the dispersion of history in the form of the same it allows a reduction of the difference proper to every beginning in order to pursue without discontinuity the endless search for the origin tradition enables us to isolate the new against a background of permanence and to transfer its merit to originality to genius to the decisions proper to individuals Then there is the notion  24 of influence which provides a support  of too magical a kind to be very amenable to analysis  for the facts of transmission and communication which refers to an apparently causal process but with neither rigorous delimitation nor theoretical definition the phenomena of resemblance or repetition which links at a distance and through time  as if through the mediation of a medium of propagation  such defined unities as individuals oeuvres notions or theories There are the notions of development and evolution they make it possible to group a succession of dispersed events to link them to one and the same organizing principle to subject them to the exemplary power of life with its adaptations its capacity for innovation the incessant correlation of its different elements its systems of assimilation and exchange to discover already at work in each beginning a principle of coherence and the outline of a future unity to master time through a perpetually reversible relation between an origin and a term that are never given but are always at work There is the notion of spirit which enables us to establish between the simultaneous or successive phenomena of a given period a community of meanings symbolic links an interplay of resemblance and reflexion or which allows the sovereignty of collective consciousness to emerge as the principle of unity and explanation We must question those readymade syntheses those groupings that we normally accept before any examination those links whose validity is recognized from the outset we must oust those forms and obscure forces by which we usually link the discourse of one man with that of another they must be driven out from the darkness in which they reign And instead of according them unqualified spontaneous value we must accept in the name of methodological rigour that in the first instance they concern only a population of dispersed events We must also question those divisions or groupings with which we have become so familiar Can one accept as such the distinction between the major types of discourse or that between such forms or genres as science literature philosophy religion history fiction etc and which tend to create certain great historical individualities We are not even sure of ourselves when we use these distinctions in our own world of discourse let alone when we are analysing groups of statements which when first formulated were distributed divided and characterized in a quite different way after all literature and politics 25 are recent categories which can be applied to medieval culture or even classical culture only by a retrospective hypothesis and by an interplay of formal analogies or semantic resemblances but neither literature nor politics nor philosophy and the sciences articulated the field of discourse in the seventeenth or eighteenth century as they did in the nineteenth century In any case these divisions  whether our own or those contemporary with the discourse under examination  are always themselves reflexive categories principles of classification normative rules institutionalized types they in turn are facts of discourse that deserve to be analysed beside others of course they also have complex relations with each other but they are not intrinsic autochthonous and universally recognizable characteristics But the unities that must be suspended above all are those that emerge in the most immediate way those of the book and the oeuvre At first sight it would seem that one could not abandon these unities without extreme artificiality Are they not given in the most definite way There is the material individualization of the book which occupies a determined space which has an economic value and which itself indicates by a number of signs the limits of its beginning and its end and there is the establishment of an oeuvre which we recognize and delimit by attributing a certain number of texts to an author And yet as soon as one looks at the matter a little more closely the difficulties begin The material unity of the book Is this the same in the case of an anthology of poems a collection of posthumous fragments Desargues Traite des Coniques or a volume of Michelets Histoire de France Is it the same in the case of Mallarmes Un Coup de des the trial of Gilles de Rais Butors San Marco or a Catholic missal In other words is not the material unity of the volume a weak accessory unity in relation to the discursive unity of which it is the support But is this discursive unity itself homogeneous and uniformly applicable A novel by Stendhal and a novel by Dostoevsky do not have the same relation of individuality as that between two novels belonging to Balzacs cycle La Comedic humaine and the relation between Balzacs novels is not the same as that existing between Joyces Ulysses and the Odyssey The frontiers of a book are never clearcut beyond the title the first lines and the last full stop beyond its internal configuration and its autonomous form it is caught up in a system of references to other books other texts other sentences it is a 26 node within a network And this network of references is not the same in the case of a mathematical treatise a textual commentary a historical account and an episode in a novel cycle the unity of the book even in the sense of a group of relations cannot be regarded as identical in each case The book is not simply the object that one holds in ones hands and it cannot remain within the little parallelepiped that contains it its unity is variable and relative As soon as one questions that unity it loses its selfevidence it indicates itself constructs itself only on the basis of a complex field of discourse The problems raised by the oeuvre are even more difficult Yet at first sight what could be more simple A collection of texts that can be designated by the sign of a proper name But this designation even leaving to one side problems of attribution is not a homogeneous function does the name of an author designate in the same way a text that he has published under his name a text that he has presented under a pseudonym another found after his death in the form of an unfinished draft and another that is merely a collection of jottings a notebook The establishment of a complete oeuvre presupposes a number of choices that are difficult to justify or even to formulate is it enough to add to the texts published by the author those that he intended for publication but which remained unfinished by the fact of his death Should one also include all his sketches and first drafts with all their corrections and crossings out Should one add sketches that he himself abandoned And what status should be given to letters notes reported conversations transcriptions of what he said made by those present at the time in short to that vast mass of verbal traces left by an individual at his death and which speak in an endless confusion so many different languages Iangages In any case the name Mallarme does not refer in the same way to his themes translation exercises from French into English his translations of Edgar Allan Poe his poems and his replies to questionnaires similarly the same relation does not exist between the name Nietzsche on the one hand and the youthful  footnote   The English word language translates the French langue meaning the natural languages French English etc and langage meaning either language in general or kinds of language philosophical medical language etc Where the meaning would otherwise be unclear I have added the original French word in brackets Te 27 autobiographies the scholastic dissertations the philological articles Zarathustra Ecce Homo the letters the last postcards signed Dionysos or Kaiser Nietzsche and the innumerable notebooks with their jumble of laundry bills and sketches for aphorisms In fact if one speaks so undiscriminately and unreflectingly of an authors oeuvre it is because one imagines it to be defined by a certain expressive function One is admitting that there must be a level as deep as it is necessary to imagine it at which the oeuvre emerges in all its fragments even the smallest most inessential ones as the expression of the thought the experience the imagination or the unconscious of the author or indeed of the historical determinations that operated upon him But it is at once apparent that such a unity far from being given immediately is the result of an operation that this operation is interpretative since it deciphers in the text the transcription of something that it both conceals and manifests and that the operation that determines the opus in its unity and consequently the oeuvre itself will not be the same in the case of the author of Le Theatre et son Double Artaud and the author of the Tractatus Wittgenstein and therefore when one speaks of an oeuvre in each case one is using the word in a different sense The oeuvre can be regarded neither as an immediate unity nor as a certain unity nor as a homogeneous unity One last precaution must be taken to disconnect the unquestioned continuities by which we organize in advance the discourse that we are to analyse we must renounce two linked but opposite themes The first involves a wish that it should never be possible to assign in the order of discourse the irruption of a real event that beyond any apparent beginning there is always a secret origin  so secret and so fundamental that it can never be quite grasped in itself Thus one is led inevitably through the naivety of chronologies towards an everreceding point that is never itself present in any history this point is merely its own void and from that point all beginnings can never be more than recommencements or occultation in one and the same gesture this and that To this theme is connected another according to which all manifest discourse is secretly based on an alreadysaid and that this alreadysaid is not merely a phrase that has already been spoken or a text that has already been written but a neversaid an incorporeal discourse a voice as silent as a breath a writing that is 28 merely the hollow of its own mark It is supposed therefore that everything that is formulated in discourse was already articulated in that semisilence that precedes it which continues to run obstinately beneath it but which it covers and silences The manifest discourse therefore is really no more than the repressive presence of what it does not say and this notsaid is a hollow that undermines from within all that is said The first theme sees the historical analysis of discourse as the quest for and the repetition of an origin that eludes all historical determination the second sees it as the interpretation of hearing of an alreadysaid that is at the same time a notsaid We must renounce all those themes whose function is to ensure the infinite continuity of discourse and its secret presence to itself in the interplay of a constantly recurring absence We must be ready to receive every moment of discourse in its sudden irruption in that punctuality in which it appears and in that temporal dispersion that enables it to be repeated known forgotten transformed utterly erased and hidden far from all view in the dust of books Discourse must not be referred to the distant presence of the origin but treated as and when it occurs These preexisting forms of continuity all these syntheses that are accepted without question must remain in suspense They must not be rejected definitively of course but the tranquillity with which they are accepted must be disturbed we must show that they do not come about of themselves but are always the result of a construction the rules of which must be known and the justifications of which must be scrutinized we must define in what conditions and in view of which analyses certain of them are legitimate and we must indicate which of them can never be accepted in any circumstances It may be for example that the notions of influence or evolution belong to a criticism that puts them  for the foreseeable future  out of use But need we dispense for ever with the oeuvre the book or even such unities as science or literature Should we regard them as illusions illegitimate constructions or illacquired results Should we never make use of them even as a temporary support and never provide them with a definition What we must do in fact is to tear away from them their virtual selfevidence and to free the problems that they pose to recognize that they are not the tranquil locus on the 29 basis of which other questions concerning their structure coherence systematicity transformations may be posed but that they themselves pose a whole cluster of questions What are they How can they be defined or limited What distinct types of laws can they obey What articulation are they capable of What subgroups can they give rise to What specific phenomena do they reveal in the field of discourse We must recognize that they may not in the last resort be what they seem at first sight In short that they require a theory and that this theory cannot be constructed unless the field of the facts of discourse on the basis of which those facts are built up appears in its nonsynthetic purity And I in turn will do no more than this of course I shall take as my startingpoint whatever unities are already given such as psychopathology medicine or political economy  but I shall not place myself inside these dubious unities in order to study their internal configuration or their secret contradictions I shall make use of them just long enough to ask myself what unities they form by what right they can claim a field that specifies them in space and a continuity that individualizes them in time according to what laws they are formed against the background of which discursive events they stand out and whether they are not in their accepted and quasiinstitutional individuality ultimately the surface effect of more firmly grounded unities I shall accept the groupings that history suggests only to subject them at once to interrogation to break them up and then to see whether they can be legitimately reformed or whether other groupings should be made to replace them in a more general space which while dissipating their apparent familiarity makes it possible to construct a theory of them Once these immediate forms of continuity are suspended an entire field is set free A vast field but one that can be defined nonetheless this field is made up of the totality of all effective statements whether spoken or written in their dispersion as events and in the occurrence that is proper to them Before approaching with any degree of certainty a science or novels or political speeches or the oeuvre of an author or even a single book the material with which one is dealing is in its raw neutral state a population of events in the space of discourse in general One is led therefore to the project of a pure description of discursive events as the horizon for the search for the unities that form 30 within it This description is easily distinguishable from an analysis of the language Of course a linguistic system can be established unless it is constructed artificially only by using a corpus of statements or a collection of discursive facts but we must then define on the basis of this grouping which has value as a sample rules that may make it possible to construct other statements than these even if it has long since disappeared even if it is no longer spoken and can be reconstructed only on the basis of rare fragments a language longue is still a system for possible statements a finite body of rules that authorizes an infinite number of performances The field of discursive events on the other hand is a grouping that is always finite and limited at any moment to the linguistic sequences that have been formulated they may be innumerable they may in sheer size exceed the capacities of recording memory or reading nevertheless they form a finite grouping The question posed by language analysis of some discursive fact or other is always according to what rules has a particular statement been made and consequently according to what rules could other similar statements be made The description of the events of discourse poses a quite different question how is it that one particular statement appeared rather than another It is also clear that this description of discourses is in opposition to the history of thought There too a system of thought can be reconstituted only on the basis of a definite discursive totality But this totality is treated in such a way that one tries to rediscover beyond the statements themselves the intention of the speaking subject his conscious activity what he meant or again the unconscious activity that took place despite himself in what he said or in the almost imperceptible fracture of his actual words in any case we must reconstitute another discourse rediscover the silent murmuring the inexhaustible speech that animates from within the voice that one hears reestablish the tiny invisible text that runs between and sometimes collides with them The analysis of thought is always allegorical in relation to the discourse that it employs Its question is unfailingly what was being said in what was said The analysis of the discursive field is orientated in a quite different way we must grasp the statement in the exact specificity of its occurrence determine its conditions of existence fix at least its limits establish its correlations with other statements that  31 may be connected with it and show what other forms of statement it excludes We do not seek below what is manifest the half silent murmur of another discourse we must show why it could not be other than it was in what respect it is exclusive of any other how it assumes in the midst of others and in relation to them a place that no other could occupy The question proper to such an analysis might be formulated in this way what is this specific existence that emerges from what is said and nowhere else We must ask ourselves what purpose is ultimately served by this suspension of all the accepted unities if in the end we return to the unities that we pretended to question at the outset In fact the systematic erasure of all given unities enables us first of all to restore to the statement the specificity of its occurrence and to show that discontinuity is one of those great accidents that create cracks not only in the geology of history but also in the simple fact of the statement it emerges in its historical irruption what we try to examine is the incision that it makes that irreducible  and very often tiny  emergence However banal it may be however unimportant its consequences may appear to be however quickly it may be forgotten after its appearance however little heard or however badly deciphered we may suppose it to be a statement is always an event that neither the language langue nor the meaning can quite exhaust It is certainly a strange event first because on the one hand it is linked to the gesture of writing or to the articulation of speech and also on the other hand it opens up to itself a residual existence in the field of a memory or in the materiality of manuscripts books or any other form of recording secondly because like every event it is unique yet subject to repetition transformation and reactivation thirdly because it is linked not only to the situations that provoke it and to the consequences that it gives rise to but at the same time and in accordance with a quite different modality to the statements that precede and follow it But if we isolate in relation to the language and to thought the occurrence of the statementevent it is not in order to spread over everything a dust of facts It is in order to be sure that this occurrence is not linked with synthesizing operations of a purely psychological kind the intention of the author the form of his mind the rigour of his thought the themes that obsess him the project that traverses his   32 existence and gives it meaning and to be able to grasp other forms of regularity other types of relations Relations between statements even if the author is unaware of them even if the statements do not have the same author even if the authors were unaware of each others existence  relations between groups of statements thus established even if these groups do not concern the same or even adjacent fields even if they do not possess the same formal level even if they are not the locus of assignable exchanges relations between statements and groups of statements and events of a quite different kind technical economic social political To reveal in all its purity the space in which discursive events are deployed is not to undertake to reestablish it in an isolation that nothing could overcome it is not to close it upon itself it is to leave oneself free to describe the interplay of relations within it and outside it The third purpose of such a description of the facts of discourse is that by freeing them of all the groupings that purport to be natural immediate universal unities one is able to describe other unities but this time by means of a group of controlled decisions Providing one defines the conditions clearly it might be legitimate to constitute on the basis of correctly described relations discursive groups that are not arbitrary and yet remain invisible Of course these relations would never be formulated for themselves in the statements in question unlike for example those explicit relations that are posed and spoken in discourse itself as in the form of the novel or a series of mathematical theorems But in no way would they constitute a sort of secret discourse animating the manifest discourse from within it is not therefore an interpretation of the facts of the statement that might reveal them but the analysis of their coexistence their succession their mutual functioning their reciprocal determination and their independent or correlative transformation However it is not possible to describe all the relations that may emerge in this way without some guidelines A provisional division must be adopted as an initial approximation an initial region that analysis will subsequently demolish and if necessary reorganize But how is such a region to be circumscribed On the one hand we must choose empirically a field in which the relations are likely to be numerous dense and relatively easy to describe and in what other 33 region do discursive events appear to be more closely linked to one another to occur in accordance with more easily decipherable relations than in the region usually known as science But on the other hand what better way of grasping in a statement not the moment of its formal structure and laws of construction but that of its existence and the rules that govern its appearance if not by dealing with relatively unformalized groups of discourses in which the statements do not seem necessarily to be built on the rules of pure syntax How can we be sure of avoiding such divisions as the cruvre or such categories as influence unless from the very outset we adopt sufficiently broad fields and scales that are chronologically vast enough Lastly how can we be sure that we will not find ourselves in the grip of all those overhasty unities or syntheses concerning the speaking subject or the author of the text in short all anthropological categories Unless perhaps we consider all the statements out of which these categories are constituted  all the statements that have chosen the subject of discourse their own subject as their object and have undertaken to deploy it as their field of knowledge This explains the de facto privilege that I have accorded to those discourses that to put it very schematically define the sciences of man But it is only a provisional privilege Two facts must be constantly borne in mind that the analysis of discursive events is in no way limited to such a field and that the division of this field itself cannot be regarded either as definitive or as absolutely valid it is no more than an initial approximation that must allow relations to appear that may erase the limits of this initial outline  34 2 DISCURSIVE FORMATIONS I have undertaken then to describe the relations between statements I have been careful to accept as valid none of the unities that would normally present themselves to anyone embarking on such a task I have decided to ignore no form of discontinuity break threshold or limit I have decided to describe statements in the field of discourse and the relations of which they are capable As I see it two series of problems arise at the outset the first which I shall leave to one side for the time being and shall return to later concerns the indiscriminate use that I have made of the terms statement event and discourse the second concerns the relations that may legitimately he described between the statements that have been left in their provisional visible grouping There are statements for example that are quite obviously concerned  and have been from a date that is easy enough to determine  with political economy or biology or psychopathology there are others that equally obviously belong to those ageold continuities known as grammar or medicine But what are these unities How can we say that the analysis of headaches carried out by Willis or Charcot belong to the same order of discourse That Pettys inventions are in continuity with Neumanns econometry That the analysis of judgement by the PortRoyal grammarians belongs to the same domain as 35 the discovery of vowel gradations in the IndoEuropean languages What in fact are medicine grammar or political economy Are they merely a retrospective regrouping by which the contemporary sciences deceive themselves as to their own past Are they forms that have become established once and for all and have gone on developing through time Do they conceal other unities And what sort of links can validly be recognized between all these statements that form in such a familiar and insistent way such an enigmatic mass First hypothesis  and the one that at first sight struck me as being the most likely and the most easily proved statements different in form and dispersed in time form a group if they refer to one and the same object Thus statements belonging to psychopathology all seem to refer to an object that emerges in various ways in individual or social experience and which may be called madness But I soon realized that the unity of the object madness does not enable one to individualize a group of statements and to establish between them a relation that is both constant and describable There are two reasons for this It would certainly be a mistake to try to discover what could have been said of madness at a particular time by interrogating the being of madness itself its secret content its silent selfenclosed truth mental illness was constituted by all that was said in all the statements that named it divided it up described it explained it traced its developments indicated its various correlations judged it and possibly gave it speech by articulating in its name discourses that were to be taken as its own Moreover this group of statements is far from referring to a single object formed once and for all and to preserving it indefinitely as its horizon of inexhaustible ideality the object presented as their correlative by medical statements of the seventeenth or eighteenth century is not identical with the object that emerges in legal sentences or police action similarly all the objects of psychopathological discourses were modified from Pinel or Esquirol to Bleuler it is not the same illnesses that are at issue in each of these cases we are not dealing with the same madmen One might perhaps one should conclude from this multiplicity of objects that it is not possible to accept as a valid unity forming a group of statements a discourse concerning madness Perhaps one should confine ones attention to those groups of statements that have one and   36 the same object the discourses on melancholia or neurosis for example But one would soon realize that each of these discourses in turn constituted its object and worked it to the point of transforming it altogether So that the problem arises of knowing whether the unity of a discourse is based not so much on the permanence and uniqueness of an object as on the space in which various objects emerge and are continuously transformed Would not the typical relation that would enable us to individualize a group of statements concerning madness then be the rule of simultaneous or successive emergence of the various objects that are named described analysed appreciated or judged in that relation The unity of discourses on madness would not be based upon the existence of the object madness or the constitution of a single horizon of objectivity it would be the interplay of the rules that make possible the appearance of objects during a given period of time objects that are shaped by measures of discrimination and repression objects that are differentiated in daily practice in law in religious casuistry in medical diagnosis objects that are manifested in pathological descriptions objects that are circumscribed by medical codes practices treatment and care Moreover the unity of the discourses on madness would be the interplay of the rules that define the transformations of these different objects their nonidentity through time the break produced in them the internal discontinuity that suspends their permanence Paradoxically to define a group of statements in terms of its individuality would be to define the dispersion of these objects to grasp all the interstices that separate them to measure the distances that reign between them  in other words to formulate their law of division Second hypothesis to define a group of relations between statements their form and type of connexion It seemed to me for example that from the nineteenth century medical science was characterized not so much by its objects or concepts as by a certain style a certain constant manner of statement For the first time medicine no longer consisted of a group of traditions observations and heterogeneous practices but of a corpus of knowledge that presupposed the same way of looking at things the same division of the perceptual field the same analysis of the pathological fact in accordance with the visible space of the body the same system of transcribing what one   37 perceived in what one said same vocabulary same play of metaphor in short it seemed to me that medicine was organized as a series of descriptive statements But there again I had to abandon this hypothesis at the outset and recognize that clinical discourse was just as much a group of hypotheses about life and death of ethical choices of therapeutic decisions of institutional regulations of teaching models as a group of descriptions that the descriptions could not in any case be abstracted from the hypotheses and that the descriptive statement was only one of the formulations present in medical discourse I also had to recognize that this description has constantly been displaced either because from Bichat to cell pathology the scales and guidelines have been displaced or because from visual inspection auscultation and palpation to the use of the microscope and biological tests the information system has been modified or again because from simple anatomoclinical correlation to the delicate analysis of physiopathological processes the lexicon of signs and their decipherment has been entirely reconstituted or finally because the doctor has gradually ceased to be himself the locus of the registering and interpretation of information and because beside him outside him there have appeared masses of documentation instruments of correlation and techniques of analysis which of course he makes use of but which modify his position as an observing subject in relation to the patient All these alterations which may now lead to the threshold of a new medicine gradually appeared in medical discourse throughout the nineteenth century If one wished to define this discourse by a codified and normative system of statement one would have to recognize that this medicine disintegrated as soon as it appeared and that it really found its formulation only in Bichat and Laennec If there is a unity its principle is not therefore a determined form of statements is it not rather the group of rules which simultaneously or in turn have made possible purely perceptual descriptions together with observations mediated through instruments the procedures used in laboratory experiments statistical calculations epidemiological or demographic observations institutional regulations and therapeutic practice What one must characterize and individualize is the coexistence of these dispersed and heterogeneous statements the system that governs their division the degree to which they depend upon one another the way 38 in which they interlock or exclude one another the transformation that they undergo and the play of their location arrangement and replacement Another direction of research another hypothesis might it not be possible to establish groups of statements by determining the system of permanent and coherent concepts involved For example does not the Classical analysis of language and grammatical facts from Lancelot to the end of the eighteenth century rest on a definite number of concepts whose content and usage had been established once and for all the concept of judgement defined as the general normative form of any sentence the concepts of subject and predicate regrouped under the more general category of noun the concept of verb used as the equivalent of that of logical copula the concept of word defined as the sign of a representation etc In this way one might reconstitute the conceptual architecture of Classical grammar But there too one would soon come up against limitations no sooner would one have succeeded in describing with such elements the analyses carried out by the PortRoyal authors than one would no doubt be forced to acknowledge the appearance of new concepts some of these may be derived from the first but the others are heterogeneous and a few even incompatible with them The notion of natural or inverted syntactical order that of complement introduced in the eighteenth century by Beauzee may still no doubt be integrated into the conceptual system of the PortRoyal grammar But neither the idea of an originally expressive value of sounds nor that of a primitive body of knowledge enveloped in words and conveyed in some obscure way by them nor that of regularity in the mutation of consonants nor the notion of the verb as a mere name capable of designating an action or operation is compatible with the group of concepts used by Lancelot or Duclos Must we admit therefore that grammar only appears to form a coherent figure and that this group of statements analyses descriptions principles and consequences deductions that has been perpetrated under this name for over a century is no more than a false unity But perhaps one might discover a discursive unity if one sought it not in the coherence of concepts but in their simultaneous or successive emergence in the distance that separates them and even in their incompatibility One would no longer seek an architecture of concepts sufficiently general 39 and abstract to embrace all others and to introduce them into the same deductive structure one would try to analyse the interplay of their appearances and dispersion Lastly a fourth hypothesis to regroup the statements describe their interconnexion and account for the unitary forms under which they are presented the identity and persistence of themes In sciences like economics or biology which are so controversial in character so open to philosophical or ethical options so exposed in certain cases to political manipulation it is legitimate in the first instance to suppose that a certain thematic is capable of linking and animating a group of discourses like an organism with its own needs its own internal force and its own capacity for survival Could one not for example constitute as a unity everything that has constituted the evolutionist theme from Buffon to Darwin A theme that in the first instance was more philosophical closer to cosmology than to biology a theme that directed research from afar rather than named regrouped and explained results a theme that always presupposed more than one was aware of but which on the basis of this fundamental choice forcibly transformed into discursive knowledge what had been outlined as a hypothesis or as a necessity Could one not speak of the Physiocratic theme in the same way An idea that postulated beyond all demonstration and prior to all analysis the natural character of the three ground rents which consequently presupposed the economic and political primacy of agrarian property which excluded all analysis of the mechanisms of industrial production which implied on the other hand the description of the circulation of money within a state of its distribution between different social categories and of the channels by which it flowed back into production which finally led Ricardo to consider those cases in which this triple rent did not appear the conditions in which it could form and consequently to denounce the arbitrariness of the Physiocratic theme But on the basis of such an attempt one is led to make two inverse and complementary observations In one case the same thematic is articulated on the basis of two sets of concepts two types of analysis two perfectly different fields of objects in its most general formulation the evolutionist idea is perhaps the same in the work of Benoit de Maillet Borden or Diderot and in that of Darwin but in fact what  40 makes it possible and coherent is not at all the same thing in either case In the eighteenth century the evolutionist idea is defined on the basis of a kinship of species forming a continuum laid down at the outset interrupted only by natural catastrophes or gradually built up by the passing of time In the nineteenth century the evolutionist theme concerns not so much the constitution of a continuous table of species as the description of discontinuous groups and the analysis of the modes of interaction between an organism whose elements are interdependent and an environment that provides its real conditions of life A single theme but based on two types of discourse In the case of Physiocracy on the other hand Quesnays choice rests exactly on the same system of concepts as the opposite opinion held by those that might be called utilitarists At this period the analysis of wealth involved a relatively limited set of concepts that was accepted by all coinage was given the same definition prices were given the same explanation and labour costs were calculated in the same way But on the basis of this single set of concepts there were two ways of explaining the formation of value according to whether it was analysed on the basis of exchange or on that of remuneration for the days work These two possibilities contained within economic theory and in the rules of its set of concepts resulted on the basis of the same elements in two different options It would probably be wrong therefore to seek in the existence of these themes the principles of the individualization of a discourse Should they not be sought rather in the dispersion of the points of choice that the discourse leaves free In the different possibilities that it opens of reanimating already existing themes of arousing opposed strategies of giving way to irreconcilable interests of making it possible with a particular set of concepts to play different games Rather than seeking the permanence of themes images and opinions through time rather than retracing the dialectic of their conflicts in order to individualize groups of statements could one not rather mark out the dispersion of the points of choice and define prior to any option to any thematic preference a field of strategic possibilities I am presented therefore with four attempts four failures  and four successive hypotheses They must now be put to the test Concerning those large groups of statements with which we are so familiar  and  41 which we call medicine economics or grammar  I have asked myself on what their unity could be based On a full tightly packed continuous geographically welldefined field of objects What appeared to me were rather series full of gaps intertwined with one another interplays of differences distances substitutions transformations On a definite normative type of statement I found formulations of levels that were much too different and functions that were much too heterogeneous to be linked together and arranged in a single figure and to simulate from one period to another beyond individual oeuvres a sort of great uninterrupted text On a welldefined alphabet of notions One is confronted with concepts that differ in structure and in the rules governing their use which ignore or exclude one another and which cannot enter the unity of a logical architecture On the permanence of a thematic What one finds are rather various strategic possibilities that permit the activation of incompatible themes or again the establishment of the same theme in different groups of statement Hence the idea of describing these dispersions themselves of discovering whether between these elements which are certainly not organized as a progressively deductive structure nor as an enormous book that is being gradually and continuously written nor as the oeuvre of a collective subject one cannot discern a regularity an order in their successive appearance correlations in their simultaneity assignable positions in a common space a reciprocal functioning linked and hierarchized transformations Such an analysis would not try to isolate small islands of coherence in order to describe their internal structure it would not try to suspect and to reveal latent conflicts it would study forms of division Or again instead of reconstituting chains of inference as one often does in the history of the sciences or of philosophy instead of drawing up tables of differences as the linguists do it would describe systems of dispersion Whenever one can describe between a number of statements such a system of dispersion whenever between objects types of statement concepts or thematic choices one can define a regularity an order correlations positions and functionings transformations we will say for the sake of convenience that we are dealing with a discursive formation  thus avoiding words that are already overladen with conditions and consequences and in any case inadequate to the task of designating   42 such a dispersion such as science ideology theory or domain of objectivity The conditions to which the elements of this division objects mode of statement concepts thematic choices are subjected we shall call the rules of formation The rules of formation are conditions of existence but also of coexistence maintenance modification and disappearance in a given discursive division This then is the field to be covered these the notions that we must put to the test and the analyses that we must carry out I am well aware that the risks are considerable For an initial probe I made use of certain fairly loose but familiar groups of statement I have no proof that I shall find them again at the end of the analysis nor that I shall discover the principle of their delimitation and individualization I am not sure that the discursive formations that I shall isolate will define medicine in its overall unity or economics and grammar in the overall curve of their historical destination they may even introduce unexpected boundaries and divisions Similarly I have no proof that such a description will be able to take account of the scientificity or nonscientificity of the discursive groups that I have taken as an attack point and which presented themselves at the outset with a certain pretension to scientific rationality I have no proof that my analysis will not be situated at a quite different level constituting a description that is irreducible to epistemology or to the history of the sciences Moreover at the end of such an enterprise one may not recover those unities that out of methodological rigour one initially held in suspense one may be compelled to dissociate certain euvres ignore influences and traditions abandon definitively the question of origin allow the commanding presence of authors to fade into the background and thus everything that was thought to be proper to the history of ideas may disappear from view The danger in short is that instead of providing a basis for what already exists instead of going over with bold strokes lines that have already been sketched instead of finding reassurance in this return and final confirmation instead of completing the blessed circle that announces after innumerable stratagems and as many nights that all is saved one is forced to advance beyond familiar territory far from the certainties to which one is accustomed towards an as yet uncharted land and unforeseeable conclusion Is there not a danger that everything that has so far protected the historian in his daily   43 journey and accompanied him until nightfall the destiny of rationality and the teleology of the sciences the long continuous labour of thought from period to period the awakening and the progress of consciousness its perpetual resumption of itself the uncompleted but uninterrupted movement of totalizations the return to an everopen source and finally the historicotranscendental thematic may disappear leaving for analysis a blank indifferent space lacking in both interiority and promise  44 3 THE FORMATION OF OBJECTS We must now list the various directions that lie open to us and see whether this notion of rules of formation  of which little more than a rough sketch has so far been provided  can be given real content Let us look first at the formation of objects And in order to facilitate our analysis let us take as an example the discourse of psychopathology from the nineteenth century onwards  a chronological break that is easy enough to accept in a first approach to the subject There are enough signs to indicate it but let us take just two of these the establishment at the beginning of the century of a new mode of exclusion and confinement of the madman in a psychiatric hospital and the possibility of tracing certain presentday notions back to Esquirol Heinroth or Pinel paranoia can be traced back to monomania the intelligence quotient to the initial notion of imbecility general paralysis to chronic encephalitis character neurosis to nondelirious madness whereas if we try to trace the development of psychopathology beyond the nineteenth century we soon lose our way the path becomes confused and the projection of Du Laurens or even Van Swieten on the pathology of Kraepelin or Bleuler provides no more than chance coincidences The objects with which psychopathology has dealt since this break in time are very numerous mostly very new but also very precarious subject to change and in some cases to rapid 45 disappearance in addition to motor disturbances hallucinations and speech disorders which were already regarded as manifestations of madness although they were recognized delimited described and analysed in a different way objects appeared that belonged to hitherto unused registers minor behavioural disorders sexual aberrations and disturbances the phenomena of suggestion and hypnosis lesions of the central nervous system deficiencies of intellectual or motor adaptation criminality And on the basis of each of these registers a variety of objects were named circumstances scribed analysed then rectified redefined challenged erased Is it possible to lay down the rule to which their appearance was subject Is it possible to discover according to which nondeductive system these objects could be juxtaposed and placed in succession to form the fragmented field  showing at certain points great gaps at others a plethora of information  of psychopathology What has ruled their existence as objects of discourse  a First we must map the first surfaces of their emergence show where these individual differences which according to the degrees of rationalization conceptual codes and types of theory will be accorded the status of disease alienation anomaly dementia neurosis or psychosis degeneration etc may emerge and then be designated and analysed These surfaces of emergence are not the same for different societies at different periods and in different forms of discourse In the case of nineteenthcentury psychopathology they were probably constituted by the family the immediate social group the work situation the religious community which are all normative which are all susceptible to deviation which all have a margin of tolerance and a threshold beyond which exclusion is demanded which all have a mode of designation and a mode of rejecting madness which all transfer to medicine if not the responsibility for treatment and cure at least the burden of explanation although organized according to a specific mode these surfaces of emergence were not new in the nineteenth century On the other hand it was no doubt at this period that new surfaces of appearance began to function art with its own normativity sexuality its deviations in relation to customary prohibitions become for the first time an object of observation description and analysis for psychiatric   46 discourse penality whereas in previous periods madness was carefully distinguished from criminal conduct and was regarded as an excuse criminality itself becomes  and subsequent to the celebrated homicidal monomanias  a form of deviance more or less related to madness In these fields of initial differentiation in the distances the discontinuities and the thresholds that appear within it psychiatric discourse finds a way of limiting its domain of defining what it is talking about of giving it the status of an object  and therefore of making it manifest nameable and describable  bWe must also describe the authorities of delimitation in the nineteenth century medicine as an institution possessing its own rules as a group of individuals constituting the medical profession as a body of knowledge and practice as an authority recognized by public opinion the law and government became the major authority in society that delimited designated named and established madness as an object but it was not alone in this the law and penal law in particular with the definitions of excuse nonresponsibility extenuating circumstances and with the application of such notions as the crime passionel heredity danger to society the religious authority in so far as it set itself up as the authority that divided the mystical from the pathological the spiritual from the corporeal the supernatural from the abnormal and in so far as it practised the direction of conscience with a view to understanding individuals rather than carrying out a casuistical classification of actions and circumstances literary and art criticism which in the nineteenth century treated the work less and less as an object of taste that had to be judged and more and more as a language that had to be interpreted and in which the authors tricks of expression had to be recognized cLastly we must analyse the grids of specification these are the systems according to which the different kinds of madness are divided contrasted related regrouped classified derived from one another as objects of psychiatric discourse in the nineteenth century these grids of differentiation were the soul as a group of hierarchized related and more or less interpenetrable faculties the body as a threedimensional volume of organs linked together by networks of   47 dependence and communication the life and history of individuals as a linear succession of phases a tangle of traces a group of potential reactivations cyclical repetitions the interplays of neuropsychological correlations as systems of reciprocal projections and as a field of circular causality  Such a description is still in itself inadequate And for two reasons These planes of emergence authorities of delimitation or forms of specification do not provide objects fully formed and armed that the discourse of psychopathology has then merely to list classify name select and cover with a network of words and sentences it is not the families  with their norms their prohibitions their sensitivity thresholds  that decide who is mad and present the patients to the psychiatrists for analysis and judgement it is not the legal system itself that hands over certain criminals to psychiatry that sees paranoia beyond a particular murder or a neurosis behind a sexual offence It would be quite wrong to see discourse as a place where previously established objects are laid one after another like words on a page But the above enumeration is inadequate for a second reason It has located one after another several planes of differentiation in which the objects of discourse may appear But what relations exist between them Why this enumeration rather than another What defined and closed group does one imagine one is circumscribing in this way And how can one speak of a system of formation if one knows only a series of different heterogeneous determinations lacking attributable links and relations In fact these two series of questions refer back to the same point In order to locate that point let us reexamine the previous example In the sphere with which psychopathology dealt in the nineteenth century one sees the very early appearance as early as Esquirol of a whole series of objects belonging to the category of delinquency homicide and suicide crimes passionels sexual offences certain forms of theft vagrancy  and then through them heredity the neurogenic environment aggressive or selfpunishing behaviour perversions criminal impulses suggestibility etc It would be inadequate to say that one was dealing here with the consequences of a discovery of the sudden discovery by a psychiatrist of a resemblance between criminal and pathological behaviour a discovery of the presence in certain   48 delinquents of the classical signs of alienation or mental derangement Such facts lie beyond the grasp of contemporary research indeed the problem is how to decide what made them possible and how these discoveries could lead to others that took them up rectified them modified them or even disproved them Similarly it would he irrelevant to attribute the appearance of these new objects to the norms of nineteenthcentury bourgeois society to a reinforced police and penal framework to the establishment of a new code of criminal justice to the introduction and use of extenuating circumstances to the increase in crime No doubt all these processes were at work but they could not of themselves form objects for psychiatric discourse to pursue the description at this level one would fall short of what one was seeking If in a particular period in the history of our society the delinquent was psychologized and pathologized if criminal behaviour could give rise to a whole series of objects of knowledge this was because a group of particular relations was adopted for use in psychiatric discourse The relation between planes of specification like penal categories and degrees of diminished responsibility and planes of psychological characterization faculties aptitudes degrees of development or involution different ways of reacting to the environment character types whether acquired innate or hereditary The relation between the authority of medical decision and the authority of judicial decision a really complex relation since medical decision recognizes absolutely the authority of the judiciary to define crime to determine the circumstances in which it is committed and the punishment that it deserves but reserves the right to analyse its origin and to determine the degree of responsibility involved The relation between the filter formed by judicial interrogation police information investigation and the whole machinery of judicial information and the filter formed by the medical questionnaire clinical examinations the search for antecedents and biographical accounts The relation between the family sexual and penal norms of the behaviour of individuals and the table of pathological symptoms and diseases of which they are the signs The relation between therapeutic confinement in hospital with its own thresholds its criteria of cure its way of distinguishing the normal from the pathological and punitive confinement in prison with its system of punishment and pedagogy its criteria of good conduct improvement   49 and freedom These are the relations that operating in psychiatric discourse have made possible the formation of a whole group of various objects Let us generalize in the nineteenth century psychiatric discourse is characterized not by privileged objects but by the way in which it forms objects that are in fact highly dispersed This formation is made possible by a group of relations established between authorities of emergence delimitation and specification One might say then that a discursive formation is defined as far as its objects are concerned at least if one can establish such a group if one can show how any particular object of discourse finds in it its place and law of emergence if one can show that it may give birth simultaneously or successively to mutually exclusive objects without having to modify itself Hence a certain number of remarks and consequences  1The conditions necessary for the appearance of an object of discourse the historical conditions required if one is to say anything about it and if several people are to say different things about it the conditions necessary if it is to exist in relation to other objects if it is to establish with them relations of resemblance proximity distance difference transformation  as we can see these conditions are many and imposing Which means that one cannot speak of anything at any time it is not easy to say something new it is not enough for us to open our eyes to pay attention or to be aware for new objects suddenly to light up and emerge out of the ground But this difficulty is not only a negative one it must not be attached to some obstacle whose power appears to be exclusively to blind to hinder to prevent discovery to conceal the purity of the evidence or the dumb obstinacy of the things themselves the object does not await in limbo the order that will free it and enable it to become embodied in a visible and prolix objectivity it does not preexist itself held back by some obstacle at the first edges of light It exists under the positive conditions of a complex group of relations  2These relations are established between institutions economic and social processes behavioural patterns systems of norms techniques types of classification modes of characterization and these   50 relations are not present in the object it is not they that are deployed when the object is being analysed they do not indicate the web the immanent rationality that ideal nervure that reappears totally or in part when one conceives of the object in the truth of its concept They do not define its internal constitution but what enables it to appear to juxtapose itself with other objects to situate itself in relation to them to define its difference its irreducibility and even perhaps its heterogeneity in short to be placed in a field of exteriority  3These relations must be distinguished first from what we might call primary relations and which independently of all discourse or all object of discourse may be described between institutions techniques social forms etc After all we know very well that relations existed between the bourgeois family and the functioning of judicial authorities and categories in the nineteenth century that can he analysed in their own right They cannot always be superposed upon the relations that go to form objects the relations of dependence that may be assigned to this primary level are not necessarily expressed in the formation of relations that makes discursive objects possible But we must also distinguish the secondary relations that are formulated in discourse itself what for example the psychiatrists of the nineteenth century could say about the relations between the family and criminality does not reproduce as we know the interplay of real dependencies but neither does it reproduce the interplay of relations that make possible and sustain the objects of psychiatric discourse Thus a space unfolds articulated with possible discourses a system of real or primary relations a system of reflexive or secondary relations and a system of relations that might properly be called discursive The problem is to reveal the specificity of these discursive relations and their interplay with the other two kinds  4Discursive relations are not as we can see internal to discourse they do not connect concepts or words with one another they do not establish a deductive or rhetorical structure between propositions or sentences Yet they are not relations exterior to discourse relations that might limit it or impose certain forms upon it or force it in certain circumstances to state certain things They are in a sense at the limit   51 of discourse they offer it objects of which it can speak or rather for this image of offering presupposes that objects are formed independently of discourse they determine the group of relations that discourse must establish in order to speak of this or that object in order to deal with them name them analyse them classify them explain them etc These relations characterize not the language langue used by discourse nor the circumstances in which it is deployed but discourse itself as a practice  We can now complete the analysis and see to what extent it fulfils and to what extent it modifies the initial project Taking those group figures which in an insistent but confused way presented themselves as psychology economics grammar medicine we asked on what kind of unity they could be based were they simply a reconstruction after the event based on particular works successive theories notions and themes some of which had been abandoned others maintained by tradition and again others fated to fall into oblivion only to be revived at a later date Were they simply a series of linked enterprises We sought the unity of discourse in the objects themselves in their distribution in the interplay of their differences in their proximity or distance  in short in what is given to the speaking subject and in the end we are sent back to a settingup of relations that characterizes discursive practice itself and what we discover is neither a configuration nor a form but a group of rules that are immanent in a practice and define it in its specificity We also used as a point of reference a unity like psychopathology if we had wanted to provide it with a date of birth and precise limits it would no doubt have been necessary to discover when the word was first used to what kind of analysis it could be applied and how it achieved its separation from neurology on the one hand and psychology on the other What has emerged is a unity of another type which does not appear to have the same dates or the same surface or the same articulations but which may take account of a group of objects for which the term psychopathology was merely a reflexive secondary classificatory rubric Psychopathology finally emerged as a discipline in a constant state of renewal subject to constant discoveries criticisms and corrected errors the system of   52 formation that we have defined remains stable But let there be no misunderstanding it is not the objects that remain constant nor the domain that they form it is not even their point of emergence or their mode of characterization but the relation between the surfaces on which they appear on which they can be delimited on which they can be analysed and specified In the descriptions for which I have attempted to provide a theory there can be no question of interpreting discourse with a view to writing a history of the referent In the example chosen we are not trying to find out who was mad at a particular period or in what his madness consisted or whether his disturbances were identical with those known to us today We are not asking ourselves whether witches were unrecognized and presecuted madmen and madwomen or whether at a different period a mystical or aesthetic experience was not unduly medicalized We are not trying to reconstitute what madness itself might be in the form in which it first presented itself to some primitive fundamental deaf scarcely articulated experience and in the form in which it was later organized translated deformed travestied perhaps even repressed by discourses and the oblique often twisted play of their operations Such a history of the referent is no doubt possible and I have no wish at the outset to exclude any effort to uncover and free these prediscursive experiences from the tyranny of the text But what we are concerned with here is not to neutralize discourse to make it the sign of something else and to pierce through its density in order to reach what remains silently anterior to it but on the contrary to maintain it in its consistency to make it emerge in its own complexity What in short we wish to do is to dispense with things To depresentify them To conjure up their rich heavy immediate plenitude which we usually regard as the primitive law of a discourse that has become divorced from it through error oblivion illusion ignorance or the inertia of beliefs and traditions or even the perhaps unconscious desire not to see and not to speak To substitute for the enigmatic treasure of things anterior to discourse the regular formation of objects that emerge only in  footnote   This is written against an explicit theme of my book Madness and Civilization and one that recurs particularly in the preface 53   discourse To define these objects without reference to the ground the foundation of things but by relating them to the body of rules that enable them to form as objects of a discourse and thus constitute the conditions of their historical appearance To write a history of discursive objects that does not plunge them into the common depth of a primal soil but deploys the nexus of regularities that govern their dispersion However to suppress the stage of things themselves is not necessarily to return to the linguistic analysis of meaning When one describes the formation of the objects of a discourse one tries to locate the relations that characterize a discursive practice one determines neither a lexical organization nor the scansions of a semantic field one does not question the meaning given at a particular period to such words as melancholia or madness without delirium nor the opposition of content between psychosis and neurosis Not I repeat that such analyses are regarded as illegitimate or impossible but they are not relevant when we are trying to discover for example how criminality could become an object of medical expertise or sexual deviation a possible object of psychiatric discourse The analysis of lexical contents defines either the elements of meaning at the disposal of speaking subjects in a given period or the semantic structure that appears on the surface of a discourse that has already been spoken it does not concern discursive practice as a place in which a tangled plurality  at once superposed and incomplete  of objects is formed and deformed appears and disappears The sagacity of the commentators is not mistaken from the kind of analysis that I have undertaken words are as deliberately absent as things themselves any description of a vocabulary is as lacking as any reference to the living plenitude of experience We shall not return to the state anterior to discourse  in which nothing has yet been said and in which things are only just beginning to emerge out of the grey light and we shall not pass beyond discourse in order to rediscover the forms that it has created and left behind it we shall remain or try to remain at the level of discourse itself Since it is sometimes necessary to dot the is of even the most obvious absences I will say that in all these searches in which I have still progressed so little I would like to show that discourses in the form in which they can he heard or read are not as one might expect a mere intersection of things and words an   54   obscure web of things and a manifest visible coloured chain of words I would like to show that discourse is not a slender surface of contact or confrontation between a reality and a language longue the intrication of a lexicon and an experience I would like to show with precise examples that in analysing discourses themselves one sees the loosening of the embrace apparently so tight of words and things and the emergence of a group of rules proper to discursive practice These rules define not the dumb existence of a reality nor the canonical use of a vocabulary but the ordering of objects Words and things is the entirely serious title of a problem it is the ironic title of a work that modifies its own form displaces its own data and reveals at the end of the day a quite different task A task that consists of not  of no longer  treating discourses as groups of signs signifying elements referring to contents or representations but as practices that systematically form the objects of which they speak Of course discourses are composed of signs but what they do is more than use these signs to designate things It is this more that renders them irreducible to the language longue and to speech It is this more that we must reveal and describe   55 4 THE FORMATION OF ENUNCIATIVE MODALITIES Qualitative descriptions biographical accounts the location interpretation and crosschecking of signs reasonings by analogy deduction statistical calculations experimental verifications and many other forms of statement are to be found in the discourse of nineteenthcentury doctors What is it that links them together What necessity binds them together Why these and not others Before attempting an answer to such questions we must first discover the law operating behind all these diverse statements and the place from which they come  a First question who is speaking Who among the totality of speaking individuals is accorded the right to use this sort of language langage Who is qualified to do so Who derives from it his own special quality his prestige and from whom in return does he receive if not the assurance at least the presumption that what he says is true What is the status of the individuals who  alone  have the right sanctioned by law or tradition juridically defined or spontaneously accepted to proffer such a discourse The status of doctor involves criteria of competence and knowledge institutions systems   56 pedagogic norms legal conditions that give the right  though not without laying down certain limitations  to practise and to extend ones knowledge It also involves a system of differentiation and relations the division of attributions hierarchical subordination functional complementarity the request for and the provision and exchange of information with other individuals or other groups that also possess their own status with the state and its representatives with the judiciary with different professional bodies with religious groups and at times with priests It also involves a number of characteristics that define its functioning in relation to society as a whole the role that is attributed to the doctor according to whether he is consulted by a private person or summoned more or less under compulsion by society according to whether he practises a profession or carries out a function the right to intervene or make decisions that is accorded him in these different cases what is required of him as the supervisor guardian and guarantor of the health of a population a group a family an individual the payment that he receives from the community or from individuals the form of contract explicit or implicit that he negotiates either with the group in which he practises or with the authority that entrusts him with a task or with the patient who requests advice treatment or cure This status of the doctor is generally a rather special one in all forms of society and civilization he is hardly ever an undifferentiated or interchangeable person Medical statements cannot come from anybody their value efficacy even their therapeutic powers and generally speaking their existence as medical statements cannot be dissociated from the statutorily defined person who has the right to make them and to claim for them the power to overcome suffering and death But we also know that this status in western civilization was profoundly modified at the end of the eighteenth century when the health of the population became one of the economic norms required by industrial societies  b We must also describe the institutional sites from which the doctor makes his discourse and from which this discourse derives its legitimate source and point of application its specific objects and instruments of verification In our societies these sites are the hospital a place of constant coded systematic observation run by a   57 differentiated and hierarchized medical staff thus constituting a quantifiable field of frequencies private practice which offers a field of less systematic less complete and far less numerous observations but which sometimes facilitates observations that are more farreaching in their effects with a better knowledge of the background and environment the laboratory an autonomous place long distinct from the hospital where certain truths of a general kind concerning the human body life disease lesions etc which provide certain elements of the diagnosis certain signs of the developing condition certain criteria of cure and which makes therapeutic experiment possible lastly what might be called the library or documentary field which includes not only the hooks and treatises traditionally recognized as valid but also all the observations and casehistories published and transmitted and the mass of statistical information concerning the social environment climate epidemics mortality rates the incidence of diseases the centres of contagion occupational diseases that can be supplied to the doctor by public bodies by other doctors by sociologists and by geographers In this respect too these various sites of medical discourse were profoundly modified in the nineteenth century the importance of the document continues to increase proportionately diminishing the authority of the book or tradition the hospital which had been merely a subsidiary site for discourse on diseases and which took second place in importance and value to private practice in which diseases left in their natural environment were in the eighteenth century to reveal themselves in their vegetal truth then becomes the site of systematic homogeneous observations largescale confrontations the establishment of frequencies and probabilities the annulation of individual variants in short the site of the appearance of disease not as a particular species deploying its essential features beneath the doctors gaze but as an average process with its significant guidelines boundaries and potential development Similarly it was in the nineteenth century that daily medical practice integrated the laboratory as the site of a discourse that has the same experimental norms as physics chemistry or biology  c The positions of the subject are also defined by the situation that it is possible for him to occupy in relation to the various domains or   58 groups of objects according to a certain grid of explicit or implicit interrogations he is the questioning subject and according to a certain programme of information he is the listening subject according to a table of characteristic features he is the seeing subject and according to a descriptive type the observing subject he is situated at an optimal perceptual distance whose boundaries delimit the wheat of relevant information he uses instrumental intermediaries that modify the scale of the information shift the subject in relation to the average or immediate perceptual level ensure his movement from a superficial to a deep level make him circulate in the interior space of the body  from manifest symptoms to the organs from the organs to the tissues and finally from the tissues to the cells To these perceptual situations should be added the positions that the subject can occupy in the information networks in theoretical teaching or in hospital training in the system of oral communication or of written document as emitter and receiver of observations casehistories statistical data general theoretical propositions projects and decisions The various situations that the subject of medical discourse may occupy were redefined at the beginning of the nineteenth century with the organization of a quite different perceptual field arranged in depth manifested by successive recourse to instruments deployed by surgical techniques or methods of autopsy centred upon lesional sites and with the establishment of new systems of registration notation description classification integration in numerical series and in statistics with the introduction of new forms of teaching the circulation of information relations with other theoretical domains sciences or philosophy and with other institutions whether administrative political or economic  If in clinical discourse the doctor is in turn the sovereign direct questioner the observing eye the touching finger the organ that deciphers signs the point at which previously formulated descriptions are integrated the laboratory technician it is because a whole group of relations is involved Relations between the hospital space as a place of assistance of purified systematic observation and of partially proved partially experimental therapeutics and a whole group of perceptual codes of the human body  as it is defined by morbid anatomy relations between the field of immediate observations and the domain   59 of acquired information relations between the doctors therapeutic role his pedagogic role his role as an intermediary in the diffusion of medical knowledge and his role as a responsible representative of public health in the social space Understood as a renewal of points of view contents the forms and even the style of description the use of inductive or probabilistic reasoning types of attribution of causality in short as a renewal of the modalities of enunciation clinical medicine must not be regarded as the result of a new technique of observation  that of autopsy which was practised long before the advent of the nineteenth century nor as the result of the search for pathogenic causes in the depths of the organism  Morgagni was engaged in such a search in the middle of the eighteenth century nor as the effect of that new institution the teaching hospital  such institutions had already been in existence for some decades in Austria and Italy nor as the result of the introduction of the concept of tissue in Bichats Traite des membranes But as the establishment of a relation in medical discourse between a number of distinct elements some of which concerned the status of doctors others the institutional and technical site form which they spoke others their position as subjects perceiving observing describing teaching etc It can be said that this relation between different elements some of which are new while others were already in existence is effected by clinical discourse it is this as a practice that establishes between them all a system of relations that is not really given or constituted a priori and if there is a unity if the modalities of enunciation that it uses or to which it gives place are not simply juxtaposed by a series of historical contingencies it is because it makes constant use of this group of relations One further remark Having noted the disparity of the types of enunciation in clinical discourse I have not tried to reduce it by uncovering the formal structures categories modes of logical succession types of reasoning and induction forms of analysis and synthesis that may have operated in a discourse I did not wish to reveal the rational organization that may provide statements like those of medicine with their element of intrinsic necessity Nor did I wish to reduce to a single founding act or to a founding consciousness the general horizon of rationality against which the progress of medicine gradually emerged its efforts to model itself upon the exact sciences the   60 contraction of its methods of observation the slow difficult expulsion of the images or fantasies that inhabit it the purification of its system of reasoning Lastly I have not tried to describe the empirical genesis nor the various component elements of the medical mentality how this shift of interest on the part of the doctors came about by what theoretical or experimental model they were influenced what philosophy or moral thematics defined the climate of their reflexion to what questions to what demands they had to reply what efforts were required of them to free themselves from traditional prejudices by what ways they were led towards a unification and coherence that were never achieved never reached by their knowledge In short I do not refer the various enunciative modalities to the unity of the subject  whether it concerns the subject regarded as the pure founding authority of rationality or the subject regarded as an empirical function of synthesis Neither the knowing le connaitre nor the knowledge les connaissances In the proposed analysis instead of referring back to the synthesis or the unifying function of a subject the various enunciative modalities manifest his dispersion To the various statuses the various sites the various sites the various positions that he can occupy or be given when making a discourse To the discontinuity of the planes from which he speaks And if these planes are linked by a system of relations this system is not established by the synthetic activity of a consciousness identical with itself dumb and anterior to all speech but by the specificity of a discursive practice I shall abandon any attempt therefore to see discourse as a phenomenon of expression  the verbal translation of a previously established synthesis instead I shall look for a field of regularity for various positions of subjectivity Thus conceived discourse is not the majestically unfolding manifestation of a thinking knowing speaking subject but on the contrary a totality in which the dispersion of the subject and his discontinuity with himself may be determined It is a space of exteriority in which a network of distinct sites is deployed I showed earlier that it was neither by words nor by things that the regulation of the objects proper to a discursive   footnote In this respect the term regard medical used in my Naissance de In Clinique was not a very happy one 61   formation should be defined similarly it must now be recognized that it is neither by recourse to a transcendental subject nor by recourse to a psychological subjectivity that the regulation of its enunciations should be defined  62 5 THE FORMATION OF CONCEPTS Perhaps the family of concepts that emerges in the work of Linnaeus hut also in that of Ricardo and in the Grammaire de PortRoyal may be organized into a coherent whole Perhaps one might be able to restore the deductive architecture that it forms In any case the experiment is worth attempting  and it has been attempted several times On the other hand if one takes a broader scale and chooses as guidelines such disciplines as grammar or economics or the study of living beings the set of concepts that emerges does not obey such rigorous conditions their history is not the stonebystone construction of an edifice Should this dispersion be left in its apparent disorder Or should it be seen as a succession of conceptual systems each possessing its own organization and being articulated only against the permanence of problems the continuity of tradition or the mechanism of influences Could a law not be found that would account for the successive or simultaneous emergence of disparate concepts Could a system of occurrence not be found between them that was not a logical systematicity Rather than wishing to replace concepts in a virtual deductive edifice one would have to describe the organization of the field of statements where they appeared and circulated 63 a This organization involves firstly forms of succession And among them the various orderings of enunciative series whether the order of inferences successive implications and demonstrative reasonings or the order of descriptions the schemata of generalization or progressive specification to which they are subject the spatial distributions that they cover or the order of the descriptive accounts and the way in which the events of the time are distributed in the linear succession of the statements the various types of dependence of the statements which are not always either identical or superposable on the manifest successions of the series of statements this is the case in the dependences of hypothesisverification assertioncritique general lawparticular application the various rhetorical schemata according to which groups of statements may he combined how descriptions deductions definitions whose succession characterizes the architecture of a text are linked together Take for example the case of Natural History in the Classical period it does not use the same concepts as in the sixteenth century certain of the older concepts genus species signs are used in different ways new concepts like that of structure appear and others like that of organism are formed later But what was altered in the seventeenth century and was to govern the appearance and recurrence of concepts for the whole of Natural History was the general arrangement of the statements their successive arrangement in particular wholes it was the way in which one wrote down what one observed and by means of a series of statements recreated a perceptual process it was the relation and interplay of subordinations between describing articulating into distinctive features characterizing and classifying it was the reciprocal position of particular observations and general principles it was the system of dependence between what one learnt what one saw what one deduced what one accepted as probable and what one postulated In the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries Natural History was not simply a form of knowledge that gave a new definition to concepts like genus or character and which introduced new concepts like that of natural classification or mammal above all it was a set of rules for arranging statements in series an obligatory set of schemata of dependence of order and of successions in which the recurrent elements that may have value as concepts were distributed   64 b The configuration of the enunciative field also involves forms of coexistence These outline first a field of presence by which is understood all statements formulated elsewhere and taken up in a discourse acknowledged to be truthful involving exact description wellfounded reasoning or necessary presupposition we must also give our attention to those that are criticized discussed and judged as well as those that are rejected or excluded in this field of presence the relations established may be of the order of experimental verification logical validation mere repetition acceptance justified by tradition and authority commentary a search for hidden meanings the analysis of error these relations may be explicit and sometimes formulated in types of specialized statements references critical discussions or implicit and present in ordinary statements Again it is easy to see that the field of presence of Natural History in the Classical period does not obey the same forms or the same criteria of choice or the same principles of exclusion as in the period when Aldrovandi was collecting in one and the same text everything that had been seen observed recounted passed on innumerable times by word of mouth and even imagined by the poets on the subject of monsters Distinct from this field of presence one may also describe a field of concomitance this includes statements that concern quite different domains of objects and belong to quite different domains of objects and belong to quite different types of discourse but which are active among the statements studied here either because they serve as analogical confirmation or because they serve as a general principle and as premises accepted by a reasoning or because they serve as models that can be transferred to other contents or because they function as a higher authority than that to which at least certain propositions are presented and subjected thus the field of concomitance of the Natural History of the period of Linnaeus and Buffon is defined by a number of relations with cosmology the history of the earth philosophy theology scripture and biblical exegesis mathematics in the very general form of a science of order and all these relations distinguish it from both the discourse of the sixteenthcentury naturalists and that of the nineteenthcentury biologists Lastly the enunciative field involves what might be called a field of memory statements that are no longer accepted or discussed and which consequently no longer define either a body of truth or a domain of  65 validity but in relation to which relations of filiation genesis transformation continuity and historical discontinuity can be established thus the field of memory of Natural History since Tournefort seems particularly restricted and impoverished in its forms when compared with the broad cumulative and very specific field of memory possessed by nineteenth and twentiethcentury biology on the other hand it seems much better defined and better articulated than the field of memory surrounding the history of plants and animals in the Renaissance for at that time it could scarcely be distinguished from the field of presence they had the same extension and the same form and involved the same relations  c Lastly we may define the procedures of intervention that may be legitimately applied to statements These procedures are not in fact the same for all discursive formations those that are used to the exclusion of all others the relations that link them and the unity thus created make it possible to specify each one These procedures may appear in techniques of rewriting like those for example that enabled the naturalists of the Classical period to rewrite linear descriptions in classificatory tables that have neither the same laws nor the same configuration as the lists and groups of kinship established in the Middle Ages and during the Renaissance in methods of transcribing statements articulated in the natural language according to a more or less formalized and artificial language the project and to a certain extent the realization of such a language is to be found in Linnaeus and Adanson the modes of translating quantitative statements into qualitative formulations and vice versa the establishment of relations between purely perceptual measurements and descriptions the means used to increase the approximation of statements and to refine their exactitude structural analysis according to the form number arrangement and size of the elements has made it possible since Tournefort to achieve a closer and above all more constant approximation of descriptive statements the way in which one delimits once again  by extension or restriction  the domain of validity of statements the enunciation of structural characters was restricted in the period between Tournefort and Linnaeus then enlarged in that between Buffon and Jussieu the way in which one transfers a type of   66 statement from one field of application to another like the transference from vegetal characterization to animal taxonomy or from the description of superficial characters to the internal elements of the organism the methods of systematizing propositions that already exist because they have been previously formulated but in a separated state or again the methods of redistributing statements that are already linked together but which one rearranges in a new systematic whole as Adanson takes up the natural characterizations that had been made before either by himself or by others and placed them in a group of artificial descriptions the schema of which he had previously worked out on the basis of some abstract combinatory  These elements that I am proposing to analyse are of rather different kinds Some constitute rules of formal construction others rhetorical practices some define the internal configuration of a text others the modes of relation and interference between different texts some are characteristic of a particular period others have a distant origin and farreaching chronological import But what properly belongs to a discursive formation and what makes it possible to delimit the group of concepts disparate as they may be that are specific to it is the way in which these different elements are related to one another the way in which for example the ordering of descriptions or accounts is linked to the techniques of rewriting the way in which the field of memory is linked to the forms of hierarchy and subordination that govern the statements of a text the way in which the modes of approximation and development of the statements are linked to the modes of criticism commentary and interpretation of previously formulated statements etc It is this group of relations that constitutes a system of conceptual formation The description of such a system could not be valid for a direct immediate description of the concepts themselves My intention is not to carry out an exhaustive observation of them to establish the characteristics that they may have in common to undertake a classification of them to measure their internal coherence or to test their mutual compatibility I do not wish to take as an object of analysis the conceptual architecture of an isolated text an individual oeuvre or a science at a particular moment in time One stands back in relation to this manifest   67 set of concepts and one tries to determine according to what schemata of series simultaneous groupings linear or reciprocal modification the statements may be linked to one another in a type of discourse one tries in this way to discover how the recurrent elements of statements can reappear dissociate recompose gain in extension or determination be taken up into new logical structures acquire on the other hand new semantic contents and constitute partial organizations among themselves These schemata make it possible to describe  not the laws of the internal construction of concepts not their progressive and individual genesis in the mind of man  but their anonymous dispersion through texts hooks and oeuvres A dispersion that characterizes a type of discourse and which defines between concepts forms of deduction derivation and coherence but also of incompatibility intersection substitution exclusion mutual alteration displacement etc Such an analysis then concerns at a kind of preconceptual level the field in which concepts can coexist and the rules to which this field is subjected In order to define more precisely what I mean by preconceptual I shall take the example of the four theoretical schemata studied in my book The Order of Things and which characterize General Grammar in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries These four schemata  attribution articulation designation and dervation  do not designate concepts that were in fact used by the Classical grammarians nor do they make it possible to reconstitute over and above different grammatical works a sort of more general more abstract more impoverished system but discover by that very fact the profound compatibility of these different apparently opposed systems They make it possible to describe  1 How the different grammatical analyses can be ordered and deployed and what forms of succession are possible between analyses of the noun analyses of the verb and analyses of the adjective those that concern phonetics and those that concern syntax those that concern the original language longue and those that project an artificial language longue These different orders are laid down by the relations of dependence that may be observed between the theories of attribution articulation designation and derivation   68 2How General Grammar defines a domain of validity for itself according to what criteria one may discuss the truth or falsehood of a proposition how it constitutes a domain of normativity for itself according to what criteria one may exclude certain statements as being irrelevant to the discourse or as inessential and marginal or as nonscientific how it constitutes a domain of actuality for itself comprising acquired solutions defining present problems situating concepts and affirmations that have fallen into disuse  3What relations General Grammar has with Mathesis with Cartesian and postCartesian algebra with the project of a general science of order with the philosophical analysis of representation and the theory of signs with Natural History the problems of characterization and taxonomy with the Analysis of Wealth and the problems of the arbitrary signs of measurement and exchange by marking out these relations one may determine the ways by which the circulation the transfer and the modification of concepts the alteration of their form or changes in their field of application are made possible between one domain and another The network formed by the four theoretical segments does not define the logical architecture of all the concepts used by grammarians it outlines the regular space of their formation  4How the various conceptions of the verb to be of the copula of the verbal radical and the flexional ending for a theoretical schema of attribution were simultaneously or successively possible under the form of alternative choice modification or substitution the various conceptions of the phonetic elements of the alphabet of the name of substantives and adjectives for a theoretical schema of articulation the various concepts of proper noun and common noun demonstrative nominal root syllable or expressive sonority for the theoretical segment of designation the various concepts of original and derived language langage metaphor and figure poetic language langage for the theoretical segment of derivation  The preconceptual level that we have uncovered refers neither to a horizon of ideality nor to an empirical genesis of abstractions On the one hand it is not a horizon of ideality placed discovered or   69 established by a founding gesture  and one that is so original that it eludes all chronological insertion it is not an inexhaustible a priori at the confines of history set back both because it eludes all beginning all genetic restitution and because it could never he contemporary with itself in an explicit totality In fact one does not pose the question at the level of discourse itself which is not external translation but the locus of emergence of concepts one does not attach the constants of discourse to the ideal structures of the concept but one describes the conceptual network on the basis of the intrinsic regularities of discourse one does not subject the multiplicity of statements to the coherence of concepts and this coherence to the silent recollection of a metahistorical ideality one establishes the inverse series one replaces the pure aims of noncontradiction in a complex network of conceptual compatibility and incompatibility and one relates this complexity to the rules that characterize a particular discursive practice By that very fact it is no longer necessary to appeal to the themes of an endlessly withdrawing origin and and inexhaustible horizon the organization of a group of rules in the practice of discourse even if it does not constitute an event so easy to situate as a formulation or a discovery may he determined however in the element of history and if it is inexhaustible it is by that very fact that the perfectly describable system that it constitutes takes account of a very considerable set of concepts and a very large number of transformations that affect both these concepts and their relations Instead of outlining a horizon that rises from the depths of history and maintains itself through history the preconceptual thus described is on the contrary at the most superficial level at the level of discourse the group of rules that in fact operate within it Nor is it a genesis of abstractions trying to rediscover the series of operations that have made it possible to constitute them overall intuitions discoveries of particular cases the disconnexion of imaginary themes the encountering of theoretical or technical obstacles successive borrowings from traditional models definition of the adequate formal structure etc In the analysis proposed here the rules of formation operate not only in the mind or consciousness of individuals but in discourse itself they operate therefore according to a sort of uniform anonymity on all individuals who undertake to speak in this   70 discursive field On the other hand one does not suppose them to be universally valid for every domain one always describes them in particular discursive fields and one does not accord them at the outset indefinite possibilities of extension The most one can do is to make a systematic comparison from one region to another of the rules for the formation of concepts it is in this way that I have tried to uncover the identities and differences that may be presented by these groups of rules in the General Grammar the Natural History and the Analysis of Wealth of the Classical period These groups of rules are specific enough in each of these domains to characterize a particular wellindividualized discursive formation but they offer enough analogies for us to see these various formations form a wider discursive grouping at a higher level In any case the rules governing the formation of concepts however generalized the concepts may be are not the result laid down in history and deposited in the depth of collective customs of operations carried out by individuals they do not constitute the bare schema of a whole obscure work in the course of which concepts would be made to emerge through illusions prejudices errors and traditions The preconceptual field allows the emergence of the discursive regularities and constraints that have made possible the heterogeneous multiplicity of concepts and beyond these the profusion of the themes beliefs and representations with which one usually deals when one is writing the history of ideas In order to analyse the rules for the formation of objects one must neither as we have seen embody them in things nor relate them to the domain of words in order to analyse the formation of enunciative types one must relate them neither to the knowing subject nor to a psychological individuality Similarly to analyse the formation of concepts one must relate them neither to the horizon of ideality nor to the empirical progress of ideas 6 THE FORMATION OF STRATEGIES Such discourses as economics medicine grammar the science of living beings give rise to certain organizations of concepts certain regroupings of objects certain types of enunciation which form according to their degree of coherence rigour and stability themes or theories the theme in eighteenthcentury grammar of an original language longue from which all others derive and of which all others carry within themselves a sometimes decipherable memory a theory in nineteenthcentury philology of a kinship between all the IndoEuropean languages and of an archaic idiom that served as a common startingpoint a theme in the eighteenth century of an evolution of the species deploying in time the continuity of nature and explaining the present gaps in the taxonomic table a theory propounded by the Physiocrats of a circulation of wealth on the basis of agricultural production Whatever their formal level may be I shall call these themes and theories strategies The problem is to discover how they are distributed in history Is it necessity that links them together makes them invisible calls them to their right places one after another and makes of them successive solutions to one and the same problem Or chance encounters between ideas of different origin influences discoveries  72 speculative climates theoretical models that the patience or genius of individuals arranges into more or less wellconstituted wholes Or can one find a regularity between them and define the common system of their formation As for the analysis of these strategies I can hardly enter into great detail The reason is simple enough in the various discursive domains which I have tried to sketch out  rather hesitantly no doubt and especially at the beginning with inadequate methodological control  the problem was to describe in each case the discursive formation in all its dimensions and according to its own characteristics it was necessary therefore to describe each time the rules for the formation of objects modalities of statement concepts and theoretical choices But it turned out that the difficult point of the analysis and the one that demanded greatest attention was not the same in each case In Madness and Civilization I was dealing with a discursive formation whose theoretical points of choice were fairly easy to locate whose conceptual systems were relatively uncomplex and few in number and whose enunciative rules were fairly homogeneous and repetitive on the other hand the problem lay in the emergence of a whole group of highly complex interwoven objects it was necessary above all to describe the formation of these objects in order to locate in its specificity the whole of psychiatric discourse In Naissance de la clinique the essential point of the research was the way in which at the end of the eighteenth and the beginning of the nineteenth century the enunciative forms of medical discourse had been modified the analysis was concerned therefore less with the formation of conceptual systems or the formation of theoretical choices than with the status the institutional siting the situation and the modes of insertion used by the discoursing subject Lastly in The Order of Things my attention was concentrated mainly on the networks of concepts and their rules of formation identical or different as they could be located in General Grammar Natural History and the Analysis of Wealth The place and the implications of the strategic choices were indicated whether for example in the case of Linnaeus and Buffon or the Physiocrats and the Utilitarists but I did little more than locate them and my analysis scarcely touched on their formation Let us say that a fuller analysis of theoretical choices   73 must be left until a later study in which I shall be able to give it my whole attention For the moment the most that I can do is to indicate the directions in which the research will proceed These might be summarized thus  I  Determine the possible points of diffraction of discourse These points are characterized in the first instance as points of incompatibility two objects or two types of enunciation or two concepts may appear in the same discursive formation without being able to enter  under pain of manifest contradiction or inconsequence  the same series of statements They are then characterized as points of equivalence the two incompatible elements are formed in the same way and on the basis of the same rules the conditions of their appearance are identical they are situated at the same level and instead of constituting a mere defect of coherence they form an alternative even if chronologically speaking they do not appear at the same time even if they do not have the same importance and if they were not equally represented in the population of effective statements they appear in the form of either    or Lastly they are characterized as link points of systematization on the basis of each of these equivalent yet incompatible elements a coherent series of objects forms of statement and concepts has been derived with in each series possible new points of incompatibility In other words the dispersions studied at previous levels do not simply constitute gaps nonidentities discontinuous series they come to form discursive subgroups  those very subgroups that are usually regarded as being of major importance as if they were the immediate unity and raw material out of which larger discursive groups theories conceptions themes are formed For example one does not consider in an analysis of this kind that the Analysis of Wealth in the eighteenth century was the result by way of simultaneous composition or chronological succession of several different conceptions of coinage of the exchange of objects of need of the formation of value and prices or of ground rent one does not consider that it is made up of the ideas of Cantillon taking up from those of Petty of Laws experience reflected by various theoreticians in turn and of the Physiocratic system opposing Utilitarist conceptions One describes it rather as a unity of distribution that opens a field of possible options and enables   74 various mutually exclusive architectures to appear side by side or in turn  2 But all the possible alternatives are not in fact realized there are a good many partial groups regional compatibilities and coherent architectures that might have emerged yet did not do so In order to account for the choices that were made out of all those that could have been made and those alone one must describe the specific authorities that guided ones choice Well to the fore is the role played by the discourse being studied in relation to those that are contemporary with it or related to it One must study therefore the economy of the discursive constellation to which it belongs It may in fact play the role of a formal system of which other discourses are applications with various semantic fields it may on the other hand he that of a concrete model that must be applied to other discourses at a higher level of abstraction thus General Grammar in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries appears as a particular model of the general theory of signs and representation The discourse under study may also be in a relation of analogy opposition or complementarity with certain other discourses there is for example a relation of analogy in the Classical period between the Analysis of Wealth and Natural History the first is to the representation of need and desire what the second is to the representation of perceptions and judgements one may also note that Natural History and General Grammar are opposed to one another in the same way as a theory of natural characters and a theory of conventional signs both in turn are opposed to the Analysis of Wealth just as the study of qualitative signs is opposed to that of the quantitative signs of measurement each in fact develops one of the three complementary roles of the representative sign designation classification exchange Lastly one may describe between several discourses relations of mutual delimitation each giving the other the distinctive marks of its singularity by the differentiation of its domain of application as in the case of psychiatry and organic medicine which were virtually not distinguished from one another before the end of the eighteenth century and which established from that moment a gap that has since characterized them This whole group of relations forms a principle of determination that permits or excludes within a given discourse a 75 certain number of statements these are conceptual systematizations enunciative series groups and organizations of objects that might have been possible and of which nothing can justify the absence at the level of their own rules of formation but which are excluded by a discursive constellation at a higher level and in a broader space A discursive formation does not occupy therefore all the possible volume that is opened up to it of right by the systems of formation of its objects its enunciations and its concepts it is essentially incomplete owing to the system of formation of its strategic choices Hence the fact that taken up again placed and interpreted in a new constellation a given discursive formation may reveal new possibilities thus in the present distribution of scientific discourses the Grammar of PortRoyal or the taxonomy of Linnaeus may free elements that in relation to them are both intrinsic and new but we are not dealing with a silent content that has remained implicit that has been said and yet not said and which constitutes beneath manifest statements a sort of subdiscourse that is more fundamental and which is now emerging at last into the light of day what we are dealing with is a modification in the principle of exclusion and the principle of the possibility of choices a modification that is due to an insertion in a new discursive constellation  3 The determination of the theoretical choices that were actually made is also dependent upon another authority This authority is characterized first by the function that the discourse under study must carry out in a field of nondiscursive practices Thus General Grammar played a role in pedagogic practice in a much more obvious and much more important way the Analysis of Wealth played a role not only in the political and economic decisions of governments but in the scarcely conceptualized scarcely theoretized daily practice of emergent capitalism and in the social and political struggles that characterized the Classical period This authority also involves the rules and processes of appropriation of discourse for in our societies and no doubt in many others the property of discourse  in the sense of the right to speak ability to understand licit and immediate access to the corpus of already formulated statements and the capacity to invest this discourse in decisions institutions or practices  is in fact confined sometimes   76 with the addition of legal sanctions to a particular group of individuals in the bourgeois societies that we have known since the sixteenth century economic discourse has never been a common discourse no more than medical or literary discourse though in a different way Lastly this authority is characterized by the possible positions of desire in relation to discourse discourse may in fact be the place for a phantasmatic representation an element of symbolization a form of the forbidden an instrument of derived satisfaction this possibility of being in relation with desire is not simply the fact of the poetic fictional or imaginary practice of discourse the discourses on wealth on language langage on nature on madness on life and death and many others perhaps that are much more abstract may occupy very specific positions in relation to desire In any case the analysis of this authority must show that neither the relation of discourse to desire nor the processes of its appropriation nor its role among nondiscursive practices is extrinsic to its unity its characterization and the laws of its formation They are not disturbing elements which superposing themselves upon its pure neutral atemporal silent form suppress its true voice and emit in its place a travestied discourse but on the contrary its formative elements  A discursive formation will be individualized if one can define the system of formation of the different strategies that are deployed in it in other words if one can show how they all derive in spite of their sometimes extreme diversity and in spite of their dispersion in time from the same set of relations For example the Analysis of Wealth in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries is characterized by the system that could form both Colberts mercantilism and Cantillons neomercantilism Laws strategy and that of ParisDuverney the Physiocratic option and the Utilitarist option And one will have defined this system if one can describe how the points of diffraction of economic discourse derive from one another regulate one another and are involved with one another how a point of choice about prices derives from a decision about the concept of value how the choices made depend on the general constellation in which economic discourse figures the choice in favour of coinagesign is linked to the place occupied by the Analysis of Wealth beside the theory of language langage the   77 analysis of representations mathesis and the science of order  how these choices are linked to the function carried out by economic discourse in the practice of emergent capitalism the process of appropriation of which it is the object on the part of the bourgeoisie the role that it can play in the realization of interests and desires Economic discourse in the Classical period is defined by a certain constant way of relating possibilities of systematization interior to a discourse other discourses that are exterior to it and a whole nondiscursive field of practices appropriation interests and desires It should be noted that the strategies thus described are not rooted anterior to discourse in the silent depths of a choice that is both preliminary and fundamental All these groups of discourses that are to be described are not the expression of a worldview that has been coined in the form of words nor the hypocritical translation of an interest masquerading under the pretext of a theory the Natural History of the Classical period is more than a confrontation in the limbo that precedes manifest history between a Linnaean view of a static ordered compartmented universe that is subjected from its very beginnings to the classificatory table and the still confused perception of a nature that is the heir to time with all the weight of its accidents and open to the possibility of an evolution similarly the Analysis of Wealth is more than the conflict of interest between a bourgeoisie that has become a landowning class expressing its economic or political demands through the Physiocrats and a commercial bourgeoisie that demands protectionist or liberal measures through the Utilitarists Neither the Analysis of Wealth nor Natural History if one questions them at the level of their existence their unity their permanence and their transformations may be regarded as the sum of these various options On the contrary these options must be described as systematically different ways of treating objects of discourse of delimiting them regrouping or separating them linking them together and making them derive from one another of arranging forms of enunciation of choosing them placing them constituting series composing them into great rhetorical unities of manipulating concepts of giving them rules for their use inserting them into regional coherences and thus constituting conceptual architectures These options are not seeds of discourse in which discourses are determined in advance and   78 prefigured in a quasimicroscopic form they are regulated ways and describable as such of practising the possibilities of discourse But these strategies must not be analysed either as secondary elements that are superposed on a discursive rationality that is of right independent of them There is not or at least as far as the historical description whose possibility we are tracing here is concerned a sort of ideal discourse that is both ultimate and timeless and which choices extrinsic in origin have perverted disturbed suppressed or thrust towards a possibly distant future one must not suppose for example that it holds on nature or on the economy two superposed and intermingled discourses one that proceeds slowly accumulating its acquisitions and gradually achieving completion a true discourse but one that exists in its pure state only at the teleological confines of history the other forever disintegrating recommenced in perpetual rupture with itself composed of heterogeneous fragments a discourse of opinion that history in the course of time throws back into the past There is no natural taxonomy that has been exact fixism excepted there is no economy of exchange and use that has been true without the preferences and illusions of a mercantile bourgeoisie Classical taxonomy or the Analysis of Wealth in the form in which they actually existed and constituted historical figures involve in an articulated but indissociable system objects statements concepts and theoretical choices And just as one must not relate the formation of objects either to words or to things nor that of statements either to the pure form of knowledge or to the psychological subject nor that of concepts either to the structure of ideality or to the succession of ideas one must not relate the formation of theoretical choices either to a fundamental project or to the secondary play of opinions   7 REMARKS AND CONSEQUENCES We must now take up once more a number of remarks to be found in the preceding analyses reply to some of the questions that they inevitably raise and above all examine the objection that threatens to present itself for the paradox of the enterprise is now apparent At the outset I questioned those preestablished unities according to which one has traditionally divided up the indefinite repetitive prolific domain of discourse My intention was not to deny all value to these unities or to try to forbid their use it was to show that they required in order to be defined exactly a theoretical elaboration However  and it is here that all the preceding analyses appear so problematic  was it necessary to superpose upon these unities which may in fact have been rather uncertain another category of less visible more abstract and certainly far more problematical unities But in cases when their historical limits and the specificity of their organization are fairly easy to perceive witness General Grammar or Natural History these discursive formations present far more difficult problems of location than the book or the oeuvre Why then proceed to such dubious regroupings at the very moment when one is challenging those that once seemed the most obvious What new domain is one hoping to   80 discover What hitherto obscure or implicit relations What transformations that have hitherto remained outside the reach of historians In short what descriptive efficacy can one accord to these new analyses I shall try to answer all these questions later But for the moment I must reply to a question that is primary in relation to these later analyses and terminal in relation to the preceding ones on the question of the discursive formations that I have tried to define can one really speak of unities Is the redivision that I am proposing capable of individualizing wholes And what is the nature of the unity thus discovered or constructed We set out with an observation with the unity of a discourse like that of clinical medicine or political economy or Natural History we are dealing with a dispersion of elements This dispersion itself  with its gaps its discontinuities its entanglements its incompatibilities its replacements and its substitutions  can be described in its uniqueness if one is able to determine the specific rules in accordance with which its objects statements concepts and theoretical options have been formed if there really is a unity it does not lie in the visible horizontal coherence of the elements formed it resides well anterior to their formation in the system that makes possible and governs that formation But in what way can we speak of unities and systems How can we affirm that we have properly individualized certain discursive groups or wholes When in a highly random way we have uncovered behind the apparently irreducible multiplicity of objects statements concepts and choices a mass of elements that were no less numerous or dispersed but which were heterogeneous with one another When we have divided these elements into four distinct groups whose mode of articulation has scarcely been defined And in what sense can one say that all these elements that have been uncovered behind the objects statements concepts and strategies of discourses guarantee the existence of no less individualizable wholes such as oeuvres or books  1 As we have seen  and there is probably no need to reiterate it  when one speaks of a system of formation one does not only mean the juxtaposition coexistence or interaction of heterogeneous elements institutions techniques social groups perceptual organizations relations between various discourses but also the relation that is   81 established between them  and in a well determined form  by discursive practice But what is to he done with those four systems or rather those four groups of relations How can they all define a single system of formation In fact the different levels thus defined are not independent of one another I have shown that the strategic choices do not emerge directly from a worldview or from a predominance of interests peculiar to this or that speaking subject but that their very possibility is determined by points of divergence in the group of concepts I have also shown that concepts were not formed directly against the approximative confused and living background of ideas but on the basis of forms of coexistence between statements and as we have seen the modalities of enunciation were described on the basis of the position occupied by the subject in relation to the domain of objects of which he is speaking In this way there exists a vertical system of dependences not all the positions of the subject all the types of coexistence between statements all the discursive strategies are equally possible but only those authorized by anterior levels given for example the system of formation that governed in the eighteenth century the objects of Natural History as individualities possessing characters and therefore classifiable as structural elements capable of variation as visible analysable surfaces as a field of continuous regular differences certain modalities of enunciation are excluded for example the decipherment of signs others are implied for example description according to a particular code given too the different positions that the discoursing subject may occupy as an observing subject with instrumental mediation as a subject selecting out of the perceptual plurality only the elements of the structure as a subject transcribing these elements into a coded vocabulary etc there are a number of coexistences between the statements that are excluded as for example the erudite reactivation of the alreadysaid or the exegetic commentary of a sacralized text others on the other hand that are possible or required such as the integration of totally or partially analogous statements into a classificatory table The levels are not free from one another therefore and are not deployed according to an unlimited autonomy between the primary differentiation of objects and the formation of discursive strategies there exists a whole hierarchy of relations   82 But relations are also established in a reverse direction The lower levels are not independent of those above them Theoretical choices exclude or imply in the statements in which they are made the formation of certain concepts that is certain forms of coexistence between statements thus in the texts of the Physiocrats one will not find the same modes of integrating quantitative data and measurements as in the analyses of the Utilitarists It is not that the Physiocratic option can modify the group of rules that govern the formation of economic concepts in the eighteenth century but it can implement some of these rules and exclude others and consequently reveal certain concepts like that for example of the net product that appear nowhere else It is not the theoretical choice that governs the formation of the concept but the choice has produced the concept by the mediation of specific rules for the formation of concepts and by the set of relations that it holds with this level  2 These systems of formation must not be taken as blocks of immobility static forms that are imposed on discourse from the outside and that define once and for all its characteristics and possibilities They are not constraints whose origin is to be found in the thoughts of men or in the play of their representations but nor are they determinations which formed at the level of institutions or social or economic relations transcribe themselves by force on the surface of discourses These systems  I repeat  reside in discourse itself or rather since we are concerned not with its interiority and what it may contain but with its specific existence and with its conditions on its frontier at that limit at which the specific rules that enable it to exist as such are defined By system of formation then I mean a complex group of relations that function as a rule it lays down what must be related in a particular discursive practice for such and such an enunciation to be made for such and such a concept to be used for such and such a strategy to be organized To define a system of formation in its specific individuality is therefore to characterize a discourse or a group of statements by the regularity of a practice As a group of rules for a discursive practice the system of formation is not a stranger to time It does not concentrate everything that may appear through an ageold series of statements into an initial point that 83 is at the same time beginning origin foundation system of axioms and on the basis of which the events of real history have merely to unfold in a quite necessary way What it outlines is the system of rules that must be put into operation if such and such an object is to be transformed such and such a new enumeration appear such and such a concept he developed whether metamorphosed or imported and such and such a strategy he modified  without ever ceasing to belong to this same discourse and what it also outlines is the system of rules that has to be put into operation if a change in other discourses in other practices in institutions in social relations and in economic processes is to be transcribed within a given discourse thus constituting a new object giving rise to a new strategy giving place to new enunciations or new concepts A discursive formation then does not play the role of a figure that arrests time and freezes it for decades or centuries it determines a regularity proper to temporal processes it presents the principle of articulation between a series of discursive events and other series of events transformations mutations and processes It is not an atemporal form but a schema of correspondence between several temporal series This mobility of the system of formation appears in two ways First at the level of the elements that are being related to one another these in fact may undergo a number of intrinsic mutations that are integrated into discursive practice without the general form of its regularity being altered thus throughout the nineteenth century criminal jurisprudence demographic pressure the demand for labour the forms of public assistance the status and juridical conditions of internment were continually changing yet the discursive practice of psychiatry continued to establish the same group of relations between these elements in this way the system preserved the characteristics of its individuality through the same laws of formation new objects appear new types of individuals new classes of behaviour are characterized as pathological new modalities of enunciation are put into operation quantitative notations and statistical calculations new concepts are outlined such as those of degeneracy perversion neurosis and of course new theoretical structures can be built But inversely the discursive practices modify the domains that they relate to one another It is no use establishing specific relations that can be analysed only at their   84 own level  the effect of these relations is not confined to discourse alone it is also felt in the elements that they articulate upon one another The hospital field for example did not remain unaffected when clinical discourse was put into relation with the laboratory the body of rules that governed its working the status accorded the hospital doctor the function of his observation the level of analysis that can be carried out in it were necessarily modified  3 What are described as systems of formation do not constitute the terminal stage of discourse if by that term one means the texts or words as they appear with their vocabulary syntax logical structure or rhetorical organization Analysis remains anterior to this manifest level which is that of the completed construction in defining the principle of distributing objects in a discourse it does not take into account all their connexions their delicate structure or their internal subdivisions in seeking the law of the dispersion of concepts it does not take into account all the processes of elaboration or all the deductive series in which they may figure if analysis studies the modalities of enunciation it questions neither the style nor the succession of the sentences in short it leaves the final placing of the text in dotted outline But we must be clear on one point if analysis stands back in relation to this final construction it is not to turn away from the discourse and to appeal to the silent work of thought nor is it to turn away from the systematic and to reveal the living disorder of attempts trials errors and new beginnings  In this respect the analysis of discursive formations is opposed to many customary descriptions One is used in fact to consider that discourses and their systematic ordering are not only the ultimate state the final result of a long and often sinuous development involving language longue and thought empirical experience and categories the lived and ideal necessities the contingency of events and the play of formal constraints Behind the visible facade of the system one posits the rich uncertainty of disorder and beneath the thin surface of discourse the whole mass of a largely silent development devenir a presystematic that is not of the order of the system a prediscursive that belongs to an essential silence Discourse and system produce each other  and    85 conjointly  only at the crest of this immense reserve What are being analysed here are certainly not the terminal states of discourse they are the preterminal regularities in relation to which the ultimate state far from constituting the birthplace of a system is defined by its variants Behind the completed system what is discovered by the analysis of formations is not the bubbling source of life itself life in an as yet uncaptured state it is an immense density of systematicities a tight group of multiple relations Moreover these relations cannot be the very web of the text  they are not by nature foreign to discourse They can certainly be qualified as prediscursive but only if one admits that this prediscursive is still discursive that is that they do not specify a thought or a consciousness or a group of representations which a posteriori and in a way that is never quite necessary are transcribed into a discourse but that they characterize certain levels of discourse that they define rules that are embodied as a particular practice by discourse One is not seeking therefore to pass from the text to thought from talk to silence from the exterior to the interior from spatial dispersion to the pure recollection of the moment from superficial multiplicity to profound unity One remains within the dimension of discourse Part III The Statement and the Archive  89   1 DEFINING THE STATEMENT I suppose that by now we have accepted the risk that we are now willing in order to articulate the great surface of discourse to posit the existence of those somewhat strange somewhat distant figures that I have called discursive formations that we have put to one side not in a definitive way but for a time and out of methodological rigour the traditional unities of the book and the ceuvre that we have ceased to accept as a principle of unity the laws of constructing discourse with the formal organization that results or the situation of the speaking subject with the context and the psychological nucleus that characterize it that we no longer relate discourse to the primary ground of experience nor to the a priori authority of knowledge but that we seek the rules of its formation in discourse itself I suppose that we have agreed to undertake these long inquiries into the system of emergence of objects the system of the appearance and distribution of enunciative modes the system of the placing and dispersion of concepts the system of the deployment of strategic choices I suppose that we are willing to construct such abstract problematic unities instead of welcoming those that presented themselves as being more or less perceptually familiar if not as selfevident realities But what in fact have I been speaking about so far What has been the object of my inquiry And what did I intend to describe   90 Statements  both in that discontinuity that frees them from all the forms in which one was so ready to allow them to be caught and in the general unlimited apparently formless field of discourse But I refrained from providing a preliminary definition of the statement Nor did I try to construct one as I proceeded in order to justify the naivety of my startingpoint Moreover  and this no doubt is the reason for so much unconcern  I wonder whether I have not changed direction on the way whether I have not replaced my first quest with another whether while analysing objects or concepts let alone strategies I was in fact still speaking of statements whether the four groups of rules by which I characterized a discursive formation really did define groups of statements Lastly instead of gradually reducing the rather fluctuating meaning of the word discourse I believe that I have in fact added to its meanings treating it sometimes as the general domain of all statements sometimes as an individualizable group of statements and sometimes as a regulated practice that accounts for a certain number of statements and have I not allowed this same word discourse which should have served as a boundary around the term statement to vary as I shifted my analysis or its point of application as the statement itself faded from view This then is the task that now confronts me to take up the definition of the statement at its very root And to see whether that definition really was present in my earlier descriptions to see whether I really was dealing with the statement in my analysis of discursive formations On several occasions I have used the term statement either to speak of a population of statements as if I were dealing with individuals or isolated events or in order to distinguish it from the groups that I called discourses as the part is distinguished from the whole At first sight the statement appears as an ultimate undecomposable element that can be isolated and introduced into a set of relations with other similar elements A point without a surface but a point that can be located in planes of division and in specific forms of groupings A seed that appears on the surface of a tissue of which it is the constituent element The atom of discourse And the problem soon arises if the statement really is the elementary unit of discourse what does it consist of What are its distinctive   91 features What boundaries must one accord to it Is this unity identical with that to which logicians have given the term proposition and that which grammarians call a sentence or that which analysts try to map by the term speech act What place does it occupy among all those unities that the investigation of language langage has already revealed Even though the theory of these unities is so often incomplete on account of the difficulty of the problems that they present and the difficulty in many cases of delimiting them with any degree of rigour I do not think that the necessary and sufficient condition of a statement is the presence of a defined propositional structure or that one can speak of a statement only when there is a proposition In fact one can have two perfectly distinct statements referring to quite different discursive groupings when one finds only one proposition possessing only one value obeying only one group of laws for its construction and involving the same possibilities of use No one heard and It is true that no one heard are indistinguishable from a logical point of view and cannot be regarded as two different propositions But in so many statements these two formations are not equivalent or interchangeable They cannot occupy the same place on the plane of discourse nor can they belong to exactly the same group of statements If one finds the formulation No one heard in the first line of a novel we know until a new order emerges that it is an observation made either by the author or by a character aloud or in the form of an interior monologue if one finds the second formulation It is true that no one heard one can only be in a group of statements constituting an interior monologue a silent discussion with oneself or a fragment of dialogue a group of questions and answers In each case there is the same propositional structure but there are distinct enunciative characteristics There may on the other hand be complex and doubled propositional forms or on the contrary fragmentary incomplete propositions when one is quite obviously dealing with a simple complete autonomous statement even if it is part of group of other statements the example The present king of France is bald is well known it can be analysed from a logical point of view only if one accepts in the form of a single statement two distinct propositions each of which may be true or false on its own account or again there is a   92 proposition like I am lying which can be true only in relation to an assertion on a lower level The criteria by which one can define the identity of a proposition distinguish several of them beneath the unity of a formulation characterize its autonomy or its completion are not valid when one comes to describe the particular unity of a statement And what of the sentence Should we not accept an equivalence between sentence and statement Wherever there is a grammatically isolable sentence one can recognize the existence of an independent statement but on the other hand one cannot speak of statement when beneath the sentence itself one reaches the level of its constituents It would he pointless to object against such an equivalence that some statements may be composed outside the canonical form of subjectcopulapredicate of a simple nominal syntagma That man or an adverb Absolutely or a personal pronoun You For the grammarians themselves recognize such formulations as independent sentences even if those formulations have been obtained through a series of transformations on the basis of the subjectpredicate schema Moreover they recognize as acceptable sentences groups of linguistic elements that have not been correctly constructed providing they are interpretable on the other hand they accord the status of grammatical sentences to interpretable groups on condition however that they are correctly formed With so broad  and in a sense so lax  a definition of the sentence it is difficult to see how one is to recognize sentences that are not statements or statements that are not sentences Yet the equivalence is far from being a total one and it is relatively easy to cite statements that do not correspond to the linguistic structure of sentences When one finds in a Latin grammar a series of words arranged in a column amo amas amat one is dealing not with a sentence but with the statement of the different personal inflexions of the present indicative of the verb amare One may find this example debatable one may say that it is a mere artifice of presentation that this statement is an elliptical abbreviated sentence spatialized in a relatively unusual mode that should he read as the sentence The present indicative of the verb amare is amo for the first person etc Other examples in any case are less ambiguous a classificatory table of the botanical species is made up of statements not sentences Linnaeuss Genera Plantarum is a whole book of statements in which one can recognize   93 only a small number of sentences a genealogical tree an accounts book the calculations of a trade balance are statements where are the sentences One can go further an equation of the nth degree or the algebraic formula of the law of refraction must be regarded as statements and although they possess a highly rigorous grammaticality since they are made up of symbols whose meaning is determined by rules of usage and whose succession is governed by laws of construction this grammaticality cannot be judged by the same criteria that in a natural language Iangue make it possible to define an acceptable or interpretable sentence Lastly a graph a growth curve an age pyramid a distribution could are all statements any sentences that may accompany them are merely interpretation or commentary they are in no way an equivalent this is proved by the fact that in a great many cases only an infinite number of sentences could equal all the elements that are explicitly formulated in this sort of statement It would not appear to be possible therefore to define a statement by the grammatical characteristics of the sentence One last possibility remains at first sight the most likely of all Can one not say that there is a statement wherever one can recognize and isolate an act of formulation  something like the speech act referred to by the English analysts This term does not of course refer to the material act of speaking aloud or to oneself or of writing by hand or typewriter nor does it refer to the intention of the individual who is speaking the fact that he wants to convince someone else to be obeyed to discover the solution to a problem or to communicate information  nor does it refer to the possible result of what he has said whether he has convinced someone or aroused his suspicion whether he was listened to and whether his orders were carried out whether his prayer was heard what one is referring to is the operation that has been carried out by the formula itself in its emergence promise order decree contract agreement observation The speech act is not what took place just prior to the moment when the statement was made in the authors thought or intentions it is not what might have happened after the event itself in its wake and the consequences that it gave rise to it is what occurred by the very fact that a statement was made  and precisely this statement and no other in specific circumstances Presumably therefore one individualization of statements   94 refers to the same criteria as the location of acts of formulation each act is embodied in a statement each statement contains one of those acts They exist through one another in an exact reciprocal relationship Yet such a correlation does not stand up to examination For one thing more than a statement is often required to effect a speech act an oath a prayer a contract a promise or a demonstration usually require a certain number of distinct formulas or separate sentences it would be difficult to challenge the right of each of these formulas and sentences to be regarded as a statement on the pretext that they are all imbued with one and the same speech act In that case it might be said that the act itself does not remain the same throughout the series of statements that in a prayer there are as many limited successive and juxtaposed acts of prayer as demands formulated by distinct statements and that in a promise there are as many engagements as sequences that can be individualized into separate statements But one cannot be satisfied with this answer first because the act of formulation would no longer serve to define the statement but on the contrary the act of formulation would be defined by the statement  which raises problems and requires criteria of individualization Moreover certain speech acts can be regarded as complete in their particular unity only if several statements have been made each in its proper place These acts are not constituted therefore by the series or sum of these statements by their necessary juxtaposition they cannot be regarded as being present whole and entire in the least of them and as renewing themselves with each one So one cannot establish a hiunivocal relation between the group of statements and that of speech acts either When one wishes to individualize statements one cannot therefore accept unreservedly any of the models borrowed from grammar logic or analysis In all three cases one realizes that the criteria proposed are too numerous and too heavy that they limit the extent of the statement and that although the statement sometimes takes on the forms described and adjusts itself to them exactly it does not always do so one finds statements lacking in legitimate propositional structure one finds statements where one cannot recognize a sentence one finds more statements that one can isolate speech acts As if the statement were more tenuous less charged with determinations less strongly structured more omnipresent too than all these figures as if it had   95 fewer features and ones less difficult to group together but as if by that very fact it rejected all possibility of describing anything And this is all the more so in that it is difficult to see at what level it should be situated and by what method it should be approached for all the analyses mentioned above there is never more than a support or accidental substance in logical analysis it is what is left when the propositional structure has been extracted and defined for grammatical analysis it is the series of linguistic elements in which one may or may not recognize the form of a sentence for the analysis of speech acts it appears as the visible body in which they manifest themselves In relation to all these descriptive approaches it plays the role of a residual element of a mere fact of irrelevant raw material Must we admit in the end that the statement cannot possess a character of its own and that it cannot be adequately defined in so far as it is for all analyses of language langage the extrinsic material on the basis of which they determine their own object Must we admit that any series of signs figures marks or traces  whatever their organization or probability may be  is enough to constitute a statement and that it is the role of grammar to say whether or not it is a sentence the role of logic to decide whether or not it contains a propositional form the role of Analysis to determine what speech act it may embody In which case we would have to admit that there is a statement whenever a number of signs are juxtaposed  or even perhaps  when there is a single sign The threshold of the statement is the threshold of the existence of signs Yet even here things are not so simple and the meaning of a term like the existence of signs requires elucidation What does one mean when one says that there are signs and that it is enough for there to be signs for there to he a statement What special status should be given to that verb to be For it is obvious that statements do not exist in the same sense in which a language longue exists and with that language a collection of signs defined by their contrasting characteristics and their rules of use a language in fact is never given in itself in its totality it could only he so in a secondary way in the oblique form of a description that would take it as its object the signs that make up its elements are forms that are imposed upon statements and control them from within If there were no statements the language longue would not exist but no 96   statement is indispensable for a language to exist and one can always posit in place of any statement another statement that would in no way modify the language The language exists only as a system for constructing possible statements but in another respect it exists only as a more or less exhaustive description obtained from a collection of real statements Language longue and statement are not at the same level of existence and one cannot say that there are statement in the same way as one says that there are languages longues But is it enough then that the signs of a language constitute a statement if they were produced articulated drawn made traced in one way or another if they appeared in a moment of time and in a point in space if the voice that spoke them or the gesture that formed them gave them the dimensions of a material existence Can the letters of the alphabet written by me haphazardly on to a sheet of paper as an example of what is not a statement can the lead characters used for printing books  and one cannot deny their materiality which has space and volume  can these signs spread out visible manipulable be reasonably regarded as statements When looked at more closely however these two examples the lead characters and the signs that I wrote down on the sheet of paper are seen to be not quite superposable This pile of printers characters which I can hold in my hand or the letters marked on the keyboard of a typewriter are not statements at most they are tools with which one can write statements On the other hand what are the letters that I write down haphazardly on to a sheet of paper just as they come to mind and to show that they cannot in their disordered state constitute a statement What figure do they form Are they not a table of letters chosen in a contingent way the statement of an alphabetical series governed by other laws than those of chance Similarly the table of random numbers that statisticians sometimes use is a series of numerical symbols that are not linked together by any syntactical structure and yet that series is a statement that of a group of figures obtained by procedures that eliminate everything that might increase the probability of the succeeding issues Let us look at the example again the keyboard of a typewriter is not a statement but the same series of letters A Z E R T listed in a typewriting manual is the statement of the alphabetical order adopted by French typewriters So we are   97 presented with a number of negative consequences a regular linguistic construction is not required in order to form a statement this statement may be made up of a series possessing a minimal probability  but neither is it enough to have any material effectuation of linguistic elements any emergence of signs in time and space for a statement to appear and to begin to exist The statement exists therefore neither in the same way as a language longue although it is made up of signs that are definable in their individuality only within a natural or artificial linguistic system nor in the same way as the object presented to perception although it is always endowed with a certain materiality and can always he situated in accordance with spatiotemporal coordinates This is not the place to answer the general question of the statement but the problem can be clarified the statement is not the same kind of unit as the sentence the proposition or the speech act it cannot be referred therefore to the same criteria but neither is it the same kind of unit as a material object with its limits and independence In its way of being unique neither entirely linguistic nor exclusively material it is indispensable if we want to say whether or not there is a sentence proposition or speech act and whether the sentence is correct or acceptable or interpretable whether the proposition is legitimate and well constructed whether the speech act fulfils its requirements and was in fact carried out We must not seek in the statement a unit that is either long or short strongly and weakly structured but one that is caught up like the others in a logical grammatical locutory nexus It is not so much one element among others a division that can he located at a certain level of analysis as a function that operates vertically in relation to these various units and which enables one to say of a series of signs whether or not they are present in it The statement is not therefore a structure that is a group of relations between variable elements thus authorizing a possibly infinite number of concrete models it is a function of existence that properly belongs to signs and on the basis of which one may then decide through analysis or intuition whether or not they make sense according to what rule they follow one another or are juxtaposed of what they are the sign and what sort of act is carried out by their formulation oral or written One should not be surprised then if one has failed to find structural   98 criteria of unity for the statement this is because it is not in itself a unit but a function that cuts across a domain of structures and possible unities and which reveals them with concrete contents in time and space It is this function that we must now describe as such that is in its actual practice its conditions the rules that govern it and the field in which it operates 99  2 THE ENUNCIATIVE FUNCTION It is useless therefore to look for the statement among unitary groups of signs The statement is neither a syntagma nor a rule of construction nor a canonic form of succession and permutation it is that which enables such groups of signs to exist and enables these rules or forms to become manifest But although it enables them to exist it does so in a special way  a way that must not be confused with the existence of signs as elements of a language longue or with the material existence of those marks that occupy a fragment of space or last for a variable length of time It is this special mode of existence characteristic of every series of signs providing it is stated that we must now examine  a So let us take once again the example of those signs made or drawn in a defined materiality and grouped in a particular way which may or may not be arbitrary but which in any case is not grammatical the keyboard of a typewriter or a handful of printers characters All that is required is that the signs be given that I copy them on to a sheet of paper in the same order in which they appear but without producing a word for a statement to emerge the statement of the letters of the alphabet in an order that makes the typing of them easier and the statement of a random group of letters What has happened 100 then that a statement should have been made What can the second group possess that is not possessed by the first Reduplication the fact that it is a copy Certainly not since the keyboards of typewriters all copy a certain model and are not by that very fact statements The intervention of a subject This answer is inadequate for two reasons it is not enough that the reiteration of a series be due to the initiative of an individual for it to be transformed by that very fact into a statement and in any case the problem does not lie in the cause or origin of the reduplication but in the special relation between the two identical series The second series is not a statement because and only because a hiunivocal relation can be established between each of its elements in the first series this relation characterizes either the fact of duplication if it is simply a copy or the exactitude of the statement if one has in fact crossed the threshold of enunciation but it does not allow us to define this threshold and the very fact of the statement A series of signs will become a statement on condition that it possesses something else which may be strangely similar to it and almost identical as in the example chosen a specific relation that concerns itself  and not its cause or its elements It may be objected that there is nothing enigmatic about this relation that on the contrary it is a very familiar one which is constantly being analysed that in fact it concerns the relation of the signifier significant to the signified signifie of the name to what it designates the relation of the sentence to its meaning the relation of the proposition to its referent referent But I believe that one can show that the relation of the statement to what it states is not superposable on any of these relations The statement even if reduced to a nominal syntagma The boat even if it is reduced to a proper noun Peter does not have the same relation with what it states as the name with what it designates or signifies The name or noun is a linguistic element that may occupy different places in grammatical groups its meaning is defined by its rules of use whether these concern individuals who may be validly designated by it or syntactical structures in which it may correctly participate a noun is defined by its possibility of recurrence A statement exists outside any possibility of reappearing and the relation that it possesses with what it states is not identical with a group of rules of 101 use It is a very special relation and if in these conditions an identical formulation reappears with the same words substantially the same names  in fact exactly the same sentence  it is not necessarily the same statement Nor should the relation between a statement and what it states be confused with the relation between a proposition and its referent We know that logicians say that a proposition like The golden mountain is in California cannot be verified because it has no referent its negation is therefore neither more nor less true than its affirmation Should we say similarly that a statement refers to nothing if the proposition to which it lends existence has no referent Rather the reverse We should say not that the absence of a referent brings with it the absence of a correlate for the statement but that it is the correlate of the statement  that to which it refers not only what is said but also what it speaks of its theme  which makes it possible to say whether or not the proposition has a referent it alone decides this in a definitive way Let us suppose in fact that the formulation The golden mountain is in California is found not in a geography book nor in a travel book but in a novel or in some fictional context or other one could still accord it a value of truth or error according to whether the imaginary world to which it refers does or does not authorize such a geological and geographical fantasy We must know to what the statement refers what is its space of correlations if we are to say whether a proposition has or has not a referent The present king of France is bald lacks a referent only if one supposes that the statement refers to the world of contemporary historical information The relation of the proposition to the referent cannot serve as a model or as a law for the relation of the statement to what it states The latter relation not only does not belong to the same level as the former but it is anterior to it Nor is it superposable to the relation that may exist between a sentence and its meaning The gap between these two forms of relation appears clearly in the case of two famous sentences that are meaningless in spite of their perfectly correct grammatical structure as in the example Colourless green ideas sleep furiously In fact to say that a sentence like this is meaningless presupposes that one has already excluded a number of possibilities  that it describes a dream that it is part of a poetic text that it is a coded message that it is spoken by a 102 drug addict  and that one assumes it to be a certain type of statements that must refer in a very definite way to some visible reality The relation of a sentence with its meaning resides within a specific wellstabilized enunciative relation Moreover even if these sentences are taken at an enunciative level at which they are meaningless they are not as statements deprived of correlations there are those that enable one to say for example that ideas are never either coloured or colourless and therefore that the sentence is meaningless and these correlations concern a level of reality in which ideas are invisible and in which colours can he seen etc there are also those correlations that validate the sentence in question as a mention of a type of correct syntactical organization that was also meaningless and these correlations concern the level of the language langue with its laws and properties A sentence cannot be nonsignificant it refers to something by virtue of the fact that it is a statement How then can we define this relation that characterizes the statement as statement  a relation that seems to be implicitly presupposed by the sentence or the proposition and which is anterior to it How can we disentangle it from those relations of meaning or those values of truth with which it is usually confused Any statement as simple a statement as one can imagine does not have as its correlate an individual or a particular object that is designated by this or that word in the sentence in the case of a statement like The golden mountain is in California the correlate is not the formation real or imaginary possible or absurd that is designated by the nominal syntagma that serves as the subject But nor is the correlate of the statement a state of things or a relation capable of verifying the proposition in the example chosen this would be the spatial inclusion of a particular mountain in a particular region On the other hand what might he defined as the correlate of the statement is a group of domains in which such objects may appear and to which such relations may be assigned it would for example be a domain of material objects possessing a certain number of observable physical properties relations of perceptible size  or on the contrary it would he domain of fictitious objects endowed with arbitrary properties even if they have a certain constancy and a certain coherence without any authority of experimental or perceptive verification it would be a domain of spatial and geographical localizations   103 with coordinates distances relations of proximity and of inclusion  or on the contrary a domain of symbolic appurtenances and secret kinships it would be a domain of objects that exist at the same moment and on the same timescale as the statement is formulated or it would be a domain of objects that belongs to a quite different present  that indicated and constituted by the statement itself and not that to which the statement also belongs A statement is not confronted face to face as it were by a correlate  or the absence of a correlate  as a proposition has or has not a referent or as a proper noun designates someone or no one It is linked rather to a referential that is made up not of things facts realities or beings but of laws of possibility rules of existence for the objects that are named designated or described within it and for the relations that are affirmed or denied in it The referential of the statement forms the place the condition the field of emergence the authority to differentiate between individuals or objects states of things and relations that are brought into play by the statement itself it defines the possibilities of appearance and delimitation of that which gives meaning to the sentence a value as truth to the proposition It is this group that characterizes the enunciative level of the formulation in contrast to its grammatical and logical levels through the relation with these various domains of possibility the statement makes of a syntagma or a series of symbols a sentence to which one may or may not ascribe a meaning a proposition that may or may not be accorded a value as truth One can see in any case that the description of this enunciative level can be performed neither by a formal analysis nor by a semantic investigation nor by verification but by the analysis of the relations between the statement and the spaces of differentiation in which the statement itself reveals the differences  b A statement also differs from any series of linguistic elements by virtue of the fact that it possesses a particular relation with a subject We must now define the nature of this relation and above all distinguish it from other relations with which it might be confused We must not in fact reduce the subject of the statement to the firstperson grammatical elements that are present within the sentence First because the subject of the sentence is not within the linguistic   104 syntagma secondly because a statement that does not involve a first person nevertheless has a subject lastly and above all all statements that have a fixed grammatical form whether in the first or second person do not have the same type of relation with the subject of the statement It is easy to see that this relation is not the same in a statement of the type Night is falling and Every effect has a cause while in the case of a statement of the type Longtemps je me Buis couche de bonne heure For a long time I used to go to bed early the relation to the enunciating subject is not the same if one hears it spoken in the course of a conversation and if one reads it at the beginning of Prousts A la Recherche du temps perdu Is not this subject exterior to the sentence quite simply the individual who spoke or wrote those words As we know there can be no signs without someone or at least something to emit them For a series of signs to exist there must  in accordance with the system of causality  be an author or a transmitting authority But this author is not identical with the subject of the statement and the relation of production that he has with the formulation is not superposable to the relation that unites the enunciating subject and what he states Let us ignore the oversimple case of a group of signs that have been materially fashioned or traced their production implies an author even though there is neither a statement nor a subject of a statement One might also mention by way of showing the dissociation between the transmitter of signs and the subject of a statement the case of a text read by a third person or that of an actor speaking his part But these are extreme cases Generally speaking it would seem at first sight at least that the subject of the statement is precisely he who has produced the various elements with the intention of conveying meaning Yet things are not so simple In a novel we know that the author of the formulation is that real individual whose name appears on the title page of the book we are still faced with the problem of the dialogue and sentences purporting to express the thoughts of a character we are still faced with the problem of texts published under a pseudonym and we know all the difficulties that these duplications raise for practitioners of interpretative analysis when they wish to relate these formulations en bloc to the author of the text to what he wanted to say to what he thought in short to that great silent hidden uniform   105 discourse on which they build that whole pyramid of different levels but even apart from those authorities of formulation that are not identical with the individualauthor the statements of the novel do not have the same subject when they provide as if from the outside the historical and spatial setting of the story when they describe things as they would be seen by an anonymous invisible neutral individual who moves magically among the characters of the novel or when they provide as if by an immediate internal decipherment the verbal version of what is silently experienced by a character Although the author is the same in each case although he attributes them to no one other than himself although he does not invent a supplementary link between what he is himself and the text that one is reading these statements do not presuppose the same characteristics for the enunciating subject they do not imply the same relation between this subject and what is being stated It might be said that the often quoted example of the fictional text has no conclusive validity or rather that it questions the very essence of literature and not the status the subject of statements in general According to this view it is in the nature of literature that the author should appear to be absent conceal himself within it delegate his authority or divide himself up and one should not draw a general conclusion from this dissociation that the subject of the statement is distinct in everything  in nature status function and identity  from the author of the formulation Yet this gap is not confined to literature alone It is absolutely general in so far as the subject of the statement is a particular function but is not necessarily the same from one statement to another in so far as it is an empty function that can be filled by virtually any individual when he formulates the statement and in so far as one and the same individual may occupy in turn in the same series of statements different positions and assume the role of different subjects Take the example of a mathematical treatise In the sentence in the preface in which one explains why this treatise was written in what circumstances in response to what unsolved problems or with what pedagogical aim in view using what methods after what attempts and failures the position of the enunciative subject can be occupied only by the author or authors of the formulation the conditions of individualization of the subject are in fact very strict very   106 numerous and authorize in this case only one possible subject On the other hand if in the main body of the treatise one meets a proposition like Two quantities equal to a third quantity are equal to each other the subject of the statement is the absolutely neutral position indifferent to time space and circumstances identical in any linguistic system and in any code of writing or symbolization that any individual may occupy when affirming such a proposition Moreover sentences like We have already shown that    necessarily involve statements of precise contextual conditions that were not implied by the preceding formulation the position is then fixed within a domain constituted by a finite group of statements it is localized in a series of enunciative events that must already have occurred it is established in a demonstrative time whose earlier stages are never lost and which do not need therefore to be begun again and repeated identically to be made present once more a mention is enough to reactivate them in their original validity it is determined by the prior existence of a number of effective operations that need not have been performed by one and the same individual he who is speaking now but which rightfully belong to the enunciating subject which are at his disposal and of which he may avail himself when necessary The subject of such a statement will be defined by these requisites and possibilities taken together and he will not be described as an individual who has really carried out certain operations who lives in an unbroken never forgotten time who has interiorized in the horizon of his consciousness a whole group of true propositions and who retains in the living present of his thought their potential reappearance this is merely in the case of individuals the psychological lived aspect of their position as enunciating subjects Similarly one might describe the specific position of the enunciating subject in sentences like I call straight any series of points that  or Let there be a finite series of any elements in each case the position of the subject is linked to the existence of an operation that is both determined and present in each case the subject of the statement is also the subject of the operation he who establishes the definition of a straight line is also he who states it he who posits the existence of a finite series is also and at the same time he who states it and in each case the subject links by means of this operation and the statement in   107 which it is embodied his statement as his own law There is a difference however in the first case what is stated is a convention of language langage  of that language that the enunciating subject must use and within which he is defined the enunciating subject and what is stated are therefore at the same level whereas for a formal analysis a statement like this one implies the difference of level proper to metalanguage in the second case on the other hand the enunciating subject brings into existence outside himself an object that belongs to a previously defined domain whose laws of possibility have already been articulated and whose characteristics precede the enunciation that posits it We saw above that the position of the enunciating subject is not always identical in the affirmation of a true proposition we now see that it is also not identical when an operation is carried out within the statement itself So the subject of the statement should not he regarded as identical with the author of the formulation  either in substance or in function He is not in fact the cause origin or startingpoint of the phenomenon of the written or spoken articulation of a sentence nor is it that meaningful intention which silently anticipating words orders them like the visible body of its intuition it is not the constant motionless unchanging focus of a series of operations that are manifested in turn on the surface of discourse through the statements It is a particular vacant place that may in fact be filled by different individuals but instead of being defined once and for all and maintaining itself as such throughout a text a book or an oeuvre this place varies  or rather it is variable enough to he able either to persevere unchanging through several sentences or to alter with each one It is a dimension that characterizes a whole formulation qua statement It is one of the characteristics proper to the enunciative function and enables one to describe it If a proposition a sentence a group of signs can be called statement it is not therefore because one day someone happened to speak them or put them into some concrete form of writing it is because the position of the subject can be assigned To describe a formulation qua statement does not consist in analysing the relations between the author and what he says or wanted to say or said without wanting to  but in determining what position can and must be occupied by any individual if he is to be the subject of it   108   c The third characteristic of the enunciative function it cannot operate without the existence of an associated domain This makes the statement something other something more than a mere collection of signs which in order to exist need only a material base  a writing surface sound malleable material the hollowed incision of a trace But this also and above all distinguishes it from the sentence and the proposition Take a group of words or symbols In order to decide whether they constitute a grammatical unit like the sentence or a logical unit like the proposition it is necessary and enough to determine the rules according to which it was constructed Peter arrived yesterday forms a sentence but Yesterday arrived Peter does not A  B  C  D constitutes a proposition but ABC   D does not Only an examination of the elements and of their distribution in reference to the system  natural or artificial  of the language longue enables us to distinguish between what is and what is not a proposition between what is a sentence and what is merely an accumulation of words Moreover this examination is enough to determine to what type of grammatical structure the sentence in question belongs affirmative sentence in the past tense containing a nominal subject etc or to what type of proposition the series of signs in question belongs an equivalence between two additions One can even conceive of a sentence or a proposition that is selfdetermining that requires no other sentence or proposition to serve as a context no other associated sentences or propositions that such a sentence or proposition would in such conditions be useless and unusable does not mean that one would not be able to recognize it even in its singularity One could no doubt make a number of objections to this One might say for example that a proposition can be established and individualized as such only if one knows the system of axioms that it obeys do not those definitions those rules those conventions of writing form an associated field inseparable from the proposition similarly the rules of grammar implicitly at work in the competence of the subject are necessary if one is to recognize a sentence and a sentence of a certain type It should be noted however that this group  actual or potential  does not belong to the same level as the proposition or the sentence but that it has a bearing on their possible elements succession and  109 distribution The group is not associated with them it is presupposed by them One might also object that many nontautological propositions cannot be verified on the basis of their rules of construction alone and that recourse to the referent is needed if one is to decide whether they are true or false but true or false a proposition remains a proposition and it is not recourse to the referent that decides whether or not it is a proposition The same goes for sentences in many cases they can yield their meaning only in relation to the context whether they contain deictic elements that refer to a concrete situation or make use of first  or secondperson pronouns that designate the speaking subject and his interlocutors or make use of pronominal elements or connecting particles that refer to earlier or later sentences but the fact that its meaning cannot be completed does not prevent the sentence from being grammatically complete and autonomous Certainly one is not very sure what a group of words like Ill tell you that tomorrow means in any case one can neither date this tomorrow nor name the interlocutors nor guess what is to be said Nevertheless it is a perfectly delimited sentence obeying the rules of construction of the language longue in which it is written Lastly one might object that without a context it is sometimes difficult to define the structure of a sentence I shall never know if he is dead may be construed I shall never know whether or not he is dead or I shall never be informed of his death when this even occurs But this ambiguity is perfectly definable simultaneous possibilities can be posited that belong to the structure proper of the sentence Generally speaking one can say that a sentence or a proposition  even when isolated even divorced from the natural context that could throw light on to its meaning even freed or cut off from all the elements to which implicitly or not it refers  always remains a sentence or a proposition and can always be recognized as such On the other hand the enunciative function  and this shows that it is not simply a construction of previously existing elements  cannot operate on a sentence or proposition in isolation It is not enough to say a sentence it is not even enough to say it in a particular relation to a field of objects or in a particular relation to a subject for a statement to exist it must be related to a whole adjacent field Or rather since this is not some additional relation that is superimposed on the others one   110 cannot say a sentence one cannot transform it into a statement unless a collateral space is brought into operation A statement always has borders peopled by other statements These borders are not what is usually meant by context  real or verbal  that is all the situational or linguistic elements taken together that motivate a formulation and determine its meaning They are distinct from such a context precisely in so far as they make it possible the contextual relation between one sentence and those before and after it is not the same in the case of a novel and in that of a treatise in physics the contextual relation between a formulation and the objective environment is not the same in a conversation and in the account of an experiment It is against the background of a more general relation between the formulations against the background of a whole verbal network that the effect of context may he determined Nor are these borders identical with the various texts and sentences that the subject may be conscious of when he speaks again they are more extensive than such a psychological setting and to a certain extent they determine that setting for according to the position status and role of one formulation among others  according to whether it belongs to the field of literature or as an isolated remark whether it is part of a narrative or the account of a demonstration  the way in which other statements are present in the mind of the subject will not he the same neither the same level nor the same form of linguistic experience of verbal memory of reference to what has already been said is operating in each case The psychological halo of a formulation is controlled from afar by the arrangement of the enunciative field The associated field that turns a sentence or a series of signs into a statement and which provides them with a particular context a specific representative content forms a complex web It is made up first of all by the series of other formulations within which the statement appears and forms one element the network of spoken formulations that make up a conversation the architecture of a demonstration hound on the one side by its premises and on the other by its conclusion the series of affirmations that make up a narrative The associated field is also made up of all the formulations to which the statement refers implicitly or not either by repeating them modifying them or adapting them or by opposing them or by commenting on them   111  there can be no statement that in one way or another does not reactualize others ritual elements in a narrative previously accepted propositions in a demonstration conventional sentences in a conversation The associated field is also made up of all the formulations whose subsequent possibility is determined by the statement and which may follow the statement as its consequence its natural successor or its conversational retort an order does not open up the same enunciative possibilities as the propositions of an axiomatic or the beginning of a narrative Lastly the associated field is made up of all the formulations whose status the statement in question shares among which it takes its place without regard to linear order with which it will fade away or with which on the contrary it will be valued preserved sacralized and offered as a possible object to a future discourse a statement is not dissociable from the status that it may receive as literature or as an unimportant remark that is barely worthy of being forgotten or as a scientific truth valid for all time or as prophetic words etc Generally speaking one can say that a sequence of linguistic elements is a statement only if it is immersed in an enunciative field in which it then appears as a unique element The statement is not the direct projection on to the plane of language langage of a particular situation or a group of representations It is not simply the manipulation by a speaking subject of a number of elements and linguistic rules At the very outset from the very root the statement is divided up into an enunciative field in which it has a place and a status which arranges for its possible relations with the past and which opens up for it a possible future Every statement is specified in this way there is no statement in general no free neutral independent statement but a statement always belongs to a series or a whole always plays a role among other statements deriving support from them and distinguishing itself from them it is always part of a network of statements in which it has a role however minimal it may be to play Whereas grammatical construction needs only elements and rules in order to operate whereas one might just conceive of a language longue  an artificial one of course  whose only purpose is the construction of a single sentence whereas the alphabet the rules of construction and transformation of a formal system being given one can perfectly well   112 define the first proposition of this language langage the same cannot be said of the statement There is no statement that does not presuppose others there is no statement that is not surrounded by a field of coexistences effects of series and succession a distribution of functions and roles If one can speak of a statement it is because a sentence a proposition figures at a definite point with a specific position in an enunciative network that extends beyond it Against this background of enunciative coexistence there stand out at an autonomous and describable level the grammatical relations between sentences the logical relations between propositions the metalinguistic relations between an object language and one that defines the rules the rhetorical relations between groups or elements of sentences It is permissible of course to analyse all these relations without taking as ones theme the enunciative field itself that is the domain of coexistence in which the enunciative function operates But they can exist and are analysable only to the extent that these sentences have been enunciated in other words to the extent that they are deployed in an enunciative field that allows them to follow one another order one another coexist with one another and play roles in relation to one another Far from being the principle of individualization of groups of signifiers the meaningful atom the minimum on the basis of which there is meaning the statement is that which situates these meaningful units in a space in which they breed and multiply  d Lastly for a sequence of linguistic elements to be regarded and analysed as a statement it must fulfil a fourth condition it must have a material existence Could one speak of a statement if a voice had not articulated it if a surface did not bear its signs if it had not become embodied in a senseperceptible element and if it had not left some trace  if only for an instant  in someones memory or in some space Could one speak of a statement as an ideal silent figure The statement is always given through some material medium even if that medium is concealed even if it is doomed to vanish as soon as it appears And the statement not only needs this materiality its materiality is not given to it in addition once all its determinations have been fixed it is partly made up of this materiality Even if a sentence is composed of the same   113 words bears exactly the same meaning and preserves the same syntactical and semantic identity it does not constitute the same statement if it is spoken by someone in the course of a conversation or printed in a novel if it was written one day centuries ago and if it now reappears in an oral formulation The coordinates and the material status of the statement are part of its intrinsic characteristics That is an obvious fact Or almost For as soon as one examines it a little more closely things begin to blur and the problems increase Of course it is tempting to say that if a statement is characterized partly at least by its material status and if its identity is susceptible to a modification of that status the same can be said of sentences and propositions the materiality of signs is not in fact entirely indifferent to grammar or even to logic We know what theoretical problems are presented to logic by the material constancy of the symbols used how to define the identity of a symbol through the various substances in which it may be embodied and the variations of form that it can tolerate How to recognize it and make certain that it is the same if it must be defined as a concrete physical form we know too what problems are presented to logic by the very notion of a series of symbols what do precede and follow mean Come before and after In what space is such an order situated Much better known still are the relations of materiality and the language longue  the role of writing and the alphabet the fact that neither the same syntax nor the same vocabulary operate in a written text and in a conversation in a newspaper and in a book in a letter and on a poster moreover there are series of words that form perfectly individualized and acceptable sentences if they feature as newspaper headlines and which nevertheless in the course of a conversation could never stand as meaningful sentences Yet the materiality plays a much more important role in the statement it is not simply a principle of variation a modification of the criteria of recognition or a determination of linguistic subgroups It is constitutive of the statement itself a statement must have a substance a support a place and a date And when these requisites change it too changes identity At this point a host of questions arises Does the same sentence repeated very loudly and very softly form one or more statements When one learns a text by heart does each recitation constitute a statement or should one regard it as a repetition of the same   114   statement A sentence is faithfully translated into a foreign language two distinct statements or one And in a collective recitation  a prayer or a lesson  how many statements are produced How can one establish the identity of the statement through all these various forms repetitions and transcriptions The problem is no doubt obscured by the fact that there is often a confusion of different levels To begin with we must set aside the multiplicity of enunciations We will say that an enunciation takes place whenever a group of signs is emitted Each of these articulations has its spatiotemporal individuality Two people may say the same thing at the same time but since there are two people there will he two distinct enunciations The same person may repeat the same sentence several times this will produce the same number of enunciations distinct in time The enunciation is an unrepeatable event it has a situated and dated uniqueness that is irreducible Yet this uniqueness allows of a number of constants  grammatical semantic logical  by which one can by neutralizing the moment of enunciation and the coordinates that individualize it recognize the general form of a sentence a meaning a proposition The time and place of the enunciation and the material support that it uses then become very largely at least indifferent and what stands out is a form that is endlessly repeatable and which may give rise to the most dispersed enunciations But the statement itself cannot be reduced to this pure event of enunciation for despite its materiality it cannot be repeated it would not be difficult to say that the same sentence spoken by two people in slightly different circumstances constitute only one statement And yet the statement cannot he reduced to a grammatical or logical form because to a greater degree than that form and in a different way it is susceptible to differences of material substance time and place What then is that materiality proper to the statement and which permits certain special types of repetition How is it that one can speak of the same statement when there are several distinct enunciations of it yet must speak of several statements when one can recognize identical forms structures rules of construction and intentions What then is this rule of repeatable materiality that characterizes the statement This may not he a perceptible qualitative materiality expressed in the form of colour sound or solidity and divided up by the same   115 spatiotemporal observation as the perceptual space Let us take a very simple example a text reproduced several times the successive editions of a book or better still the different copies of the same printing do not give rise to the same number of distinct statements in all the editions of Les Fleurs du mal variants and rejected versions apart  we find the same set of statements yet neither the characters nor the ink nor the paper nor even the placing of the text and the positions of the signs are the same the whole texture of the materiality has changed But in this case these small differences are not important enough to alter the identity of the statement and to bring about another they are all neutralized in the general element  material of course but also institutional and economic  of the book a book however many copies or editions are made of it however many different substances it may use is a locus of exact equivalence for the statements  for them it is an authority that permits repetition without any change of identity We see from this first example that the materiality of the statement is not defined by the space occupied or the date of its formulation but rather by its status as a thing or object A status that is never definitive but modifiable relative and always susceptible of being questioned we know for example that for literary historians the edition of a book published with the agreement of the author does not have the same status as posthumous editions that the statements in it have a unique value that they are not one of the manifestations of one and the same whole that they are that by relation to which there is and must be repetition Similarly between the text of a Constitution or a will or a religious revelation and all the manuscripts or printed copies that reproduce them exactly with the same writing in the same characters and on similar substances one cannot say that there is an equivalence on the one hand there are the statements themselves and on the other their reproduction The statement cannot be identified with a fragment of matter but its identity varies with a complex set of material institutions For a statement may be the same whether written on a sheet of paper or published in a book it may be the same spoken printed on a poster or reproduced on a taperecorder on the other hand when a novelist speaks a sentence in daily life then reproduces the same sentence in the manuscript that he is writing attributing it to one of his   116 characters or even allowing it to be spoken by that anonymous voice that passes for that of the author one cannot say that it is the same statement in each case The rule of materiality that statements necessarily obey is therefore of the order of the institution rather than of the spatiotemporal localization it defines possibilities of reinscription and transcription hut also thresholds and limits rather than limited and perishable individualities The identity of a statement is subjected to a second group of conditions and limits those that are imposed by all the other statements among which it figures by the domain in which it can be used or applied by the role and functions that it can perform The affirmation that the earth is round or that species evolve does not constitute the same statement before and after Copernicus before and after Darwin it is not for such simple formulations that the meaning of the words has changed what changed was the relation of these affirmations to other propositions their conditions of use and reinvestment the field of experience of possible verifications of problems to be resolved to which they can be referred The sentence dreams fulfil desires may have been repeated throughout the centuries it is not the same statement in Plato and in Freud The schemata of use the rules of application the constellations in which they can play a part their strategic potentialities constitute for statements a field of stabilization that makes it possible despite all the differences of enunciation to repeat them in their identity but this same field may also beneath the most manifest semantic grammatical or formal identities define a threshold beyond which there can be no further equivalence and the appearance of a new statement must be recognized But it is possible no doubt to go further there are cases in which one may consider that there is only one statement even though the words the syntax and the language langue itself are not identical Such cases are a speech and its simultaneous translation a scientific text in English and its French version a notice printed in three columns in three different languages there are not in such cases the same number of statements as there are languages used but a single group of statements in different linguistic forms Better still a given piece of information may be retransmitted with other words with a simplified syntax or in an agreed code if the information content and the uses to which it   117 could be put are the same one can say that it is the same statement in each case Here too we are concerned not with a criterion of individualization for the statement but rather with its principle of variation it is sometimes more diverse than the structure of the sentence and its identity is then finer more fragile more easily modifiable than that of a semantic or grammatical whole sometimes more constant than that structure and its identity is then broader more stable more susceptible to variations Moreover not only can this identity of the statement not be situated once and for all in relation to that of the sentence but it is itself relative and oscillates according to the use that is made of the statement and the way in which it is handled When one uses a statement in such a way as to reveal its grammatical structure its rhetorical configuration or the connotations that it may carry it is obvious that one cannot regard it as being identical in its original language longue and in a translation On the other hand if it is intended as part of a procedure of experimental verification then text and translation constitute a single enunciative whole Or again at a certain scale of macrohistory one may consider that an affirmation like species evolve forms the same statement in Darwin and in Simpson at a finer level and considering more limited fields of use neoDarwinism as opposed to the Darwinian system itself we are presented with two different statements The constancy of the statement the preservation of its identity through the unique events of the enunciations its duplications through the identity of the forms constitute the function of the field of use in which it is placed The statement then must not be treated as an event that occurred in a particular time and place and that the most one can do is recall it  and celebrate it from afar off  in an act of memory But neither is it an ideal form that can be actualized in any body at any time in any circumstances and in any material conditions Too repeatable to be entirely identifiable with the spatiotemporal coordinates of its birth it is more than the place and date of its appearance too bound up with what surrounds it and supports it to be as free as a pure form it is more than a law of construction governing a group of elements it is endowed with a certain modifiable heaviness a weight relative to the field in which it is placed a constancy that allows of various uses a 118 temporal permanence that does not have the inertia of a mere trace or mark and which does not sleep on its own past Whereas an enunciation may be begun again or reevoked and a linguistic or logical form may be reactualized the statement may be repeated  but always in strict conditions  This repeatable materiality that characterizes the enunciative function reveals the statement as a specific and paradoxical object but also as one of those objects that men produce manipulate use transform exchange combine decompose and recompose and possibly destroy Instead of being something said once and for all  and lost in the past like the result of a battle a geological catastrophe or the death of a king  the statement as it emerges in its materiality appears with a status enters various networks and various fields of use is subjected to transferences or modifications is integrated into operations and strategies in which its identity is maintained or effaced Thus the statement circulates is used disappears allows or prevents the realization of a desire serves or resists various interests participates in challenge and struggle and becomes a theme of appropriation or rivalry  119   3 THE DESCRIPTION OF STATEMENTS I now find that the analysis has shifted its ground to a quite considerable extent it was my intention to return to the definition of the statement which at the outset I had left in suspense It was as if I had regarded the statement as a unit that could be established without difficulty and that all I had to do was describe its possibilities and laws of combination I now realize that I could not define the statement as a unit of a linguistic type superior to the phenomenon of the word inferior to the text but that I was dealing with an enunciative function that involved various units these may sometimes be sentences sometimes propositions but they are sometimes made up of fragments of sentences series or tables of signs a set of propositions or equivalent formulations and instead of giving a meaning to these units this function relates them to a field of objects instead of providing them with a subject it opens up for them a number of possible subjective positions instead of fixing their limits it places them in a domain of coordination and coexistence instead of determining their identity it places them in a space in which they are used and repeated In short what has been discovered is not the atomic statement  with its apparent meaning its origin its limits and its individuality  but the   120 operational field of the enunciative function and the conditions according to which it reveals various units which may be but need not be of a grammatical or logical order But I now feel that I must answer two questions what do I now understand by the task which I originally set myself of describing statements How can this theory of the statement be adjusted to the analysis of discursive formations that I outlined previously I First task fix the vocabulary If we agree to call verbal performance or better linguistic performance any group of signs produced on the basis of a natural or artificial language langue we could call formulation the individual or possibly collective act that reveals on any material and according to a particular form that group of signs the formulation is an event that can always be located by its spatiotemporal coordinates which can always be related to an author and which may constitute in itself a specific act a performative act as the British analysts call it we can call sentence or proposition the units that grammar or logic may recognize in a group of signs these units may always be characterized by the elements that figure in them and by the rules of construction that unite them in relation to the sentence and the proposition the questions of origin time and place and context are merely subsidiary the decisive question is that of their correctness if only under the form of acceptability We will call statement the modality of existence proper to that group of signs a modality that allows it to be something more than a series of traces something more than a succession of marks on a substance something more than a mere object made by a human being a modality that allows it to be in relation with a domain of objects to prescribe a definite position to any possible subject to be situated among other verbal performances and to be endowed with a repeatable materiality We can now understand the reason for the equivocal meaning of the term discourse which I have used and abused in many different senses in the most general and vaguest way it denoted a group of verbal performances and by discourse then I meant that which was produced perhaps all that was produced by the groups of signs But I also meant a group of acts of formulation a series   121 of sentences or propositions Lastly  and it is this meaning that was finally used together with the first which served in a provisional capacity  discourse is constituted by a group of sequences of signs in so far as they are statements that is in so far as they can be assigned particular modalities of existence And if I succeed in showing as I shall try to do shortly that the law of such a series is precisely what I have so far called a discursive formation if I succeed in showing that this discursive formation really is the principle of dispersion and redistribution not of formulations not of sentences not of propositions but of statements in the sense in which I have used this word the term discourse can he defined as the group of statements that belong to a single system of formation thus I shall be able to speak of clinical discourse economic discourse the discourse of natural history psychiatric discourse I am well aware that most of these definitions do not conform with current usage linguists usually give the word discourse a quite different meaning logicians and analysts use the term statement in a different way But my intention here is not to transfer to some hitherto benighted domain a set of concepts a form of analysis and a theory that have been formed elsewhere and I do not intend to use a model by applying it with its own efficacy to new contents Not of course that I wish to question the value of such a model not that I wish even before trying it to limit its application or to lay down the threshold that it must not cross But I would like to reveal a descriptive possibility outline the domain of which it is capable define its limits and its autonomy This descriptive possibility is articulated upon others it does not derive from them In particular then the analysis of statements does not claim to he a total exhaustive description of language langage or of what was said In the whole density implied by verbal performances it is situated at a particular level that must be distinguished from the others characterized in relation to them and abstract In particular it does not replace a logical analysis of propositions a grammatical analysis of sentences a psychological or contextual analysis of formulations it is another way of attacking verbal performances of dissociating their complexity of isolating the terms that are entangled in its web and of locating the various regularities that they obey By confronting the   122 statement with the sentence or the proposition I am not trying to rediscover a lost totality or to resuscitate as many would nostalgically like to do the plenitude of living speech the richness of the Word the profound unity of the Logos The analysis of statements corresponds to a specific level of description  2 The statement then is not an elementary unity that can be added to the unities described by grammar or logic It cannot be isolated like a sentence a proposition or an act of formulation To describe a statement is not a matter of isolating and characterizing a horizontal segment but of defining the conditions in which the function that gave a series of signs a series that is not necessarily grammatical or logically structured an existence and a specific existence can operate An existence that reveals such a series as more than a mere trace but rather a relation to a domain of objects as more than the result of an action or an individual operation but rather a set of possible positions for a subject as more than an organic autonomous whole closed in upon itself and capable of forming meaning of its own accord but rather an element in a field of coexistence as more than a passing event or an inert object but rather a repeatable materiality The description of statements is concerned in a sort of vertical dimension with the conditions of existence of different groups of signifiers signifiants Hence a paradox the description of statements does not attempt to evade verbal performances in order to discover behind them or below their apparent surface a hidden element a secret meaning that lies buried within them or which emerges through them without saying so and yet the statement is not immediately visible it is not given in such a manifest way as a grammatical or logical structure even if such a structure is not entirely clear or is very difficult to elucidate The statement is neither visible nor hidden Not hidden by definition since it characterizes the modalities of existence proper to a group of effectively produced signs The analysis of statements can never confine its attention to the things said to the sentences that were actually spoken or written to the signifying elements that were traced or pronounced  and more particularly to that very uniqueness that gives them existence offers them to the view of the reader to a possible reactivation to innumerable uses or possible   123 transformations among other things but not like other things It cannot concern only realized verbal performances since it analyses them at the level of their existence it is a description of things said precisely as they were said The analysis of statements then is a historical analysis but one that avoids all interpretation it does not question things said as to what they are hiding what they were really saying in spite of themselves the unspoken element that they contain the proliferation of thoughts images or fantasies that inhabit them but on the contrary it questions them as to their mode of existence what it means to them to have come into existence to have left traces and perhaps to remain there awaiting the moment when they might be of use once more what it means to them to have appeared when and where they did  they and no others From this point of view there is no such thing as a latent statement for what one is concerned with is the fact of language langage A difficult thesis to sustain We know  and this has probably been the case ever since men began to speak  that one thing is often said in place of another that one sentence may have two meanings at once that an obvious meaning understood without difficulty by everyone may conceal a second esoteric or prophetic meaning that a more subtle deciphering or perhaps only the erosion of time will finally reveal that beneath a visible formulation there may reign another that controls it disturbs it and imposes on it an articulation of its own in short that in one way or another things said say more than themselves But in fact these apparent duplications this unsaid that is nevertheless said do not affect the statement at least as it has been defined here Polysemia  which justifies hermeneutics and the discovery of another meaning  concerns the sentence and the semantic fields that it employs the same group of words may give rise to several meanings and to several possible constructions there may be therefore interwoven or alternating different meanings operating on the same enunciative base Similarly the suppression of one verbal performance by another their substitution or interference are phenomena that belong to the level of the formulation even if they have incidences on the linguistic or logical structures but the statement itself is not concerned with this duplication or this suppression since it is the modality of existence of the verbal performance as it has taken place The   124 statement cannot be regarded as the cumulative result or the crystallization of several fluctuating scarcely articulated and mutually opposed statements The statement is not haunted by the secret presence of the unsaid of hidden meanings of suppressions on the contrary the way in which these hidden elements function and in which they can be restored depends on the enunciative modality itself we know that the unsaid the suppressed is not the same  either in its structure or in its effect  in the case of a mathematical statement a statement in economics an autobiography or the account of a dream However to all these various modalities of the unsaid that may be located against the background of the enunciative field should no doubt be added a lack which instead of being inside seems to be correlative with this field and to play a role in the determination of its very existence There may in fact be  and probably always are  in the conditions of emergence of statements exclusions limits or gaps that divide up their referential validate only one series of modalities enclose groups of coexistence and prevent certain forms of use But one should not confuse either in its status or in its effect the lack that is characteristic of an enunciative regularity and the meanings concealed in what is formulated in it  3 Although the statement cannot be hidden it is not visible either it is not presented to the perception as the manifest bearer of its limits and characteristics It requires a certain change of viewpoint and attitude to be recognized and examined in itself Perhaps it is like the overfamiliar that constantly eludes one those familiar transparencies which although they conceal nothing in their density are nevertheless not entirely clear The enunciative level emerges in its very proximity There are several reasons for this The first has already been given the statement is not just another unity  above or below  sentences and propositions it is always invested in unities of this kind or even in sequences of signs that do not obey their laws and which may be lists chance series tables it characterizes not what is given in them but the very fact that they are given and the way in which they are given It has this quasiinvisibility of the there is which is effaced in the very thing of which one can say there is this or that thing Another reason the signifying structure of language langage   125 always refers back to something else objects are designated by it meaning is intended by it the subject is referred back to it by a number of signs even if he is not himself present in them Language always seems to be inhabited by the other the elsewhere the distant it is hollowed by absence Is it not the locus in which something other than itself appears does not its own existence seem to be dissipated in this function But if one wishes to describe the enunciative level one must consider that existence itself question language not in the direction to which it refers but in the dimension that gives it ignore its power to designate to name to show to reveal to be the place of meaning or truth and instead turn ones attention to the moment  which is at once solidified caught up in the play of the signifier and the signified  that determines its unique and limited existence In the examination of language one must suspend not only the point of view of the signified we are used to this by now but also that of the signifier and so reveal the fact that here and there in relation to possible domains of objects and subjects in relation to other possible formulations and reuses there is language The last reason for this quasiinvisibility of the statement it is implied but never made explicit in all other analyses of language If language is to he taken as an object decomposed into distinct levels described and analysed an enunciative datum must exist that will always be determined and not infinite the analysis of a language longue always operates on a corpus of words and texts the uncovering and interpretation of implicit meanings always rests on a limited group of sentences the logical analysis of a system implies a given group of propositions in the rewriting in a formal language langage The enunciative level is neutralized each time either it is defined only as a representative sample that enables one to free endlessly applicable structures or it disappears into a pure appearance behind which the truth of words is revealed or it acts as a neutral substance that serves as a support for formal relations The fact that each time it is indispensable if an analysis is to take place deprives it of all relevance for the analysis itself If one adds to this that all these descriptions can be made only when they themselves form finite groups of statements it will be clear why they are surrounded on all sides by the enunciative field why they cannot free themselves from it and why they cannot take it   126 directly as its theme In considering statements in themselves we will not seek beyond all these analyses and at a deeper level some secret or some root of language langage that they have omitted We shall try to render visible and analysable that immediate transparency that constitutes the element of their possibility Neither hidden nor visible the enunciative level is at the limit of language langage it is not in itself a group of characteristics that are presented even in an unsystematic way to immediate experience but neither is it the enigmatic silent remainder that it does not translate It defines the modality of its appearance its periphery rather than its internal organization its surface rather than its content But the fact that one can describe this enunciative surface proves that the given the datum of language is not the mere rending of a fundamental silence that the words sentences meanings affirmations series of propositions do not hack directly on to a primeval night of silence but that the sudden appearance of a sentence the flash of meaning the brusque gesture of the index finger of designation always emerge in the operational domain of an enunciative function that between language as one reads and hears it and also as one speaks it and the absence of any formulation there is not a profusion of things half said sentences left unfinished thoughts half expressed an endless monologue of which only a few fragments emerge but before all  or in any case before it for it depends on them  the conditions according to which the enunciative function operates This also proves that it is vain to seek beyond structural formal or interpretative analyses of language a domain that is at last freed from all positivity in which the freedom of the subject the labour of the human being or the opening up of a transcendental destiny could be fulfilled One should not object to linguistic methods or logical analyses When you have said so much about the rules of its construction what do you do with language itself in the plenitude of its living body What do you do with this freedom or with this meaning that is prior to all signification without which individuals could not understand one another in the neverending work of language Are you not aware that as soon as one has crossed the finite systems that make possible the infinity of discourse but which are incapable of founding it and of accounting for it what one finds is the mark of a transcendence or the work of the human being   127 Do you know that you have described only a few of the characteristics of a language langage whose emergence and mode of being are entirely irreducible to your analyses Such objections must be set aside for if it is true that there is a dimension there that belongs neither to logic nor to linguistics it is not for all that a restored transcendence nor a way that has been reopened in the direction of an inaccessible origin nor a creation by the human being of his own meanings Language in its appearance and mode of being is the statement as such it belongs to a description that is neither transcendental nor anthropological The enunciative analysis does not lay down for linguistic or logical analyses the limit beyond which they must renounce their power and recognize their powerlessness it does not mark the line that encloses their domain it is deployed in another direction which intersects them The possibility of an enunciative analysis if it is established must make it possible to raise the transcendental obstacle that a certain form of philosophical discourse opposes to all analyses of language in the name of the being of that language and of the ground from which it should derive its origin I must now turn to the second group of questions how can the description of statements thus defined be adjusted to the analysis of discursive formations the principles of which I outlined above And inversely to what extent can one say that the analysis of discursive formations really is a description of statements in the sense in which I have used this word It is important to answer these questions for it is at this point that the enterprise to which I have devoted myself for so many years which I have developed in a somewhat blind way but of which I am now trying  even if I readjust it even if I rectify a number of errors or imprudences  to recapture the general outline must close its circle As has already become clear I am not trying to say here what I once tried to say in this or that concrete analysis or to describe the project that I had in mind the obstacles that I encountered the attempts that I was forced to abandon the more or less satisfactory results that I managed to obtain I am not describing an effective trajectory in order to indicate what should have been and what will be from   128 now on I am trying to elucidate in itself  in order to measure it and to determine its requirements  a possibility of description that I have used without being aware of its constraints and resources rather than trying to discover what I said and what I might have said I shall try to reveal in its own regularity  a regularity that I have not yet succeeded in mastering  what made it possible to say what I did But one can also see that I am not developing here a theory in the strict sense of the term the deduction on the basis of a number of axioms of an abstract model applicable to an indefinite number of empirical descriptions If such an edifice were ever possible the time for it has certainly not yet arrived I am not inferring the analysis of discursive formations from a definition of statements that would serve as a basis nor am I inferring the nature of statements from what discursive formations are as one was able to abstract them from this or that description but I am trying to show how a domain can be organized without flaw without contradiction without internal arbitrariness in which statements their principle of grouping the great historical unities that they may form and the methods that make it possible to describe them are all brought into question I am not proceeding by linear deduction but rather by concentric circles moving sometimes towards the outer and sometimes towards the inner ones beginning with the problem of discontinuity in discourse and of the uniqueness of the statement the central theme I have tried to analyse on the periphery certain forms of enigmatic groupings but the principles of unification with which I was then presented and which are neither grammatical nor logical nor psychological and which consequently cannot refer either to sentences propositions or representations forced me to return to the centre to that problem of the statement to try to elucidate what is meant by the term statement And I will consider not that I have constructed a rigorous theoretical model but that I have freed a coherent domain of description that I have if not established the model at least opened up and arranged the possibility of one if I have been able to loop the loop and show that the analysis of discursive formations really is centred on a description of the statement in its specificity In short if I have been able to show that they really are the proper dimensions of the statement that are at work in the mapping of discursive formations Rather than founding a theory  and perhaps before being   129 able to do so I do not deny that I regret not yet having succeeded in doing so  my present concern is to establish a possibility In examining the statement what we have discovered is a function that has a bearing on groups of signs which is identified neither with grammatical acceptability nor with logical correctness and which requires if it is to operate a referential which is not exactly a fact a state of things or even an object but a principle of differentiation a subject not the speaking consciousness not the author of the formulation but a position that may be filled in certain conditions by various individuals  an associated field which is not the real context of the formulation the situation in which it was articulated but a domain of coexistence for other statements a materiality which is not only the substance or support of the articulation but a status rules of transcription possibilities of use and reuse Now what has been described as discursive formations are strictly speaking groups of statements That is groups of verbal performances that are not linked to one another at the sentence level by grammatical syntactical or semantic links which are not linked to one another at the proposition level by logical links links of formal coherence or conceptual connexion and which are not linked either at the formulation level by psychological links either the identity of the forms of consciousness the constancy of the mentalities or the repetition of a project but which are linked at the statement level That which implies that one can define the general set of rules that govern their objects the form of dispersion that regularly divides up what they say the system of their referentials that which implies that one defines the general set of rules that govern the different modes of enunciation the possible distribution of the subjective positions and the system that defines and prescribes them that which implies that one defines the set of rules common to all their associated domains the forms of succession of simultaneity of the repetition of which they are capable and the system that links all these fields of coexistence together lastly that which implies that one can define the general set of rules that govern the status of these statements the way in which they are institutionalized received used reused combined together the mode according to which they become objects of appropriation instruments for desire or interest elements for a strategy To describe statements to describe the enunciative function of   130 which they are the bearers to analyse the conditions in which this function operates to cover the different domains that this function presupposes and the way in which those domains are articulated is to undertake to uncover what might be called the discursive formation Or again which amounts to the same thing but in the opposite direction the discursive formation is the general enunciative system that governs a group of verbal performances  a system that is not alone in governing it since it also obeys and in accordance with its other dimensions logical linguistic and psychological systems What has been called discursive formation divides up the general plane of things said at the specific level of statements The four directions in which it is analysed formation of objects formation of the subjective positions formation of concepts formation of strategic choices correspond to the four domains in which the enunciative function operates And if the discursive formations are free in relation to the great rhetorical unities of the text or the book if they are not governed by the rigour of a deductive architecture if they are not identified with the oeuvre of an author it is because they bring into play the enunciative level together with the regularities that characterize it and not the grammatical level of sentences or the logical level of propositions or the psychological level of formulation On this basis we can now advance a number of propositions that lie at the heart of these analyses  1  It can be said that the mapping of discursive formations independently of other principles of possible unification reveals the specific level of the statement but it can also be said that the description of statements and of the way in which the enunciative level is organized leads to the individualization of the discursive formations The two approaches are equally justifiable and reversible The analysis of the statement and that of the formation are established correlatively When the time finally comes to found a theory it will have to define a deductive order  2 A statement belongs to a discursive formation as a sentence belongs to a text and a proposition to a deductive whole But whereas the regularity of a sentence is defined by the laws of a language longue   131 and that of a proposition by the laws of logic the regularity of statements is defined by the discursive formation itself The fact of its belonging to a discursive formation and the laws that govern it are one and the same thing this is not paradoxical since the discursive formation is characterized not by principles of construction but by a dispersion of fact since for statements it is not a condition of possibility but a law of coexistence and since statements are not interchangeable elements but groups characterized by their modality of existence  3So we can now give a full meaning to the definition of discourse that we suggested above We shall call discourse a group of statements in so far as they belong to the same discursive formation it does not form a rhetorical or formal unity endlessly repeatable whose appearance or use in history might be indicated and if necessary explained  it is made up of a limited number of statements for which a group of conditions of existence can be defined Discourse in this sense is not an ideal timeless form that also possesses a history the problem is not therefore to ask oneself how and why it was able to emerge and become embodied at this point in time it is from beginning to end historical  a fragment of history a unity and discontinuity in history itself posing the problem of its own limits its divisions its transformations the specific modes of its temporality rather than its sudden irruption in the midst of the complicities of time  4Lastly what we have called discursive practice can now be defined more precisely It must not he confused with the expressive operation by which can individual formulates an idea a desire an image nor with the rational activity that may operate in a system of inference nor with the competence of a speaking subject when he constructs grammatical sentences it is a body of anonymous historical rules always determined in the time and space that have defined a given period and for a given social economic geographical or linguistic area the conditions of operation of the enunciative function  It remains for me now to invert the analysis and after referring discursive formations to the statements that they describe to seek in another direction this time towards the exterior the legitimate use of   132 these notions what can be discovered through them how they can take their place among other methods of description to what extent they can modify and redistribute the domain of the history of ideas But before operating this inversion and in order to operate it more surely I shall remain a little longer in the dimension that I have been exploring and try to define what the analysis of the enunciative field and of the formations that divide it up require and exclude   133   4 RARITY EXTERIORITY ACCUMULATION The enunciative analysis takes into consideration an element of rarity Generally speaking the analysis of discourse operates between the twin poles of totality and plethora One shows how the different texts with which one is dealing refer to one another organize themselves into a single figure converge with institutions and practices and carry meanings that may be common to a whole period Each element considered is taken as the expression of the totality to which it belongs and whose limits it exceeds And in this way one substitutes for the diversity of the things said a sort of great uniform text which has never before been articulated and which reveals for the first time what men really meant not only in their words and texts their discourses and their writings but also in the institutions practices techniques and objects that they produced In relation to this implicit sovereign communal meaning statements appear in superabundant proliferation since it is to that meaning alone that they all refer and to it alone that they owe their truth a plethora of signifying elements in relation to this single signified signifie But this primary and ultimate meaning springs up through the manifest formulations it hides beneath what appears and secretly duplicates it because each discourse   134 contains the power to say something other than what it actually says and thus to embrace a plurality of meanings a plethora of the signified in relation to a single signifier From this point of view discourse is both plenitude and endless wealth The analysis of statements and discursive formations opens up a quite contrary direction it wishes to determine the principle according to which only the signifying groups that were enunciated could appear It sets out to establish a law of rarity This task involves several aspects  It is based on the principle that everything is never said in relation to what might have been stated in a natural language longue in relation to the unlimited combination of linguistic elements statements however numerous they may be are always in deficit on the basis of the grammar and of the wealth of vocabulary available at a given period there are in total relatively few things that are said We must look therefore for the principle of rarification or at least of nonfilling of the field of possible formulations as it is opened up by the language longue Discursive formation appears both as a principle of division in the entangled mass of discourses and as a principle of vacuity in the field of language langage  We are studying statements at the limit that separates them from what is not said in the occurrence that allows them to emerge to the exclusion of all others Our task is not to give voice to the silence that surrounds them nor to rediscover all that in them and beside them had remained silent or had been reduced to silence Nor is it to study the obstacles that have prevented a particular discovery held hack a particular formulation repressed a particular form of enunciation a particular unconscious meaning or a particular rationality in the course of development but to define a limited system of presences The discursive formation is not therefore a developing totality with its own dynamism or inertia carrying with it in an unformulated discourse what it does not say what it has not yet said or what contradicts it at that moment it is not a rich difficult germination it is a distribution of gaps voids absences limits divisions   135 However we are not linking these exclusions to a repression we do not presuppose that beneath manifest statements something remains hidden and subjacent We are analysing statements not as being in the place of other statements that have fallen below the line of possible emergence but as being always in their own place They are put back into a space that is entirely deployed and involves no reduplication There is no subtext And therefore no plethora The enunciative domain is identical with its own surface Each statement occupies in it a place that belongs to it alone The description of a statement does not consist therefore in rediscovering the unsaid whose place it occupies nor how one can reduce it to a silent common text but on the contrary in discovering what special place it occupies what ramifications of the system of formations make it possible to map its localization how it is isolated in the general dispersion of statements  This rarity of statements the incomplete fragmented form of the enunciative field the fact that few things in all can be said explain that statements are not like the air we breathe an infinite transparency but things that are transmitted and preserved that have value and which one tries to appropriate that are repeated reproduced and transformed to which preestablished networks are adapted and to which a status is given in the institution things that are duplicated not only by copy or translation but by exegesis commentary and the internal proliferation of meaning Because statements are rare they are collected in unifying totalities and the meanings to be found in them are multiplied  Unlike all those interpretations whose very existence is possible only through the actual rarity of statements but which nevertheless ignore that rarity and on the contrary take as their theme the compact richness of what is said the analysis of discursive formations turns back towards that rarity itself it takes that rarity as its explicit object it tries to determine its unique system and at the same time it takes account of the fact that there could have been interpretation To interpret is a way of reacting to enunciative poverty and to compensate for it by a multiplication of meaning a way of speaking on the basis of that poverty and yet despite it But to analyse a discursive formation is to   136 seek the law of that poverty it is to weigh it up and to determine its specific form In one sense therefore it is to weigh the value of statements A value that is not defined by their truth that is not gauged by the presence of a secret content but which characterizes their place their capacity for circulation and exchange their possibility of transformation not only in the economy of discourse but more generally in the administration of scarce resources In this sense discourse ceases to be what it is for the exegetic attitude an inexhaustible treasure from which one can always draw new and always unpredictable riches a providence that has always spoken in advance and which enables one to hear when one knows how to listen retrospective oracles it appears as an asset  finite limited desirable useful  that has its own rules of appearance but also its own conditions of appropriation and operation an asset that consequently from the moment of its existence and not only in its practical applications poses the question of power an asset that is by nature the object of a struggle a political struggle Another characteristic feature the analysis of statements treats them in the systematic form of exteriority Usually the historical description of things said is shot through with the opposition of interior and exterior and wholly directed by a desire to move from the exterior  which may be no more than contingency or mere material necessity a visible body or uncertain translation  towards the essential nucleus of interiority To undertake the history of what has been said is to redo in the opposite direction the work of expression to go back from statements preserved through time and dispersed in space towards that interior secret that preceded them left its mark in them and in every sense of the term is betrayed by them Thus the nucleus of the initiating subjectivity is freed A subjectivity that always lags behind manifest history and which finds beneath events another more serious more secret more fundamental history closer to the origin more firmly linked to its ultimate horizon and consequently more in control of all its determinations This other history which runs beneath history constantly anticipating it and endlessly recollecting the past can be described  in a sociological or psychological way  as the evolution of mentalities it can be given a philosophical status in the recollection of the Logos or the teleology of reason lastly it can be purified in   137 the problematic of a trace which prior to all speech is the opening of inscription the gap of deferred time it is always the historicotranscendental theme that is reinvested A theme whose enunciative analysis tries to free itself In order to restore statements to their pure dispersion In order to analyse them in an exteriority that may be paradoxical since it refers to no adverse form of interiority In order to consider them in their discontinuity without having to relate them by one of those shifts that disconnect them and render them inessential to a more fundamental opening or difference In order to seize their very irruption at the place and at the moment at which it occurred In order to rediscover their occurrence as an event Perhaps we should speak of neutrality rather than exteriority but even this word implies rather too easily a suspension of belief an effacement or a placing in parentheses of all position of existence whereas it is a question of rediscovering that outside in which in their relative rarity in their incomplete proximity in their deployed space enunciative events are distributed  This task presupposes that the field of statements is not described as a translation of operations or processes that take place elsewhere in mens thought in their consciousness or unconscious in the sphere of transcendental constitutions but that it is accepted in its empirical modesty as the locus of particular events regularities relationships modifications and systematic transformations in short that it is treated not as the result or trace of something else but as a practical domain that is autonomous although dependent  and which can be described at its own level although it must be articulated on something other than itself  It also presupposes that this enunciative domain refers neither to an individual subject nor to some kind of collective consciousness nor to a transcendental subjectivity but that it is described as an anonymous field whose configuration defines the possible position of speaking subjects Statements should no longer be situated in relation to a sovereign subjectivity but recognize in the different forms of the speaking subjectivity effects proper to the enunciative field  138 As a result it presupposes that in its transformations in its successive series in its derivations the field of statements does not obey the temporality of the consciousness as its necessary model One must not hope  at least at this level and in this form of description  to be able to write a history of things said that is legitimately in its form in its regularity and in its nature the history of an individual or anonymous consciousness of a project of a system of intentions of a set of aims The time of discourse is not the translation in a visible chronology of the obscure time of thought  The analysis of statements operates therefore without reference to a cogito It does not pose the question of the speaking subject who reveals or who conceals himself in what he says who in speaking exercises his sovereign freedom or who without realizing it subjects himself to constraints of which he is only dimly aware In fact it is situated at the level of the it is said  and we must not understand by this a sort of communal opinion a collective representation that is imposed on every individual we must not understand by it a great anonymous voice that must of necessity speak through the discourses of everyone but we must understand by it the totality of things said the relations the regularities and the transformations that may be observed in them the domain of which certain figures certain intersections indicate the unique place of a speaking subject and may be given the name of author Anyone who speaks but what he says is not said from anywhere It is necessarily caught up in the play of an exteriority The third feature of enunciative analysis it is addressed to specific forms of accumulation that can be identified neither with an interiorization in the form of memory nor with an undiscriminating totalization of documents Usually when one analyses already existing discourses one regards them as having sprung from an essential inertia they have survived vived through chance or through the care with which men have treated them and the illusions that they have entertained as to their value and the immortal dignity of their words but now they are nothing more than written symbols piling up in dusty libraries slumbering in a sleep towards which they have never ceased to glide since the day they were pronounced since they were forgotten 139 and their visible effect lost in time At most they may be lucky enough to be picked up and examined in some chance reading at most they can discover that they bear the marks that refer back to the moment of their enunciation at most once these marks have been deciphered they can by a sort of memory that moves across time free meanings thoughts desires buried fantasies These four terms reading  trace  decipherment  memory however much importance one may accord to one or another of them and whatever the metaphorical extent that one may accord it and which enables it to embrace the other three define the system that usually makes it possible to snatch past discourse from its inertia and for a moment to rediscover something of its lost vitality Now the function of enunciative analysis is not to awaken texts from their present sleep and by reciting the marks still legible on their surface to rediscover the flash of their birth on the contrary its function is to follow them through their sleep or rather to take up the related themes of sleep oblivion and lost origin and to discover what mode of existence may characterize statements independently of their enunciation in the density of time in which they are preserved in which they are reactivated and used in which they are also  but this was not their original destiny  forgotten and possibly even destroyed  This analysis presupposes that statements are considered in the remanence remanence that is proper to them and which is not that of an everrealizable reference back to the past event of the formulation To say that statements are residual remanent is not to say that they remain in the field of memory or that it is possible to rediscover what they meant but it means that they are preserved by virtue of a number of supports and material techniques of which the book is of course only one example in accordance with certain types of institutions of which the library is one and with certain statutory modalities which are not the same in the case of a religious text a law or a scientific truth This also means that they are invested in techniques that put them into operation in practices that derive from them in the social relations that they form or through those relations modify Lastly it means that things do not have quite the same mode of existence the   140 same system of relations with their environment the same schemata of use the same possibilities of transformation once they have been said This survival in time is far from being the accidental or fortunate prolongation of an existence originally intended only for the moment on the contrary this remanence is of the nature of the statement oblivion and destruction are in a sense only the zero degree of this remanence And against the background that it constitutes the operations of memory can be deployed  This analysis also presupposes that statements are treated in the form of additivity that is specific to them In fact the types of grouping between successive statements are not always the same and they never proceed by a simple pilingup or juxtaposition of successive elements Mathematical statements are not added to one another in the same way as religious texts or laws they each have their own way of merging together annulling one another excluding one another complementing one another forming groups that are in varying degrees indissociable and endowed with unique properties Moreover these forms of additivity are not given once and for all and for a particular category of statements medical casehistory today forms a corpus of knowledge that does not obey the same laws of composition as medical casehistory in the eighteenth century modern mathematics does not accumulate its statements according to the same model as Euclidean geometry  Lastly enunciative analysis presupposes that one takes phenomena of recurrence into account Every statement involves a field of antecedent elements in relation to which it is situated but which it is able to reorganize and redistribute according to new relations It constitutes its own past defines in what precedes it its own filiation redefines what makes it possible or necessary excludes what cannot be compatible with it And it poses this enunciative past as an acquired truth as an event that has occurred as a form that can be modified as material to be transformed or as an object that can be spoken about etc In relation to all these possibilities of recurrence memory and oblivion the rediscovery of meaning or its repression far from being fundamental are merely unique figures 141 The description of statements and discursive formations must therefore free itself from the widespread and persistent image of return It does not claim to go back beyond a time that is no more than a falling off a latency an oblivion a covering up or a wandering towards that moment of foundation when speech was not yet caught up in any form of materiality when it had no chances of survival and when it was confined to the nondetermined dimension of the opening It does not try to constitute for the already said the paradoxical instant of the second birth it does not invoke a dawn about to return On the contrary it deals with statements in the density of the accumulation in which they are caught up and which nevertheless they never cease to modify to disturb to overthrow and sometimes to destroy To describe a group of statements not as the closed plethoric totality of a meaning but as an incomplete fragmented figure to describe a group of statements not with reference to the interiority of an intention a thought or a subject but in accordance with the dispersion of an exteriority to describe a group of statements in order to rediscover not the moment or the trace of their origin but the specific forms of an accumulation is certainly not to uncover an interpretation to discover a foundation or to free constituent acts nor is it to decide on a rationality or to embrace a teleology It is to establish what I am quite willing to call a positivity To analyse a discursive formation therefore is to deal with a group of verbal performances at the level of the statements and of the form of positivity that characterizes them or more briefly it is to define the type of positivity of a discourse If by substituting the analysis of rarity for the search for totalities the description of relations of exteriority for the theme of the transcendental foundation the analysis of accumulations for the quest of the origin one is a positivist then I am quite happy to be one Similarly I am not in the least unhappy about the fact that several times though still in a rather blind way I have used the term positivity to designate from afar the tangled mass that I was trying to unravel    142 5 THE HISTORICAL A PRIORI AND THE ARCHIVE The positivity of a discourse  like that of Natural History political economy or clinical medicine  characterizes its unity throughout time and well beyond individual oeuvres books and texts This unity certainly does not enable us to say of Linnaeus or Buffon Quesnay or Turgot Broussais or Bichat who told the truth who reasoned with rigour who most conformed to his own postulates nor does it enable us to say which of these oeuvres was closest to a primary or ultimate destination which would formulate most radically the general project of a science But what it does reveal is the extent to which Buffon and Linnaeus or Turgot and Quesnay Broussais and Bichat were talking about the same thing by placing themselves at the same level or at the same distance by deploying the same conceptual field by opposing one another on the same field of battle and it reveals on the other hand why one cannot say that Darwin is talking about the same thing as Diderot that Laennec continues the work of Van Swieten or that Jevons answers the Physiocrats It defines a limited space of communication A relatively small space since it is far from possessing the breadth of a science with all its historical development from its most distant origin to its present stage but a more extensive space than   143 the play of influences that have operated from one author to another or than the domain of explicit polemics Different oeuvres dispersed books that whole mass of texts that belong to a single discursive formation  and so many authors who know or do not know one another criticize one another invalidate one another pillage one another meet without knowing it and obstinately intersect their unique discourses in a web of which they are not the masters of which they cannot see the whole and of whose breadth they have a very inadequate idea  all these various figures and individuals do not communicate solely by the logical succession of propositions that they advance nor by the recurrence of themes nor by the obstinacy of a meaning transmitted forgotten and rediscovered they communicate by the form of positivity of their discourse or more exactly this form of positivity and the conditions of operation of the enunciative function defines a field in which formal identities thematic continuities translations of concepts and polemical interchanges may be deployed Thus positivity plays the role of what might be called a historical a priori Juxtaposed these two words produce a rather startling effect what I mean by the term is an a priori that is not a condition of validity for judgements but a condition of reality for statements It is not a question of rediscovering what might legitimize an assertion but of freeing the conditions of emergence of statements the law of their coexistence with others the specific form of their mode of being the principles according to which they survive become transformed and disappear An a priori not of truths that might never be said or really given to experience but the a priori of a history that is given since it is that of things actually said The reason for using this rather barbarous term is that this a priori must take account of statements in their dispersion in all the flaws opened up by their noncoherence in their overlapping and mutual replacement in their simultaneity which is not unifiable and in their succession which is not deductible in short it has to take account of the fact that discourse has not only a meaning or a truth but a history and a specific history that does not refer it back to the laws of an alien development It must show for example that the history of grammar is not the projection into the field of language and its problems of a history that is generally that of reason or of a particular mentality a history in any case that it shares with medicine   144 mechanical sciences or theology but that it involves a type of history  a form of dispersion in time a mode of succession of stability and of reactivation a speed of deployment or rotation  that belongs to it alone even if it is not entirely unrelated to other types of history Moreover this a priori does not elude historicity it does not constitute above events and in an unmoving heaven an atemporal structure it is defined as the group of rules that characterize a discursive practice but these rules are not imposed from the outside on the elements that they relate together they are caught up in the very things that they connect and if they are not modified with the least of them they modify them and are transformed with them into certain decisive thresholds The a priori of positivities is not only the system of a temporal dispersion it is itself a transformable group Opposed to formal a prioris whose jurisdiction extends without contingence there is a purely empirical figure but on the other hand since it makes it possible to grasp discourses in the law of their actual development it must be able to take account of the fact that such a discourse at a given moment may accept or put into operation or on the contrary exclude forget or ignore this or that formal structure It cannot take account by some kind of psychological or cultural genesis of the formal a prioris but it enables us to understand how the formal a prioris may have in history points of contact places of insertion irruption or emergence domains or occasions of operation and to understand how this history may be not an absolutely extrinsic contingence not a necessity of form deploying its own dialectic but a specific regularity Nothing therefore would be more pleasant or more inexact than to conceive of this historical a priori as a formal a priori that is also endowed with a history a great unmoving empty figure that irrupted one day on the surface of time that exercised over mens thought a tyranny that none could escape and which then suddenly disappeared in a totally unexpected totally unprecedented eclipse a transcendental syncopation a play of intermittent forms The formal a priori and the historical a priori neither belong to the same level nor share the same nature if they intersect it is because they occupy two different dimensions The domain of statements thus articulated in accordance with historical a prioris thus characterized by different types of positivity and   145 divided up by distinct discursive formations no longer has that appearance of a monotonous endless plain that I attributed to it at the outset when I spoke of the surface of discourse it also ceases to appear as the inert smooth neutral element in which there arise each according to its own movement or driven by some obscure dynamic themes ideas concepts knowledge We are now dealing with a complex volume in which heterogeneous regions are differentiated or deployed in accordance with specific rules and practices that cannot be superposed Instead of seeing on the great mythical book of history lines of words that translate in visible characters thoughts that were formed in some other time and place we have in the density of discursive practices systems that establish statements as events with their own conditions and domain of appearance and things with their own possibility and field of use They are all these systems of statements whether events or things that I propose to call archive By this term I do not mean the sum of all the texts that a culture has kept upon its person as documents attesting to its own past or as evidence of a continuing identity nor do I mean the institutions which in a given society make it possible to record and preserve those discourses that one wishes to remember and keep in circulation On the contrary it is rather the reason why so many things said by so many men for so long have not emerged in accordance with the same laws of thought or the same set of circumstances why they are not simply the signalization at the level of verbal performances of what could be deployed in the order of the mind or in the order of things but they appeared by virtue of a whole set of relations that are peculiar to the discursive level why instead of being adventitious figures grafted as it were in a rather haphazard way on to silent processes they are born in accordance with specific regularities in short why if there are things said  and those only  one should seek the immediate reason for them in the things that were said not in them nor in the men that said them but in the system of discursivity in the emmciative possibilities and impossibilites that it lays down The archive is first the law of what can be said the system that governs the appearance of statements as unique events But the archive is also that which determines that all these things said do not accumulate endlessly in an amorphous mass nor are they inscribed in an unbroken linearity nor   146 do they disappear at the mercy of chance external accidents but they are grouped together in distinct figures composed together in accordance with multiple relations maintained or blurred in accordance with specific regularities that which determines that they do not withdraw at the same pace in time but shine as it were like stars some that seem close to us shining brightly from afar off while others that are in fact close to us are already growing pale The archive is not that which despite its immediate escape safeguards the event of the statement and preserves for future memories its status as an escapee it is that which at the very root of the statementevent and in that which embodies it defines at the outset the system of its enunciability Nor is the archive that which collects the dust of statements that have become inert once more and which may make possible the miracle of their resurrection it is that which defines the mode of occurrence of the statementthing it is the system of its functioning Far from being that which unifies everything that has been said in the great confused murmur of a discourse far from being only that which ensures that we exist in the midst of preserved discourse it is that which differentiates discourses in their multiple existence and specifies them in their own duration Between the language langue that defines the system of constructing possible sentences and the corpus that passively collects the words that are spoken the archive defines a particular level that of a practice that causes a multiplicity of statements to emerge as so many regular events as so many things to be dealt with and manipulated It does not have the weight of tradition and it does not constitute the library of all libraries outside time and place nor is it the welcoming oblivion that opens up to all new speech the operational field of its freedom between tradition and oblivion it reveals the rules of a practice that enables statements both to survive and to undergo regular modification It is the general system of the formation and transformation of statements It is obvious that the archive of a society a culture or a civilization cannot be described exhaustively or even no doubt the archive of a whole period On the other hand it is not possible for us to describe our own archive since it is from within these rules that we speak since it is that which gives to what we can say  and to itself the object of our discourse  its modes of appearance its forms of existence and   147 coexistence its system of accumulation historicity and disappearance The archive cannot be described in its totality and in its presence it is unavoidable It emerges in fragments regions and levels more fully no doubt and with greater sharpness the greater the time that separates us from it at most were it not for the rarity of the documents the greater chronological distance would be necessary to analyse it And yet could this description of the archive be justified could it elucidate that which makes it possible map out the place where it speaks control its rights and duties test and develop its concepts  at least at this stage of the search when it can define its possibilities only in the moment of their realization  if it persisted in describing only the most distant horizons Should it not approach as close as possible to the positivity that governs it and the archive system that makes it possible today to speak of the archive in general Should it not illuminate if only in an oblique way that enunciative field of which it is itself a part The analysis of the archive then involves a privileged region at once close to us and different from our present existence it is the border of time that surrounds our presence which overhangs it and which indicates it in its otherness it is that which outside ourselves delimits us The description of the archive deploys its possibilities and the mastery of its possibilities on the basis of the very discourses that have just ceased to be ours its threshold of existence is established by the discontinuity that separates us from what we can no longer say and from that which falls outside our discursive practice it begins with the outside of our own language langage its locus is the gap between our own discursive practices In this sense it is valid for our diagnosis Not because it would enable us to draw up a table of our distinctive features and to sketch out in advance the face that we will have in the future But it deprives us of our continuities it dissipates that temporal identity in which we are pleased to look at ourselves when we wish to exorcise the discontinuities of history it breaks the thread of transcendental teleologies and where anthropological thought once questioned mans being or subjectivity it now bursts open the other and the outside In this sense the diagnosis does not establish the fact of our identity by the play of distinctions It establishes that we are difference that our reason is the difference of discourses our history the difference of times our selves the difference of masks That difference far from   148 being the forgotten and recovered origin is this dispersion that we are and make The never completed never wholly achieved uncovering of the archive forms the general horizon to which the description of discursive formations the analysis of positivities the mapping of the enunciative field belong The right of words  which is not that of the philologists  authorizes therefore the use of the term archaeology to describe all these searches This term does not imply the search for a beginning it does not relate analysis to geological excavation It designates the general theme of a description that questions the alreadysaid at the level of its existence of the enunciative function that operates within it of the discursive formation and the general archive system to which it belongs Archaeology describes discourses as practices specified in the element of the archive Part IV Archaeological Description 1 ARCHAEOLOGY AND THE HISTORY OF IDEAS  151 We can now reverse the procedure we can go downstream and once we have covered the domain of discursive formations and statements once we have outlined their general theory we can proceed to possible domains of application We can examine what use is served by this analysis that I have rather solemnly called archaeology Indeed we must for to be frank as they are at the moment things are rather disturbing I set out with a relatively simple problem the division of discourse into great unities that were not those of oeuvres authors books or themes And with the sole purpose of establishing them I have set about constructing a whole series of notions discursive formations positivity archive I have defined a domain statements the enunciative field discursive practices I have tried to reveal the specificity of a method that is neither formalizing nor interpretative in short I have appealed to a whole apparatus whose sheer weight and no doubt somewhat bizarre machinery are a source of embarrassment For two or three reasons there exist already enough methods for describing and analysing language langage for it not to be presumptuous to wish to add another And anyway I was suspicious of such unities of discourse as the book and the oeuvre because I suspected   152 them of not being as immediate and selfevident as they appeared is it reasonable to replace them by unities that one has established with so much effort after so much groping and in accordance with principles so obscure that it has taken hundreds of pages to elucidate them And are the things that all these instruments finally delimit those discourses whose identity they map out the same as those figures called psychiatry or political economy or Natural History for which I empirically set out and which have provided me with a pretext for developing this strange arsenal It is now of the utmost importance that I should measure the descriptive efficacy of the notions that I have tried to define I must discover whether the machine works and what it can produce What then can this archaeology offer that other descriptions are unable to provide What are the rewards for such a heavy enterprise And now a suspicion occurs to me I have behaved as if I were discovering a new domain as if in order to chart it I needed new measurements and guidelines But in fact was I not all the time in that very space that has long been known as the history of ideas Was it not to that space that I was implicitly referring even when on two or three occasions I tried to keep my distance And if I had not forced myself to turn away from it would I not have found in it already prepared already analysed all that I was looking for Perhaps I am a historian of ideas after all But an ashamed or if you prefer a presumptuous historian of ideas One who set out to renew his discipline from top to bottom who wanted no doubt to achieve a rigour that so many other similar descriptions have recently acquired but who unable to modify in any real way that old form of analysis to make it cross the threshold of scientificity or finding that such a metamorphosis is always impossible or that he did not have the strength to effect that transformation himself declares that he had been doing and wanted to do something quite different All this new fog just to hide what remained in the same landscape fixed to an old patch of ground cultivated to the point of exhaustion I cannot be satisfied until I have cut myself off from the history of ideas until I have shown in what way archaeological analysis differs from the descriptions of the history of ideas It is not easy to characterize a discipline like the history of ideas it is   153 an uncertain object with badly drawn frontiers methods borrowed from here and there and an approach lacking in rigour and stability And it seems to possess two roles On the one hand it recounts the byways and margins of history Not the history of the sciences but that of imperfect illbased knowledge which could never in the whole of its long persistent life attain the form of scientificity the history of alchemy rather than chemistry of animal spirits or phrenology rather than physiology the history of atomistic themes rather than physics The history of those shady philosophies that haunt literature art the sciences law ethics and even mans daily life the history of those ageold themes that are never crystallized in a rigorous and individual system but which have formed the spontaneous philosophy of those who did not philosophize The history not of literature but of that tangential rumour that everyday transient writing that never acquires the status of an oeuvre or is immediately lost the analysis of subliteratures almanacs reviews and newpapers temporary successes anonymous authors Thus defined  but one can see at once how difficult it is to fix precise limits for it  the history of ideas is concerned with all that insidious thought that whole interplay of representations that flow anonymously between men in the interstices of the great discursive monuments it reveals the crumbling soil on which they are based It is the discipline of fluctuating languages langages of shapeless works of unrelated themes The analysis of opinions rather than of knowledge of errors rather than of truth of types of mentality rather than of forms of thought But on the other hand the history of ideas sets out to cross the boundaries of existing disciplines to deal with them from the outside and to reinterpret them Rather than a marginal domain then it constitutes a style of analysis a putting into perspective It takes account of the historical field of the sciences of literature of philosophy but it describes the knowledge that has served as an empirical unreflective basis for subsequent formalizations it tries to rediscover the immediate experience that discourse transcribes it follows the genesis which on the basis of received or acquired representations gives birth to systems and ceuvres It shows on the other hand how the great figures that are built up in this way gradually decompose how the themes fall apart pursue their isolated lives fall into disuse or are recomposed in a new   154 way The history of ideas then is the discipline of beginnings and ends the description of obscure continuities and returns the reconstitution of developments in the linear form of history But it can also by that very fact describe from one domain to another the whole interplay of exchanges and intermediaries it shows how scientific knowledge is diffused gives rise to philosophical concepts and takes form perhaps in literary works it shows how problems notions themes may emigrate from the philosophical field where they were formulated to scientific or political discourses it relates work with institutions social customs or behaviour techniques and unrecorded needs and practices it tries to revive the most elaborate forms of discourse in the concrete landscape in the midst of the growth and development that witnessed their birth It becomes therefore the discipline of interferences the description of the concentric circles that surround works underline them relate them to one another and insert them into whatever they are not It is clear how these two roles of the history of ideas are articulated one upon the other In its most general form it can be said that it continually describes  and in all the directions in which it operates  the transition from nonphilosophy to philosophy from nonscientificity to science from nonliterature to the uvre itself It is the analysis of silent births or distant correspondences of permanences that persist beneath apparent changes of slow formations that profit from innumerable blind complicities of those total figures that gradually come together and suddenly condense into the fine point of the work Genesis continuity totalization these are the great themes of the history of ideas and that by which it is attached to a certain now traditional form of historical analysis In these conditions it is normal that anyone who still practises history its methods its requirements and possibilities  this now rather shopsoiled idea  cannot conceive that a discipline like the history of ideas should be abandoned or rather considers that any other form of analysing discourses is a betrayal of history itself But archaeological description is precisely such an abandonment of the history of ideas a systematic rejection of its postulates and procedures an attempt to practise a quite different history of what men have said That some people do not recognize in this enterprise the history of their   155 childhood that they mourn its passing and continue to invoke in an age that is no longer made for it that great shade of former times certainly proves their fidelity But such conservative zeal confirms me in my purpose and gives me the confidence to do what I set out to do Between archaeological analysis and the history of ideas there are a great many points of divergence I shall try shortly to establish four differences that seem to me to be of the utmost importance They concern the attribution of innovation the analysis of contradictions comparative descriptions and the mapping of transformations I hope that by examining these different points we will be able to grasp the specific qualities of archaeological analysis and that we may be able to measure its descriptive capacity For the moment however I should like to lay down a few principles  1Archaeology tries to define not the thoughts representations images themes preoccupations that are concealed or revealed in discourses but those discourses themselves those discourses as practices obeying certain rules It does not treat discourse as document as a sign of something else as an element that ought to be transparent but whose unfortunate opacity must often be pierced if one is to reach at last the depth of the essential in the place in which it is held in reserve it is concerned with discourse in its own volume as a monument It is not an interpretative discipline it does not seek another betterhidden discourse It refuses to be allegorical  2Archaeology does not seek to rediscover the continuous insensible transition that relates discourses on a gentle slope to what precedes them surrounds them or follows them It does not await the moment when on the basis of what they were not yet they became what they are nor the moment when the solidity of their figure crumbling away they will gradually lose their identity On the contrary its problem is to define discourses in their specificity to show in what way the set of rules that they put into operation is irreducible to any other to follow them the whole length of their exterior ridges in order to underline them the better It does not proceed in slow progression from the confused field of opinion to the uniqueness of the   156 system or the definitive stability of science it is not a doxology but a differential analysis of the modalities of discourse 3Archaeology is not ordered in accordance with the sovereign figure of the oeuvres it does not try to grasp the moment in which the oeuvre emerges on the anonymous horizon It does not wish to rediscover the enigmatic point at which the individual and the social are inverted into one another It is neither a psychology nor a sociology nor more generally an anthropology of creation The oeuvre is not for archaeology a relevant division even if it is a matter of replacing it in its total context or in the network of causalities that support it It defines types of rules for discursive practices that run through individual oeuvres sometimes govern them entirely and dominate them to such an extent that nothing eludes them but which sometimes too govern only part of it The authority of the creative subject as the raison detre of an oeuvre and the principle of its unity is quite alien to it 4Lastly archaeology does not try to restore what has been thought wished aimed at experienced desired by men in the very moment at which they expressed it in discourse it does not set out to recapture that elusive nucleus in which the author and the oeuvre exchange identities in which thought still remains nearest to oneself in the as yet unaltered form of the same and in which language langage has not yet been deployed in the spatial successive dispersion of discourse In other words it does not try to repeat what has been said by reaching it in its very identity It does not claim to efface itself in the ambiguous modesty of a reading that would bring back in all its purity the distant precarious almost effaced light of the origin It is nothing more than a rewriting that is in the preserved form of exteriority a regulated transformation of what has already been written It is not a return to the innermost secret of the origin it is the systematic description of a discourseobject   157 2 THE ORIGINAL And THE REGULAR In general the history of ideas deals with the field of discourses as a domain with two values any element located there may be characterized as old or new traditional or original conforming to an average type or deviant One can distinguish therefore between two categories of formulation those that are highly valued and relatively rare which appear for the first time which have no similar antecedents which may serve as models for others and which to this extent deserve to be regarded as creations and those ordinary everyday solid that are not responsible for themselves and which derive sometimes going so far as to repeat it word for word from what has already been said To each of these two groups the history of ideas gives a status and it does not subject them to the same analysis in describing the first it recounts the history of inventions changes transformations it shows how truth freed itself from error how consciousness awoke from its successive slumbers how new forms rose up in turn to produce the landscape that we know today it is the task of the historian to rediscover on the basis of these isolated points these successive ruptures the continuous line of an evolution The second group on the other hand reveals history as inertia and weight as a slow accumulation of the past a silent   158 sedimentation of things said in this second group statements must he treated by weight and in accordance with what they have in common their unique occurrence may be neutralized the importance of their authors identity the time and place of their appearance are also diminished on the other hand it is their extent that must be measured the extent of their repetition in time and place the channels by which they are diffused the groups in which they circulate the general horizon that they outline for mens thought the limits that they impose on it and how in characterizing a period they make it possible to distinguish it from others one then describes a series of overall figures In the first case the history of ideas describes a succession of events in thought in the second there are uninterrupted expanses of effects in the first one reconstitutes the emergence of truths of forms in the second one reestablishes forgotten solidities and refers discourses to their relativity It is true that between these two authorities the history of ideas is continuously determining relations neither analysis is ever found in its pure state it describes conflicts between the old and the new the resistance of the acquired the repression that it exercises over what has so far never been said the coverings by which it masks it the oblivion to which it sometimes succeeds in confining it but it also describes the conditions which obscurely and at a distance will facilitate the emergence of future discourses it describes the repercussions of discoveries the speed and extent of their diffusion the slow processes of replacement or the sudden upheavals that overthrow familiar language langage it describes the integration of the new in the already structured field of the acquired the progressive fall from the original into the traditional or again the reappearances of the alreadysaid and the uncovering of the original But this intersection does not prevent it from always maintaining a bipolar analysis of the old and the new An analysis that reinvests in the empirical element of history and in each of its stages the problematic of the origin in every uvre in every hook in the smallest text the problem is to rediscover the point of rupture to establish with the greatest possible precision the division between the implicit density of the alreadysaid a perhaps involuntary fidelity to acquired opinion the law of discursive fatalities and the vivacity of creation the leap into irreducible difference Although this description  159 of originalities may seem obvious enough it poses two very different methodological problems that of resemblance and that of procession It presupposes in effect that one can establish a sort of single great series in which every formulation would assume a date in accordance with homogeneous chronological guidelines But to examine the question more closely does Grimm with his law of vowelgradations precede Bopp who quoted him used him applied and modified what he said in the same way and on the same temporal line and did Cceurdoux and AnquetilDuperron in observing analogies between Greek and Sanskrit anticipate the definition of the IndoEuropean languages and precede the founders of comparative grammar Was Saussure preceded by Peirce and his semiotics by Arnauld and Lancelot with the Classical analysis of the sign and by the Stoics and the theory of the signifier in the same series and in accordance with the same mode of anteriority Precession is not an irreducible and primary donnee it cannot play the role of an absolute measure that makes it possible to gauge all discourse and to distinguish the original from the repetitive The mapping of antecedents is not enough in itself to determine a discursive order on the contrary it is subordinated to the discourse that one is analysing at the level that one chooses on the scale that one establishes By deploying discourse throughout a calendar and by giving a date to each of its elements one does not obtain a definitive hierarchy of precessions and originalities this hierarchy is never more than relative to the systems of discourse that it sets out to evaluate Similarly the resemblance between two or several successive formulations also poses a whole series of problems In what sense and in accordance with what criteria can one affirm this has been said the same thing can already he found in this or that text etc What is identity partial or total in the order of discourse The fact that two enunciations are exactly identical that they are made up of the same words used with the same meaning does not as we know mean that they are absolutely identical Even when one finds in the work of Diderot and Lamarck or of Benoit de Maillet and Darwin the same formulation of the principle of evolution one cannot consider that one is dealing in each case with the same discursive event which has been subjected at different times to a series of repetitions Identity is not a 160 criterion even when it is exhaustive even less so when it is partial when words are not used each time in the same sense or when the same nucleus of meaning is apprehended through different words to what extent can one affirm that it is the same organicist theme that emerges in the so very different discourses and vocabularies of Buffon Jussieu and Cuvier And inversely can one say that the word organization has the same meaning in the work of Daubenton Blumenbach and Geoffroy SaintHilaire Generally speaking does one find the same type of resemblance between Cuvier and Darwin and between Cuvier and Linnaeus or Aristotle There is no immediately recognizable resemblance between the formulations their analogy is an effect of the discursive field in which it is mapped It is not legitimate then to demand pointblank of the texts that one is studying their title to originality and whether they really possess those degrees of nobility that are measured here by the absence of ancestors The question can have meaning only in very precisely defined series in groups whose limits and domain have been established between guidelines that delimit sufficiently homogeneous discursive fields But to seek in the great accumulation of the alreadysaid the text that resembles in advance a later text to ransack history in order to rediscover the play of anticipations or echoes to go right back to the first seeds or to go forward to the last traces to reveal in a work its fidelity to tradition or its irreducible uniqueness to raise or lower its stock of originality to say that the PortRoyal grammarians invented nothing or to discover that Cuvier had more predecessors than one thought these are harmless enough amusements for historians who refuse to grow up Archaeological description is concerned with those discursive practices to which the facts of succession must be referred if one is not to establish them in an unsystematic and naive way that is in terms of merit At the level in which they are the originalitybanality opposition is therefore not relevant between an initial formulation and the sentence which years centuries later repeats it more or less exactly it establishes no hierarchy of value it makes no radical difference It tries It was in this way that M Canguilhem established the series of propositions which from Willis to Prochaska made possible the definition of the reflex 161 only to establish the regularity of statements In this sense regularity is not in opposition to irregularity which in the margins of current opinion or the most frequent texts characterizes the deviant statement abnormal prophetic retarded pathological or the product of genius it designates for every verbal performance extraordinary or banal unique in its own kind or endlessly repeated the set of conditions in which the enunciative function operates and which guarantees and defines its existence In this sense regularity does not characterize a certain central position between the ends of a statistical curve  it is not valid therefore as an index of frequency or probability it specifies an effective field of appearance Every statement bears a certain regularity and it cannot be dissociated from it One must not therefore oppose the regularity of a statement with the irregularity of another that may he less expected more unique richer in innovation but to other regularities that characterize other statements Archaeology is not in search of inventions and it remains unmoved at the moment a very moving one I admit when for the first time someone was sure of some truth it does not try to restore the light of those joyful mornings But neither is it concerned with the average phenomena of opinion with the dull grey of what everyone at a particular period might repeat What it seeks in the texts of Linnaeus or Buffon Petty or Ricardo Pinel or Bichat is not to draw up a list of founding saints it is to uncover the regularity of a discursive practice A practice that is in operation in the same way in the work of their predecessors a practice that takes account in their work not only of the most original affirmations those that no one else dreamt of before them but also of those that they borrowed even copied from their predecessors A discovery is no less regular from the enunciative point of view than the text that repeats and diffuses it regularity is no less operant no less effective and active in a banal as in a unique formation In such a description one cannot admit a difference in nature between creative statements which reveal something new which emit hitherto unknown information and which are active in the same way and imitative statements which receive and repeat information and remain as it were passive The field of statements is not a group of inert areas broken up by fecund moments it is a domain that is active throughout 162 This analysis of enunciative regularities opens up in several directions that one day perhaps will be explored with greater care  1 A group of statements is characterized then by a certain form of regularity without it being either necessary or possible to distinguish between what is new and what is not But these regularities  we shall come hack to them later  are not given once and for all the same regularity is not to be found at work in Tournefort and Darwin Lancelot and Saussure Petty and Keynes There are then homogeneous fields of enunciative regularities they characterize a discursive formation but these fields are different from one another The movement from one field of enunciative regularities to another need not be accompanied by corresponding changes at all other levels of discourse There are verbal performances that are identical from the point of view of grammar vocabulary syntax and the language langue in general that are also identical from the point of view of logic from the point of view of propositional structure or of the deductive system in which it is placed  but which are enunciatively different Thus the formation of the quantitative relation between prices and monetary mass in circulation may be expressed in the same words  or synonymous words  and be obtained by the same reasoning but it is not enunciatively identical in Gresham or Locke and the nineteenthcentury marginalists it does not belong in each case to the same system of formation of objects and concepts We must distinguish then between linguistic analogy or translatability logical identity or equivalence and enunciative homogeneity It is with these homogeneities and these alone that archaeology is concerned It can see the appearance of a new discursive practice through verbal formulations that remain linguistically analogous or logically equivalent by taking up again sometimes word for word the old theory of sentenceattribution and verbcopula the PortRoyal grammarians opened up an enunciative regularity whose specificity it is the duty of archaeology to describe Inversely it may ignore differences of vocabulary it may pass over semantic fields or different deductive organizations if it is capable of recognizing in each case despite their heterogeneity a certain enunciative regularity from this point of view the theory of the language langage of action the search for the origin of languages longues the establishment of primitive 163 roots as they are found in the eighteenth century are not new in relation to Lancelots logical analyses One can see the emergence therefore of a number of disconnexions and articulations One can no longer say that a discovery the formulation of a general principle or the definition of a project inaugurates in a massive way a new phase in the history of discourse One no longer has to seek that point of absolute origin or total revolution on the basis of which everything is organized everything becomes possible and necessary everything is effaced in order to begin again One is dealing with events of different types and levels caught up in distinct historical webs the establishment of an enunciative homogeneity in no way implies that for decades or centuries to come men will say and think the same thing nor does it imply the definition explicit or not of a number of principles from which everything else would flow as inevitable consequences Enunciative homogeneities and heterogeneities intersect with linguistic continuities and changes with logical identities and differences without any of them proceeding at the same pace or necessarily affecting one another But there must exist between them a number of relations and interdependences whose no doubt highly complex domain must be described  2 Another direction of research the interior hierarchies within enunciative regularities We have seen that every statement belongs to a certain regularity  that consequently none can be regarded as pure creation as the marvellous disorder of genius But we have also seen that no statement can be regarded as inactive and be valid as the scarcely real shadow or transfer of the initial statement The whole enunciative field is both regular and alerted it never sleeps the least statement  the most discreet or the most banal  puts into operation a whole set of rules in accordance with which its object its modality the concepts that it employs and the strategy of which it is a part are formed These rules are never given in a formulation they traverse formulations and set up for them a space of coexistence one cannot therefore rediscover the unique statement that would articulate them for themselves However certain groups of statements put these rules into operation in their most general and most widely applicable form  164 using them as a startingpoint one can see how other objects other concepts other enunciative modalities or other strategic choices may be formed on the basis of rules that are less general and whose domain of application is more specified One can thus describe a tree of enunciative derivation at its base are the statements that put into operation rules of formation in their most extended form at its summit and after a number of branchings are the statements that put into operation the same regularity but one more delicately articulated more clearly delimited and localized in its extension Archaeology  and this is one of its principal themes  may thus constitute the tree of derivation of a discourse That of Natural History for example It will place at the root as governing statements those that concern the definition of observable structures and the field of possible objects those that prescribe the forms of description and the perceptual codes that it can use those that reveal the most general possibilities of characterization and thus open up a whole domain of concepts to be constructed and lastly those that while constituting a strategic choice leave room for the greatest number of subsequent options And it will find at the ends of the branches or at various places in the whole a burgeoning of discoveries like that of fossil series conceptual transformations like the new definition of the genus the emergence of new notions like that of mammals or organism technical improvements principles for organizing collections methods of classification and nomenclature This derivation from governing statements must not be confused with a deduction that is made on the basis of axioms nor must it be identified with the germination of a general idea or a philosophical nucleus whose significance emerges gradually in experience or precise conceptualizations lastly it must not he taken as a psychological genesis based on a discovery whose consequences and possibilities gradually develop and unfold It is different from all these courses and it must be described in its autonomy One can thus describe the archaeological derivations of Natural History without beginning with its undemonstrable axioms or its fundamental themes the continuity of nature for example and without taking as ones startingpoint and guidingthread the first discoveries or the first approaches those of Tournefort before those of Linnaeus those of Jonston before those of Tournefort The archaeo  165 logical order is neither that of systematici ties nor that of chronological successions But one can see that a whole domain of possible questions is opening up here For these different orders cannot be specific and autonomous there must be relations and dependences between them For certain discursive formations the archaeological order is perhaps not very different from the systematic order as in other cases it may follow the thread of chronological successions These parallelisms contrary to the distortions met with elsewhere are worthy of analysis In any case it is important not to confuse these different orders not to seek in an initial discovery or in the originality of a formulation the principle from which everything can be deduced and derived not to seek in a general principle the law of enunciative regularities or individual inventions not to demand of archaeological derivation that it reproduce the order of time or reveal a deductive schema  Nothing would be more false than to see in the analysis of discursive formations an attempt at totalitarian periodization whereby from a certain moment and for a certain time everyone would think in the same way in spite of surface differences say the same thing through a polymorphous vocabulary and produce a sort of great discourse that one could travel over in any direction On the contrary archaeology describes a level of enunciative homogeneity that has its own temporal articulations and which does not carry with it all the other forms of identity and difference that are to be found in language and at this level it establishes an order hierarchies a whole burgeoning that excludes a massive amorphous synchrony given totally once and for all In those confused unities that we call periods it reveals with all their specificity enunciative periods that are articulated but without being confused with them upon the time of concepts on theoretical phases on stages of formalization and of linguistic development   166 3 CONTRADICTIONS The history of ideas usually credits the discourse that it analyses with coherence If it happens to notice an irregularity in the use of words several incompatible propositions a set of meanings that do not adjust to one another concepts that cannot be systematized together then it regards it as its duty to find at a deeper level a principle of cohesion that organizes the discourse and restores to it its hidden unity This law of coherence is a heuristic rule a procedural obligation almost a moral constraint of research not to multiply contradictions uselessly not to be taken in by small differences not to give too much weight to changes disavowals returns to the past and polemics not to suppose that mens discourse is perpetually undermined from within by the contradiction of their desires the influences that they have been subjected to or the conditions in which they live but to admit that if they speak and if they speak among themselves it is rather to overcome these contradictions and to find the point from which they will be able to be mastered But this same coherence is also the result of research it defines the terminal unities that complete the analysis it discovers the internal organization of a text the form of development of an individual oeuvre or the meetingplace of different discourses In order to reconstitute it it must first be presupposed and one will only be sure of finding it if one has pursued it far enough and for long enough It 167 appears as an optimum the greatest possible number of contradictions resolved by the simplest means But a great many means are used and by that very fact the coherences found may differ considerably By analysing the truth of propositions and the relations that unite them one can define a field of logical noncontradiction one will then discover a systematicity one will rise from the visible body of sentences to that pure ideal architecture that the ambiguities of grammar and the overloading of words with meanings have probably concealed as much as expressed But one can adopt the contrary course and by following the thread of analogies and symbols rediscover a thematic that is more imaginary than discursive more affective than rational and less close to the concept than to desire its force animates the most opposed figures but only to melt them at once into a slowly transformable unity what one then discovers is a plastic continuity the movement of a meaning that is embodied in various representations images and metaphors These coherences may be thematic or systematic explicit or not they can be sought at the level of representations that were conscious in the speaking subject but which his discourse  for circumstantial reasons or because of an inadequacy in the very form of his language langage  failed to express it can also be sought in structures that would have constrained the author the more he constructed them and which would have imposed on him without his realizing it postulates operational schemata linguistic rules a set of affirmations and fundamental beliefs types of images or a whole logic of the fantastic Lastly there are coherences that one establishes at the level of an individual  his biography or the unique circumstances of his discourse  but one can also establish them in accordance with broader guidelines one can give them the collective diachronic dimensions of a period a genera form of consciousness a type of society a set of traditions an imaginary landscape common to a whole culture In all these forms a coherence discovered in this way always plays the same role it shows that immediately visible contradictions are merely surface reflections and that this play of dispersed light must be concentrated into a single focus Contradiction is the illusion of a unity that hides itself or is hidden it has its place only in the gap between consciousness and unconsciousness thought and the text the ideality and the contingent 168 body of expression In any case analysis must suppress contradiction as best it can At the end of this work only residual contradictions remain  accidents defects mistakes  or on the contrary as if the entire analysis had been carried out in secrecy and in spite of itself the fundamental contradiction emerges the bringing into play at the very origin of the system of incompatible postulates intersections of irreconcilable influences the first diffraction of desire the economic and political conflict that opposes a society to itself all this instead of appearing as so many superficial elements that must be reduced is finally revealed as an organizing principle as the founding secret law that accounts for all minor contradictions and gives them a firm foundation in short a model for all the other oppositions Such a contradiction far from being an appearance or accident of discourse far from being that from which it must be freed if its truth is at last to be revealed constitutes the very law of its existence it is on the basis of such a contradiction that discourse emerges and it is in order both to translate it and to overcome it that discourse begins to speak it is in order to escape that contradiction whereas contradiction is ceaselessly reborn through discourse that discourse endlessly pursues itself and endlessly begins again it is because contradiction is always anterior to the discourse and because it can never therefore entirely escape it that discourse changes undergoes transformation and escapes of itself from its own continuity Contradiction then functions throughout discourse as the principle of its historicity The history of ideas recognizes therefore two levels of contradiction that of appearances which is resolved in the profound unity of discourse and that of foundations which gives rise to discourse itself In relation to the first level of contradiction discourse is the ideal figure that must be separated from their accidental presence from their too visible body in relation to the second discourse is the empirical figure that contradictions may take up and whose apparent cohesion must be destroyed in order to rediscover them at last in their irruption and violence Discourse is the path from one contradiction to another if it gives rise to those that can be seen it is because it obeys that which it hides To analyse discourse is to hide and reveal contradictions it is to show the play that they set up within it it is to manifest   169 how it can express them embody them or give them a temporary appearance For archaeological analysis contradictions are neither appearances to be overcome nor secret principles to be uncovered They are objects to be described for themselves without any attempt being made to discover from what point of view they can be dissipated or at what level they can be radicalized and effects become causes Let us take a simple example one that has already been mentioned several times in the eighteenth century Linnaeuss fixist principle was contradicted not so much by the discovery of the Peloria which changed only its modes of application but by a number of evolutionist affirmations that are to be found in the works of Buffon Diderot Bordeu Maillet and many others Archaeological analysis does not consist in showing that beneath this opposition at a more essential level everyone accepted a number of fundamental theses the continuity and plenitude of nature the correlation between recent forms and climate the almost imperceptible transition from the nonliving to the living nor does it consist in showing that such an opposition reflects in the particular domain of Natural History a more general conflict that divides all eighteenthcentury knowledge and thought the conflict between the theme of an ordered creation acquired once and for all deployed without irreducible secret and the theme of a prolific nature endowed with enigmatic powers gradually deploying itself through history and overturning all spatial orders in obedience to the onward thrust of time Archaeology tries to show how the two affirmations fixist and evolutionist share a common locus in a certain description of species and genera this description takes as its object the visible structure of organs that is their form size number and arrangement in space and it can limit that object in two ways to the organism as a whole or to certain elements determined either by importance or by taxonomic convenience one then reveals in the second case a regular table containing a number of definite squares that in a way constitutes the programme of all possible creation so that whether present still to come or already disappeared the ordering of the species and genera is definitively fixed  and in the first case groups of kinship that remain indefinite and open that are separated from one another and that tolerate an indeterminate number of new forms however close they   170 may be to preexisting forms By deriving in this way the contradiction between two theses from a certain domain of objects from its delimitations and divisions one does not discover a point of conciliation But neither does one transfer it to a more fundamental level one defines the locus in which it takes place it reveals the place where the two branches of the alternative join it localizes the divergence and the place where the two discourses are juxtaposed The theory of structure is not a common postulate a basis of general belief shared by Linnaeus and Buffon a solid fundamental affirmation that throws back to the level of a subsidiary debate the conflict of evolutionism and fixism it is the principle of their incompatibility the law that governs their derivation and their coexistence By taking contradictions as objects to be described archaeological analysis does not try to discover in their place a common form or theme it tries to determine the extent and form of the gap that separates them In relation to a history of ideas that attempts to melt contradictions in the seminocturnal unity of an overall figure or which attempts to transmute them into a general abstract uniform principle of interpretation or explanation archaeology describes the different spaces of dissension It ceases therefore to treat contradictions as a general function operating in the same way at all levels of discourse and which analysis should either suppress entirely or lead back to a primary constitutive form for the great game of contradiction  present under innumerable guises then suppressed and finally restored in the major conflict in which it culminates  it substitutes the analysis of different types of contradiction different levels in accordance with which it can be mapped different functions that it can exercise Different types first of all Some contradictions are localized only at the level of propositions and assertions without in any way affecting the body of enunciative rules that makes them possible thus in the eighteenth century the thesis of the animal character of fossils was opposed by the more traditional thesis of their mineral nature the consequences that can be drawn from these two theses are certainly very numerous and farreaching but it can be shown that they originated in the same discursive formation at the same point and in accordance with the same conditions of operation of the enunciative function they are contradictions that are archaeologically derived and 171 which constitute a terminal state Others on the contrary go beyond the bounds of a discursive formation and they oppose theses that do not belong to the same conditions of enunciation thus Linnaeuss fixism is contradicted by Darwins evolutionism but only to the extent that one neutralizes the difference between Natural History to which the first belongs and biology to which the second belongs They are extrinsic contradictions that reflect the opposition between distinct discursive formations For archaeological description ignoring for the moment any possible procedural differences this opposition constitutes the terminus a quo whereas derived contradictions constitute the terminus ad quem of analysis Between these two extremes archaeological description describes what might be called intrinsic contradictions those that are deployed in the discursive formation itself and which originating at one point in the system of formations reveal subsystems hence to keep to the example of eighteenthcentury Natural History the contradiction between methodical analyses and systematic analyses The opposition here is not a terminal one they are not two contradictory propositions about the same object they are not two incompatible uses of the same concept but two ways of forming statements both characterized by certain objects certain positions of subjectivity certain concepts and certain strategic choices Yet these systems are not primary ones for it can be shown to what extent they both derive from a single positivity that of Natural History It is these intrinsic oppositions that are relevant to archaeological analysis Then different levels An intrinsic archaeological contradiction is not a fact purely and simply that it is enough to state as a principle or explain as an effect It is a complex phenomenon that is distributed over different levels of the discursive formation Thus for systematic Natural History and methodical Natural History which were in constant opposition for a good part of the eighteenth century one can recognize an inadequation of the objects in the one case one describes the general appearance of the plant in the other certain predetermined variables in the one case one describes the totality of the plant or at least its most important parts in the other one describes a number of elements chosen arbitrarily for their taxonomic convenience sometimes one takes account of the plants different states of growth and maturity at others one confines ones attention to a single moment a   172 stage of optimum visibility a divergence of enunciative modalities in the case of the systematic analysis of plants one applies a rigorous perceptual and linguistic code and in accordance with a constant scale for methodical description the codes are relatively free and the scales of mapping may oscillate an incompatibility of concepts in the systems the concept of generic character is an arbitrary though misleading mark to designate the genera in the methods this same concept must include the real definition of the genus lastly an exclusion of theoretical options systematic taxonomy makes fixism possible even if it is rectified by the idea of a continuous creation in time gradually unfolding the elements of the tables or by the idea of natural catastrophes having disturbed by our present gaze the linear order of natural proximities but excludes the possibility of a transformation that the method accepts without absolutely implying it Functions These forms of opposition do not all play the same role in discursive practice they are not in a homogeneous way obstacles to overcome or a principle of growth In any case it is not enough to seek in them the cause either of the deceleration or the acceleration of history time is not introduced into the truth and ideality of discourse on the basis of the empty general form of opposition These oppositions are always particular functional stages Some of them bring about an additional development of the enunciative field they open up sequences of argumentation experiment verification and various inferences they make possible the determination of new objects they arouse new enunciative modalities they define new concepts or modify the field of application of those that already exist but without anything being modified in the system of positivity of the discourse this was the case in the discussions of the eighteenthcentury naturalists on the frontier between the mineral and the vegetal or on the boundaries of life or nature and the origin of fossils such additive processes may remain decisively open or closed by a demonstration that refutes them or a discovery that puts them out of operation Others induce a reorganization of the discursive field they pose the question of the possible translation of one group of statements into another of the point of coherence that might articulate one on another of their integration in a more general space thus the systemmethod opposition among eighteenthcentury naturalists induces a series of attempts to recreate both of them in a 173 single form of description to give to the method the rigour and regularity of the system to coincide the arbitrariness of the system with the concrete analyses of the method they are not new objects new concepts new enunciative modalities that are added in a linear fashion to the old but objects of another more general or more particular level concepts that have another structure and another field of application enunciations of another type without however altering the rules of formation Other oppositions play a critical role they put into operation the existence of the acceptability of the discursive practice they define the point of its effective impossibility and of its historical reflexion thus the description in Natural History itself of organic similarities and functions that operate through anatomical variables in definite conditions of existence no longer permits as an autonomous discursive formation at least a Natural History that is a taxonomic science of beings on the basis of their visible characters A discursive formation is not therefore an ideal continuous smooth text that runs beneath the multiplicity of contradictions and resolves them in the calm unity of coherent thought nor is it the surface in which in a thousand different aspects a contradiction is reflected that is always in retreat but everywhere dominant It is rather a space of multiple dissensions a set of different oppositions whose levels and roles must be described Archaeological analysis then erects the primacy of a contradiction that has its model in the simultaneous affirmation and negation of a single proposition But the reason for this is not to even out oppositions in the general forms of thought and to pacify them by force by a recourse to a constructing a priori On the contrary its purpose is to map in a particular discursive practice the point at which they are constituted to define the form that they assume the relations that they have with each other and the domain that they govern In short its purpose is to maintain discourse in all its many irregularities and consequently to suppress the theme of a contradiction uniformly lost and rediscovered resolved and forever rising again in the undifferentiated element of the Logos  174   4 THE COMPARATIVE FACTS Archaeological analysis individualizes and describes discursive formations That is it must compare them oppose them to one another in the simultaneity in which they are presented distinguish them from those that do not belong to the same timescale relate them on the basis of their specificity to the nondiscursive practices that surround them and serve as a general element for them In this too they are very different from epistemological or architectonic descriptions which analyse the internal structure of a theory archaeological study is always in the plural it operates in a great number of registers it crosses interstices and gaps it has its domain where unities are juxtaposed separated fix their crests confront one another and accentuate the whitespaces between one another When it is concerned with a particular type of discourse that of psychiatry in Madness and Civilization or that of medicine in Naissance de la clinique it is in order to establish by comparison its chronological limits it is also in order to describe at the same time as them and in correlation with them an institutional field a set of events practices and political decisions a sequence of economic processes that also involve demographic fluctuations techniques of public assistance manpower needs different levels of unemployment etc But it may also by a sort of lateral rapprochement as in The Order of Things put into operation several distinct positivities   175 whose concomitant states are compared during a particular period and which are confronted with other types of discourse that have taken place at a given period But all these analyses are very different from those usually practised  1 In archaeological analysis comparison is always limited and regional Far from wishing to reveal general forms archaeology tries to outline particular configurations When one compares General Grammar the Analysis of Wealth and Natural History in the Classical period it is not in order to regroup three manifestations  particularly charged with expressive value and hitherto strangely neglected  of a mentality that was general in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries it is not in order to reconstitute on the basis of a reduced model and a particular domain the forms of rationality that operated in the whole of Classical science it is not even to illuminate the less wellknown profile of what we thought was a familiar cultural face Our aim was not to show that men in the eighteenth century were generally speaking more interested in order than in history in classification than development in signs than the mechanisms of causality Our aim was to reveal a welldetermined set of discursive formations that have a number of describable relations between them These relations do not spill over into adjacent domains and they cannot be brought gradually closer to the totality of contemporary discourses even less to what is usually called the Classical spirit they are closely confined to the triad being studied and are valid only in the domain specified This interdiscursive group is itself in its group form related to other types of discourse with the analysis of representation the general theory of signs and ideology on the one hand and with mathematics algebraic analysis and the attempt to establish a mathesis on the other They are those internal and external relations that characterize Natural History the Analysis of Wealth and General Grammar as a specific group and make it possible to recognize in them an interdiscursive configuration There are those who would say Why did you not speak of cosmology physiology or Biblical exegesis Could not preLavoisier chemistry or Eulers mathematics or Vicos history have invalidated all the analyses to be found in The Order of Things Are there not in the inventive richness of the eighteenth century many other ideas that do not fit into   176 the rigid framework of archaeology To such people with their quite legitimate impatience to all the counterexamples which as I am very well aware they could supply I will reply of course I not only admit that my analysis is limited I want it so I have made it so What for me would he a counterexample would be precisely the possibility of saying all these relations that you have described in three particular formations all these networks in which the theories of attribution articulation designation and derivation are articulated upon one another all that taxonomy that rests on a discontinuous characterization and a continuity of order are found uniformly and in the same way in geometry rational mechanics the physiology of humours and germs Biblical criticism and emergent crystallography This would in fact prove that I did not describe as I claimed to have done a region of interpositivity I would have characterized the spirit or science of a period  the very thing to which my whole enterprise is opposed The relations that I have described are valid in order to define a particular configuration they are not signs to describe the face of a culture in its totality It is the friends of the Weltanschauung who will be disappointed I insist that the description that I have undertaken is quite different from theirs What for them is a lacuna an omission an error is for me a deliberate methodical exclusion But one might also say you have compared General Grammar with Natural History and the Analysis of Wealth But why not with History as it was practised at the time with Biblical criticism with rhetoric with the theory of the fine arts Wouldnt you then have discovered a quite different field of interpositivity What privilege then has the one that you have described  Privilege none it is only one of the describable groups if in fact one took General Grammar and tried to define its relations with the historical disciplines and textual criticism one would certainly see the emergence of a quite different system of relations and a description would reveal an interdiscursive network that was not identical with the first but which would overlap at certain points Similarly the taxonomy of the naturalists might be compared not with grammar and economics but with physiology and pathology there too new interpositivities would emerge one only has to compare the taxonomygrammareconomics relations analysed in The Order of Things with the taxonomypathology relations studied in Naissance de In 177 clinique The number of such networks is not therefore defined in advance only the test of analysis can show whether they exist and which of them exist that is which can be described Moreover every discursive formation does not belong necessarily at least to only one of these systems but enters simultaneously into several fields of relations in which it does not occupy the same place or exercise the same function the taxonomypathology relations are not isomorphic with the taxonomygrammar relations the grammarAnalysis of Wealth relations are not isomorphic with the grammarexegesis relations The horizon of archaeology therefore is not a science a rationality a mentality a culture it is a tangle of interpositivities whose limits and points of intersection cannot be fixed in a single operation Archaeology is a comparative analysis that is not intended to reduce the diversity of discourses and to outline the unity that must totalize them but is intended to divide up their diversity into different figures Archaeological comparison does not have a unifying but a diversifying effect  2 In confronting General Grammar Natural History and the Analysis of Wealth in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries one might wonder what ideas were shared at that time by linguists naturalists and economists one might wonder what implicit postulates they shared despite the diversity of their theories what general perhaps unstated principles they obeyed one might wonder what influence the analysis of language exercised on taxonomy or what role the idea of an ordered nature played in the theory of wealth one might also study the respective diffusion of these different types of discourse the prestige accorded to each the value attributed to it on account of its age or on the contrary on account of its newness or of its greater rigour the channels of communication by which information was exchanged lastly one might as in quite traditional analyses wonder to what extent Rousseau had transferred to the analysis of languages and their origin his knowledge and experience as a botanist what common categories Turgot applied to the analysis of coinage and to the theory of language and etymology how the idea of a universal artificial and perfect language had been taken up again and used by such classifiers as Linnaeus and Adanson Of course these questions would be legitimate  178 some of them at least But none of them would be relevant to the level of archaeology What archaeology wishes to uncover is primarily  in the specificity and distance maintained in various discursive formations  the play of analogies and differences as they appear at the level of rules of formation This implies five distinct tasks  aTo show how quite different discursive elements may be formed on the basis of similar rules the concepts of General Grammar like those of verb subject complement root are formed on the basis of the same arrangements of the enunciative field  theories of attribution articulation designation and derivation  as the very different radically heterogeneous concepts of Natural History and Economy to show between different formations the archaeological isomorphisms bTo show to what extent these rules do or do not apply in the same way are or are not linked in the same order are or are not arranged in accordance with the same model in different types of discourse General Grammar follows and in that same order the theory of attribution the theory of articulation the theory of designation and the theory of derivation Natural History and the Analysis of Wealth regroup the first two and the last two but they link each of them in the reverse order to define the archaeological model of each formation cTo show how entirely different concepts like those of value and specific character or price and generic character occupy a similar position in the ramification of their system of positivity  that they are therefore endowed with an archaeological isotopia  although their domain of application their degree of formalization and above all their historical genesis make them quite alien to one another dTo show on the other hand how a single notion possibly designated by a single word may cover two archaeologically distinct elements the notions of origin and evolution have neither the same role the same place nor the same formation in the system of positivity of General Grammar and Natural History to indicate the archaeological shifts 179 e Lastly to show how from one positivity to another relations of subordination or complementarity may he established thus in relation to the Analysis of Wealth and the analysis of species the description of language plays a dominant role in the Classical period in so far as it is the theory of institutional signs that duplicate mark and represent the representation itself to establish the archaeological correlations  None of these descriptions is based on the attribution of influences exchanges transmitted information or communications Not that I wish to deny their existence or deny that they could ever be the object of a description But rather that I have tried to step back from them to shift the level of attack of the analysis to reveal what made them possible to map the points at which the projection of one concept upon another could take place to fix the isomorphism that made a transference of methods or techniques possible to show the proximities sysmmetries or analogies that have made generalizations possible in short to describe the field of vectors and of differential receptivity of permeability and impermeability that has been a condition of historical possibility for the interplay of exchanges A configuration of interpositivity is not a group of neighbouring disciplines it is not only an observable phenomenon of resemblance it is not only the overall relation of several discourses to this or that other discourse it is the law of their communications Because Rousseau and others reflected in turn on the ordering of the species and the origin of the languages this does not mean that relations were made and exchanges occurred between taxonomy and grammar or because Turgot after Law and Petty wished to treat coinage as a sign that economy and the theory of language were brought close together and that their history still bears the trace of these attempts It means rather  if at least one is attempting to make an archaeological description  that the respective arrangements of these three positivities were such that at the level of uuvres authors individual existences projects and attempts one can find such exchanges  3 Archaeology also reveals relations between discursive formations and nondiscursive domains institutions political events economic 180 practices and processes These rapprochements are not intended to uncover great cultural continuities nor to isolate mechanisms of causality Before a set of enunciative facts archaeology does not ask what could have motivated them the search for contexts of formulation nor does it seek to rediscover what is expressed in them the task of hermeneutics it tries to determine how the rules of formation that govern it  and which characterize the positivity to which it belongs  may be linked to nondiscursive systems it seeks to define specific forms of articulation Let us take the example of clinical medicine whose establishment at the end of the eighteenth century is contemporary with a number of political events economic phenomena and institutional changes Between these facts and the organization of hospital medicine it is easy enough to suspect the existence of certain links at least if one operates largely on intuition But how can such links be analysed A symbolic analysis would see in the organizing of clinical medicine and in the historical processes that were concomitant with it two simultaneous expressions which reflect and symbolize one another which serve each other as a mirror and whose meanings are caught up in an endless play of reflexion two expressions that express nothing but the form that they share Thus medical ideas of organic solidarity functional cohesion tissular communication  and the abandonment of the classificatory principle of diseases in favour of an analysis of the bodily interactions  might correspond in order to reflect them but also to he reflected in them to a political practice that is discovering beneath still feudal stratifications relations of a functional type economic connexions a society whose dependences and reciprocities were to provide in the form of society the analogon of life A causal analysis on the other hand would try to discover to what extent political changes or ecomonic processes could determine the consciousness of scientists  the horizon and direction of their interest their system of values their way of perceiving things the style of their rationality thus at a period in which industrial capitalism was beginning to recalculate its manpower requirements disease took a on social dimension the maintenance of health cure public assistance for the poor and sick the search for pathological causes and sites became a collective responsibility that must be assumed by the state Hence the value placed upon 181 the body as a work tool the care to rationalize medicine on the basis of the other sciences the efforts to maintain the level of health of a population the attention paid to therapy aftercare and the recording of longterm phenomena Archaeology situates its analysis at another level the phenomena of expression reflexions and symbolization are for it merely the effects of an overall reading in search of formal analogies or translations of meaning as for causal relations they may be assigned to the level of the context or of the situation and their effect on the speaking subject both in any case can be mapped once one has defined the positivities in which they appear and the rules in accordance with which these positivities have been formed The field of relations that characterizes a discursive formation is the locus in which symbolizations and effects may he perceived situated and determined If archaeology brings medical discourse closer to a number of practices it is in order to discover far less immediate relations than expression but far more direct relations than those of a causality communicated through the consciousness of the speaking subjects It wishes to show not how political practice has determined the meaning and form of medical discourse but how and in what form it takes part in its conditions of emergence insertion and functioning This relation may he assigned to several levels First to that of the division and delimitation of the medical object not of course that it was political practice that from the early nineteenth century imposed on medicine such new objects as tissular lesions or the anatomophysiological correlations but it opened up new fields for the mapping of medical objects these fields are constituted by the mass of the population administratively compartmented and supervised gauged according to certain norms of life and health and analysed according to documentary and statistical forms of registration they are also constituted by the great conscript armies of the revolutionary and Napoleonic period with their specific form of medical control they are also constituted by the institutions of hospital assistance that were defined at the end of the eighteenth and the beginning of the nineteenth centuries in relation to the economic needs of the time and to the reciprocal position of the social classes One can also see the appearance of this relation of political practice to medical discourse in the status accorded to the doctor who becomes 182 not only the privileged but also virtually the exclusive enunciator of this discourse in the form of institutional relation that the doctor may have with the hospitalized patient or with his private practice in the modalities of teaching and diffusion that are prescribed or authorized for this knowledge Lastly one can grasp this relation in the function that is attributed to medical discourse or in the role that is required of it when it is a question of judging individuals making administrative decisions laying down the norms of a society translating  in order to resolve or to conceal them  conflicts of another order giving models of a natural type to analyses of society and to the practices that concern it It is not a question then of showing how the political practice of a given society constituted or modified the medical concepts and theoretical structure of pathology but how medical discourse as a practice concerned with a particular field of objects finding itself in the hands of a certain number of statutorily designated individuals and having certain functions to exercise in society is articulated on practices that are external to it and which are not themselves of a discursive order  If in this analysis archaeology suspends the theme of expression and reflexion if it refuses to see in discourse the surface of the symbolic projection of events or processes that are situated elsewhere it is not in order to rediscover a causal sequence that might be described point by point and which would make it possible to relate a discovery and an event or a concept and a social structure But on the other hand if it suspends such a causal analysis if it wishes to avoid the necessary connexion through the speaking subject it is not in order to guarantee the sovereign sole independence of discourse it is in order to discover the domain of existence and functioning of a discursive practice In other words the archaeological description of discourses is deployed in the dimension of a general history it seeks to discover that whole domain of institutions economic processes and social relations on which a discursive formation can be articulated it tries to show how the autonomy of discourse and its specificity nevertheless do not give it the status of pure ideality and total historical independence what it wishes to uncover is the particular level in which history can give place to definite types of discourse which have their own type of historicity and which are related to a whole set of various historicities 5 CHANGE And TRANSFORMATIONS Let us now turn to the archaeological description of change Whatever theoretical criticisms one can make of the traditional history of ideas it does at least take as its essential theme the phenomena of temporal succession and sequence analyses them in accordance with schemata of evolution and thus describes the historical deployment of discourses Archaeology however seems to treat history only to freeze it On the one hand by describing discursive formations it ignores the temporal relations that may he manifested in them it seeks general rules that will he uniformly valid in the same way and at every point in time does it not therefore impose the constricting figure of a synchrony on a development that may he slow and imperceptible In this world of ideas which is in itself so untrustworthy in which apparently the most stable figures disappear so quickly but in which so many irregularities occur that are later accorded definitive status in which the future always anticipates itself whereas the past is constantly shifting is not archaeology valid as a sort of motionless thought And on the other hand when it does have recourse to chronology it is only it seems in order to fix at the limits of the positivities two pinpoints the moment at which they are born and the moment at which they   184 disappear as if duration was used only to fix this crude calendar and was omitted throughout the analysis itself as if time existed only in the vacant moment of rupture in that white paradoxically atemporal crack in which one sudden formulation replaces another Whether as a synchrony of positivities or as an instantaneity of substitutions time is avoided and with it the possibility of a historical description disappears Discourse is snatched from the law of development and established in a discontinuous atemporality It is immobilized in fragments precarious splinters of eternity But there is nothing one can do about it several eternities succeeding one another a play of fixed images disappearing in turn do not constitute either movement time or history But the problem must be examined in greater detail Let us take first the apparent synchrony of discursive formations One thing is true it is no use establishing the rules in every statement and they cannot therefore he put into operation with every statement they do not change each time they can he found at work in statements or groups of statements in widely separated periods We have seen for example that for nearly a century  from Tournefort to Jussieu  the various objects of Natural History obeyed the same rules of formation we have seen that the theory of attribution is the same and plays the same role in the work of Lancelot Condillac and Destutt de Tracy Moreover we have seen that the order of statements based on archaeological derivation did not necessarily reproduce the order of successions one can find in Beauzee statements that are archeologically anterior to those to be found in the Grammaire of PortRoyal In such an analysis therefore there is a suspension of temporal successions  or to be more precise of the calendar of formulations But this suspension is intended precisely to reveal the relations that characterize the temporality of discursive formations and articulate them in series whose intersection in no way precludes analysis  a Archaeology defines the rules of formation of a group of state ments In this way it shows how a succession of events may in the same   185 order in which it is presented become an object of discourse be recorded described explained elaborated into concepts and provide the opportunity for a theoretical choice Archaeology analyses the degree and form of permeability of a discourse it provides the principle of its articulation over a chain of successive events it defines the operators by which the events are transcribed into statements It does not challenge for example the relation between the Analysis of Wealth and the great monetary fluctuations of the seventeenth and early eighteenth centuries it tries to show what in these crises could be given as an object of discourse how those crises could be conceptualized in such an object how the interests that were in conflict throughout these processes could deploy their strategy in them Or again it does not claim that the cholera epidemic of 1832 was not an event that concerned medicine it shows how clinical discourse put into operation such a body of rules that a whole domain of medical objects could then be reorganized that a whole group of methods of recording and notation could be used that the concept of inflammation could be abandoned and the old theoretical problem of fevers could be resolved definitively Archaeology does not deny the possibility of new statements in correlation with external events Its task is to show on what condition a correlation can exist between them and what precisely it consists of what are its limits its form its code its law of possibility It does not try to avoid that mobility of discourses that makes them move to the rhythm of events it tries to free the level at which it is set in motion  what might he called the level of evential engagement An engagement that is specific for every discursive formation and which does not have the same rules the same operators or the same sensibility in for example the Analysis of Wealth and in Political Economy in the old medicine of the constitutions and in modern epidemiology  h Moreover all the rules of formation assigned by archaeology to a positivity do not have the same generality some are more specific and derive from others This subordination may be merely hierarchical but it may also involve a temporal vector Thus in General Grammar the theory of the verbattribution and that of the nounarticulation are linked to one another and the second derives from the first but   186 without it being possible to determine an order of succession between them other than the deductive or rhetorical order that has been chosen for the expose On the other hand the analysis of the complement or the search for roots could appear or reappear only when the analysis of the attributive sentence or the notion of the noun as an analytic sign of representation had been developed Another example in the Classical period the principle of the continuity of beings is implied in the classification of species according to structural characters and in this sense they are simultaneous on the other hand it is only when this classification is undertaken that the lacunae and gaps may be interpreted in the categories of a history of nature of the earth and of the species In other words the archaeological ramification of the rules of formation is not a uniformly simultaneous network there exist relations branches derivations that are temporally neutral there exist others that imply a particular temporal direction Archaeology then takes as its model neither a purely logical schema of simultaneities nor a linear succession of events but it tries to show the intersection between necessarily successive relations and others that are not so It does not believe therefore that a system of positivity is a synchronic figure that one can perceive only by suspending the whole of the diachronic process Far from being indifferent to succession archaeology maps the temporal vectors of derivation  Archaeology does not set out to treat as simultaneous what is given as successive it does not try to freeze time and to substitute for its flux of events correlations that outline a motionless figure What it suspends is the theme that succession is an absolute a primary indissociable sequence to which discourse is subjected by the law of its finitude it is also the theme that there is in discourse only one form and only one level of succession For these themes it substitutes analyses that reveal both the various forms of succession that are superposed in discourse and by forms I do not simply mean the rhythms or causes but the series themselves and the way in which the successions thus specified are articulated Instead of following the thread of an original calendar in relation to which one would establish the chronology of successive or simultaneous events that of short or lasting processes that of momentary or permanent phenomena one tries to show how it is 187 possible for there to be succession and at what different levels distinct successions are to be found To constitute an archaeological history of discourse then one must free oneself of two models that have for so long imposed their image the linear model of speech and partly at least of writing in which all events succeed one another without any effect of coincidence and superposition and the model of the stream of consciousness whose presence always eludes itself in its openness to the future and its retention of the past Paradoxical as it may be discursive formations do not have the same model of historicity as the flow of consciousness or the linearity of language Discourse at least as analysed by archaeology that is at the level of its positivity is not a consciousness that embodies its project in the external form of language langage it is not a language longue plus a subject to speak it It is a practice that has its own forms of sequence and succession Archaeology is much more willing than the history of ideas to speak of discontinuities ruptures gaps entirely new forms of positivity and of sudden redistributions The practice of political economy was traditionally to seek everything that led up to Ricardo everything that could foreshadow his analyses methods and principal notions everything that tended to make his discoveries more probable the practice of the history of comparative grammar was to rediscover  beyond Bopp and Rask  earlier research into the filiation and kinship of languages it was to determine how much AnquetilDuperron contributed towards the constitution of an IndoEuropean domain it was to uncover the first comparison made in 1769 of Sanskrit and Latin conjugations it may even lead one back to Harris or Ramus Archaeology proceeds in the opposite direction it seeks rather to untie all those knots that historians have patiently tied it increases differences blurs the lines of communication and tries to make it more difficult to pass from one thing to another it does not try to show that the Physiocratic analysis of production foreshadowed that of Ricardo it does not regard it as relevant to its own analyses to say that Cceurdoux foreshadowed Bopp What does this insistence on discontinuities correspond to In fact it   188 is paradoxical only in relation to the practice of the historians of ideas It is rather the history of ideas  with its concern for continuities transitions anticipations and foreshadowings  that plays with paradox From Daubenton to Cuvier from Anquetil to Bopp from Graslin Turgot or Forbonnais to Ricardo  even such a chronologically small gap  the differences are innumerable some are localized others are more general some concern methods others concepts sometimes they concern the domain of objects at others the whole linguistic instrument More striking still is the example of medicine in a quarter of a century from 1790 to 1815 medical discourse changed more profoundly than since the seventeenth century probably than since the Middle Ages and perhaps even since Greek medicine a change that revealed new objects organic lesions deep sites tissular alterations ways and forms of interorganic diffusion anatomoclinical signs and correlations techniques of observation of detection of the pathological site recording a new perceptual grid and on almost entirely new descriptive vocabulary new sets of concepts and nosographical distributions centuryold sometimes ageold categories such as fever or constitution disappeared and diseases that are perhaps as old as the world  like tuberculosis  were at last isolated and named Those who say that archaeology invents differences in an arbitrary way can never have opened La Nosographic philosophique and the Traite des membranes Archaeology is simply trying to take such differences seriously to throw some light on the matter to determine how they are divided up how they are entangled with one another how they govern or are governed by one another to which distinct categories they belong in short to describe these differences not to establish a system of differences between them If there is a paradox in archaeology it is not that it increases differences but that it refuses to reduce them  thus inverting the usual values For the history of ideas the appearance of difference indicates an error or a trap instead of examining it the clever historian must try to reduce it to find beneath it a smaller difference and beneath that an even smaller one and so on until he reaches the ideal limit the nondifference of perfect continuity Archaeology on the other hand takes as the object of its description what is usually regarded as an obstacle its aim is not to overcome differences but to analyse them to say what   189 exactly they consist of to differentiate them How does this differentiation operate  1 Instead of considering that discourse is made up of a series of homogeneous events individual formulations archaeology distinguishes several possible levels of events within the very density of discourse the level of the statements themselves in their unique emergence the level of the appearance of objects types of enunciation concepts strategic choices or transformations that affect those that already exist the level of the derivation of new rules of formation on the basis of rules that are already in operation  but always in the element of a single positivity lastly a fourth level at which the substitution of one discursive formation for another takes place or the mere appearance and disappearance of a positivity These events which are by far the most rare are for archaeology the most important only archaeology in any case can reveal them But they are not the exclusive object of its description it would be a mistake to think that they have an absolute control over all the others and that they lead to similar simultaneous ruptures at the different levels distinguished above All the events that occur within the density of discourse are not immediately below one another Of course the appearance of a discursive formation is often correlative with a vast renewal of objects forms of enunciation concepts and strategies a principle that is not universal however General Grammar was established in the seventeenth century without much apparent alteration in grammatical tradition but it is not possible to determine the particular concept or object that suddenly manifests its presence One should not describe such an event therefore in accordance with categories that may be suitable for the emergence of a formulation or the appearance of a new word It is useless to ask of such an event questions like Who is its author Who is speaking In what circumstances and in what context With what intentions what project in mind The appearance of a new positivity is not indicated by a new sentence  unexpected surprising logically unpredictable stylistically deviant  that is inserted into a text and announces either the opening of a new chapter or the entry of a new speaker It is an event of a quite different type i   190 2 In order to analyse such events it is not enough simply to indicate changes and to relate them immediately to the theological aesthetic model of creation with its transcendence with all its originalities and inventions or to the psychological model of the act of consciousness with its previous obscurity its anticipations its favourable circumstances its powers of restoration or to the biological model of evolution We must define precisely what these changes consist of that is substitute for an undifferentiated reference to change  which is both a general container for all events and the abstract principle of their succession  the analysis of transformations The disappearance of one positivity and the emergence of another implies several types of transformation By going from the more particular to the more general one can and must describe how the different elements of a system of formation were transformed what for example were the variations in the rate of unemployment and labour needs what were the political decisions concerning the guilds and the universities what were the new needs and new possibilities of public assistance at the end of the eighteenth century  all these were elements in the system of formation of clinical medicine how the characteristic relations of a system of formation were transformed how in the middle of the seventeenth century for example the relation between the perceptual field the linguistic code the use of instruments and information that was put into operation by the discourse on living beings was modified thus making possible the definition of the objects proper to Natural History how the relations between different rules of formation were transformed how for example biology modified the order and the dependence that Natural History had established between the theory of characterization and the analysis of temporal derivations lastly how the relations between various positivities were transformed how the relations between philology biology and economics transform the relations between General Grammar Natural History and the Analysis of Wealth how the interdiscursive configuration outlined by the privileged relations of these three disciplines is decomposed how their respective relations with mathematics and philosophy are modified how a place emerges for other discursive formations and in particular for that interpositivity that was later to assume the name of the human sciences Rather than refer to the living force of change as if it were   191 its own principle rather than seek its causes as if it were no more than a mere effect archaeology tries to establish the system of transformations that constitute change it tries to develop this empty abstract notion with a view to according it the analysable status of transformation It is understandable that some minds are so attached to all those old metaphors by which for a century and a half history movement flux evolution has been imagined that they see archaeology simply as the negation of history and the crude affirmation of discontinuity the truth is that they cannot accept that change should be cleansed of all these adventitious models that it should be deprived of both its primacy as a universal law and its status as a general effect and that it should be replaced by the analysis of various transformations  3 To say that one discursive formation is substituted for another is not to say that a whole world of absolutely new objects enunciations concepts and theoretical choices emerges fully armed and fully organized in a text that will place that world once and for all it is to say that a general transformation of relations has occurred but that it does not necessarily alter all the elements it is to say that statements are governed by new rules of formation it is not to say that all objects or concepts all enunciations or all theoretical choices disappear On the contrary one can on the basis of these new rules describe and analyse phenomena of continuity return and repetition we must not forget that a rule of formation is neither the determination of an object nor the characterization of a type of enunciation nor the form or content of a concept but the principle of their multiplicity and dispersion One of these elements  or several of them  may remain identical preserve the same division the same characteristics the same structures yet belong to different systems of dispersion and be governed by distinct laws of formation One can find in such phenomena therefore elements that remain throughout several distinct positivities their form and content remaining the same but their formations being heterogeneous such as monetary circulation as an object first in the Analysis of Wealth and then in political economy the concept of character first in Natural History then in biology elements that are constituted modified organized in one discursive formation and which stabilized at last figure in another such as the concept of reflex which as   192 G Canguilhem has shown was formed in Classical science from Willis to Prochaska then entered modern physiology elements that appear later as an ultimate derivation in a discursive formation and which occupy an important place in a later formation such as the notion of organism which appeared at the end of the eighteenth century in Natural History and as the result of a whole taxonomic enterprise of characterization and which became the major concept of biology at the time of Cuvier or the notion of lesional site which Morgagni discovered and which became one of the principal concepts of clinical medicine elements that reappear after a period of desuetude oblivion or even invalidation such as the return to a Linnaean type of fixism in a biologist like Cuvier or the reactivation in the eighteenth century of the old notion of an original language The problem for archaeology is not to deny such phenomena nor to try to diminish their importance but on the contrary to try to describe and measure them how can such permanences or repetitions such long sequences or such curves projected through time exist Archaeology does not hold the content for the primary and ultimate dormee that must account for all the rest on the contrary it considers that the same the repetitive and the uninterrupted are no less problematic than the ruptures for archaeology the identical and the continuous are not what must be found at the end of the analysis they figure in the element of a discursive practice they too are governed by the rules of formation of positivities far from manifesting that fundamental reassuring inertia which we like to use as a criterion of change they are themselves actively regularly formed And to those who might be tempted to criticize archaeology for concerning itself primarily with the analysis of the discontinuous to all those agoraphobics of history and time to all those who confuse rupture and irrationality I will reply It is you who devalue the continuous by the use that you make of it You treat it as the supportelement to which everything else must be related you treat it as the primary law the essential weight of any discursive practice you would like to analyse every modification in the field of this inertia as one analyses every movement in the gravitational field But in according this status to continuity you are merely neutralizing it driving it out to the outer limit of time towards an original passivity Archaeology proposes to invert this arrangement or rather for our    193 aim is not to accord to the discontinuous the role formerly accorded to the continuous to play one off against the other to show how the continuous is formed in accordance with the same conditions and the same rules as dispersion and how it enters  neither more nor less than differences inventions innovations or deviations  the field of discursive practice  4 The appearance and disappearance of positivities the play of substitutions to which they give rise do not constitute a homogeneous process that takes place everywhere in the same way We must not imagine that rupture is a sort of great drift that carries with it all discursive formations at once rupture is not an undifferentiated interval  even a momentary one  between two manifest phases it is not a kind of lapsus without duration that separates two periods and which deploys two heterogeneous stages on either side of a split it is always a discontinuity specified by a number of distinct transformations between two particular positivities The analysis of archaeological breaks sets out therefore to establish between so many different changes analogies and differences hierarchies complementarities coincidences and shifts in short to describe the dispersion of the discontinuities themselves The idea of a single break suddenly at a given moment dividing all discursive formations interrupting them in a single moment and reconstituting them in accordance with the same rules  such an idea cannot be sustained The contemporaneity of several transformations does not mean their exact chronological coincidence each transformation may have its own particular index of temporal viscosity Natural History General Grammar and the Analysis of Wealth were constituted in similar ways and all three in the course of the seventeenth century but the system of formation of the Analysis of Wealth was linked with a great many conditions and nondiscursive practices the circulation of goods monetary manipulations and their effects the system of protecting trade and manufactures fluctuations in the quantity of metal coined hence the slowness of a process that lasted for over a century from Grammont to Cantillon whereas the transformations that had taken place in General Grammar and Natural History had extended over scarcely more than twentyfive years Inversely contemporary 194 similar and linked transformations do not belong to a single model that is reproduced several times on the surface of discourses and imposes on all a strictly identical form of rupture when one describes the archaeological break that led to philology biology and economics one is showing how these three positivities were linked by the disappearance of the analysis of the sign and of the theory of representation what symmetrical effects it could produce the idea of a totality and of an organic adaptation among living beings the idea of morphological coherence and of a regulated evolution in languages the idea of a form of production that has its internal laws and its limits of development but it also shows what were the specific differences of these transformations how in particular historicity is introduced in a particular way in these three positivities how their relation to history cannot therefore be the same even though they all have a particular relation with it Lastly there are important shifts between different archaeological ruptures  and sometimes even between discursive formations that are very close and linked by a great many relations Let us take the disciplines of languages and historical analysis the great transformation that gave rise at the beginning of the nineteenth century to a historical comparative grammar preceded by a good halfcentury the mutation in historical discourse as a result the system of interpositivity in which philology was involved was profoundly affected in the second half of the nineteenth century without the positivity of philology ever being put into question Hence phenomena of fragmented shift of which we can cite at least another famous example concepts like those of surplus value or falling rate of profit as found in Marx may be described on the basis of the system of positivity that is already in operation in the work of Ricardo but these concepts which are new but whose rules of formation are not appear  in Marx himself  as belonging at the same time to a quite different discursive practice they are formed in that discursive practice in accordance with specific laws they occupy in it a different position they do not figure in the same sequences this new positivity is not a transformation of Ricardos analyses it is not a new political economy it is a discourse that occurred around the derivation of certain economic concepts but which in turn defines the conditions in which the discourse of 195 economists takes place and may therefore be valid as a theory and a critique of political economy Archaeology disarticulates the synchrony of breaks just as it destroyed the abstract unity of change and event The period is neither its basic unity nor its horizon nor its object if it speaks of these things it is always in terms of particular discursive practices and as a result of its analyses The Classical age which has often been mentioned in archaeological analyses is not a temporal figure that imposes its unity and empty form on all discourses it is the name that is given to a tangle of continuities and discontinuities modifications within positivities discursive formations that appear and disappear Similarly rupture is not for archaeology the prop of its analyses the limit that it indicates from afar without being able either to determine it or to give it specificity rupture is the name given to transformations that bear on the general rules of one or several discursive formations Thus the French Revolution  since up to now all archaeological analyses have been centred on it  does not play the role of an event exterior to discourse whose divisive effect one is under some kind of obligation to discover in all discourses it functions as a complex articulated describable group of transformations that left a number of positivities intact fixed for a number of others rules that are still with us and also established positivities that have recently disappeared or are still disappearing before our eyes  196 6 SCIENCE AND KNOWLEDGE A silent delimitation has been imposed on all the preceding analyses without the principle governing it or even its outline being made clear All the examples referred to belonged without exception to a very small domain In no way could I be said to have covered let alone analysed the immense domain of discourse why did I systematically ignore literary philosophical or political texts Do not discursive formations and systems of positivities have a place in them too And if I was restricting my attention to the sciences why did I say nothing of mathematics physics or chemistry Why did I concentrate on so many dubious still imprecise disciplines that are perhaps doomed for ever to remain below the threshold of scientificity In short what is the relation between archaeology and the analysis of the sciences a POSITIVITIES DISCIPLINES SCIENCES First question does not archaeology under the rather bizarre terms of discursive formation and positivity describe what are quite simply pseudosciences like psychopathology sciences at the prehistoric stage like Natural History or sciences entirely penetrated with ideology like political economy Is it not the privileged analysis of what will always remain quasiscientific If one calls disciplines groups of   197 statements that borrow their organization from scientific models which tend to coherence and demonstrativity which are accepted institutionalized transmitted and sometimes taught as sciences could one not say that archaeology describes disciplines that are not really sciences while epistemology describes sciences that have been formed on the basis of or in spite of existing disciplines To these questions I can reply in the negative Archaeology does not describe disciplines At most such disciplines may in their manifest deployment serve as startingpoints for the description of positivities but they do not fix its limits they do not impose definitive divisions upon it at the end of the analysis they do not reemerge in the same state in which they entered it one cannot establish a biunivocal relation between established disciplines and discursive formations Let us take an example of this distortion The linchpin of Madness and Civilization was the appearance at the beginning of the nineteenth century of a psychiatric discipline This discipline had neither the same content nor the same internal organization nor the same place in medicine nor the same practical function nor the same methods as the traditional chapter on diseases of the head or nervous diseases to be found in eighteenthcentury medical treatises But on examining this new discipline we discovered two things what made it possible at the time it appeared what brought about this great change in the economy of concepts analyses and demonstrations was a whole set of relations between hospitalization internment the conditions and procedures of social exclusion the rules of jurisprudence the norms of industrial labour and bourgeois morality in short a whole group of relations that characterized for this discursive practice the formation of its statements but this practice is not only manifested in a discipline possessing a scientific status and scientific pretensions it is also found in operation in legal texts in literature in philosophy in political decisions and in the statements made and the opinions expressed in daily life The discursive formation whose existence was mapped by the psychiatric discipline was not coextensive with it far from it it went well beyond the boundaries of psychiatry Moreover by going back in time and trying to discover what in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries could have preceded the establishment of psychiatry we realized that there was no such prior discipline what had been said   198 on the subject of mania delirium melancholia and nervous diseases by the doctors of the Classical period in no way constituted an autonomous discipline but at most a commentary on the analysis of fevers of alterations in the humours or of affections of the brain However despite the absence of any established discipline a discursive practice with its own regularity and consistency was in operation This discursive practice was certainly present in medicine but it was also to be found in administrative regulations in literary or philosophical texts in casuistics in the theories or projects of obligatory labour or assistance to the poor In the Classical period therefore there were a discursive formation and a positivity perfectly accessible to description to which corresponded no definite discipline that could be compared with psychiatry But although it is true that positivities are not merely the doublets of established disciplines are they not the prototypes of future sciences By discursive formation does one not mean the retrospective projection of sciences on their own past the shadow that they cast on what preceded them and which thus appears to have foreshadowed them What we have described for example as the Analysis of Wealth or General Grammar thus according them what was perhaps a highly artificial autonomy was it not quite simply political economy in an inchoate state or a stage prior to the establishment of a truly rigorous science of language Is it archaeology trying by means of a retrograde movement whose legitimacy it would no doubt be difficult to establish to regroup in an independent discursive practice all the heterogeneous and dispersed elements whose complicity will prove to he necessary to the establishment of a science Again the answer must be in the negative What was analysed under the name of Natural History does not embrace in a single figure everything that in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries might validly constitute a prototype of the science of life and figure in its legitimate genealogy The positivity thus revealed accounts for a number of statements concerning the resemblances and differences between beings their visible structure their specific and generic characters their possible classification the discontinuities that separate them and the transitions that connect them but it ignores a number of other analyses that date nevertheless from the same period and which   199 also outline the ancestral figures of biology the analysis of reflex movement which was to have so much importance in the constitution of an anatomophysiology of the nervous system the theory of germs which seems to anticipate the problems of evolution and genetics the explanation of animal or vegetal growth which was to be one of the major questions of the physiology of organisms in general Moreover far from anticipating a future biology Natural History  a taxonomic discourse linked to the theory of signs and to the project of a science of order  excluded by its solidity and autonomy the constitution of a unitary science of life Similarly the discursive formation described as General Grammar does not take into account  far from it  everything that could have been said about language in the Classical period and of which the inheritance or repudiation development or critique was to be found later in philology it ignored the methods of Biblical exegesis and that philosophy of language as formulated by Vico or Herder Discursive formations are not therefore future sciences at the stage at which still unconscious of themselves they are quietly being constituted they are not in fact in a state of teleological subordination in relation to the orthogenesis of the sciences Should it be said therefore that there can he no science where there is a positivity and that positivities are always exclusive of the sciences Should it be supposed that instead of being in a chronological relation to the sciences they are in fact alternatives That they are in a way the positive figure of a certain epistemological defect But here too one could find a counterexample Clinical medicine is certainly not a science Not only because it does not comply with the formal criteria or attain the level of rigour expected of physics chemistry or even of physiology but also because it involves a scarcely organized mass of empirical observations uncontrolled experiments and results therapeutic prescriptions and institutional regulations And yet this nonscience is not exclusive of science in the course of the nineteenth century it established definite relations between such perfectly constituted sciences as physiology chemistry or microbiology moreover it gave rise to such discourses as that of morbid anatomy which it would be presumptuous no doubt to call a false science Discursive formations can be identified therefore neither as sciences nor as scarcely scientific disciplines nor as distant prefigurations   200 of the sciences to come nor as forms that exclude any scientificity from the outset What therefore is the relation between the positivities and the sciences b KNOWLEDGE SAVOIR Positivities do not characterize forms of knowledge  whether they are a priori necessary conditions or forms of rationality that have in turn been put into operation by history But neither do they define the state of knowledge at a given moment in time they do not draw up a list of what from that moment had been demonstrated to be true and had assumed the status of definitively acquired knowledge and a list of what on the other hand had been accepted without either proof or adequate demonstration or of what had been accepted as a common belief or a belief demanded by the power of the imagination To analyse positivities is to show in accordance with which rules a discursive practice may form groups of objects enunciations concepts or theoretical choices The elements thus formed do not constitute a science with a defined structure of ideality their system of relations is certainly less strict but neither are they items of knowledge piled up one on top of another derived from heterogeneous experiments traditions or discoveries and linked only by the identity of the subject that possesses them They are that on the basis of which coherent or incoherent propositions are built up more or less exact descriptions developed verifications carried out theories deployed They form the precondition of what is later revealed and which later functions as an item of knowledge or an illusion an accepted truth or an exposed error a definitive acquisition or an obstacle surmounted This precondition may not of course be analysed as a donee a lived experience still implicated in the imagination or in perception which manking in the course of its history took up again in the form of rationality or which each individual must undergo on his own account if he wishes to rediscover the ideal meanings that are contained or concealed within it It is not a preknowledge or an archaic stage in the movement that leads from immediate knowledge to apodicticity it is a group of elements that would have to be formed by a discursive practice if a scientific discourse was to be constituted specified not only by its form and 201 rigour but also by the objects with which it deals the types of enunciation that it uses the concepts that it manipulates and the strategies that it employs Thus science is not linked with that which must have been lived or must be lived if the intention of ideality proper to it is to he established but with that which must have been said  or must be said  if a discourse is to exist that complies if necessary with the experimental or formal criteria of scientificity This group of elements formed in a regular manner by a discursive practice and which are indispensable to the constitution of a science although they are not necessarily destined to give rise to one can he called knowledge Knowledge is that of which one can speak in a discursive practice and which is specified by that fact the domain constituted by the different objects that will or will not acquire a scientific status the knowledge of psychiatry in the nineteenth century is not the sum of what was thought to he true but the whole set of practices singularities and deviations of which one could speak in psychiatric discourse knowledge is also the space in which the subject may take up a position and speak of the objects with which he deals in his discourse in this sense the knowledge of clinical medicine is the whole group of functions of observation interrogation decipherment recording and decision that may be exercised by the subject of medical discourse knowledge is also the field of coordination and subordination of statements in which concepts appear and are defined applied and transformed at this level the knowledge of Natural History in the eighteenth century is not the sum of what was said but the whole set of modes and sites in accordance with which one can integrate each new statement with the already said lastly knowledge is defined by the possibilities of use and appropriation offered by discourse thus the knowledge of political economy in the Classical period is not the thesis of the different theses sustained but the totality of its points of articulation on other discourses or on other practices that are not discursive There are bodies of knowledge that are independent of the sciences which are neither their historical prototypes nor their practical byproducts but there is no knowledge without a particular discursive practice and any discursive practice may he defined by the knowledge that it forms Instead of exploring the consciousnessknowledge connaissance  202 science axis which cannot escape subjectivity archaeology explores the discursive practiceknowledge savoirscience axis And whereas the history of ideas finds the point of balance of its analysis in the element of connaissance and is thus forced against its will to encounter the transcendental interrogation archaeology finds the point of balance of its analysis in savoir  that is in a domain in which the subject is necessarily situated and dependent and can never figure as titular either as a transcendental activity or as empirical consciousness It is understandable in these conditions that we should distinguish carefully between scientific domains and archaeological territories their articulation and their principles of organization are quite different Only propositions that obey certain laws of construction belong to a domain of scientificity affirmations that have the same meaning that say the same thing that are as true as they are but which do not belong to the same systematicity are excluded from this domain what Diderots Le Reve de dAlembert says about the development of species may well express certain of the concepts or certain of the scientific hypotheses of the period it may even anticipate a future truth it does not belong to the domain of scientificity of Natural History but it does not belong to its archaeological territory if at least one can discover in operation in it the same rules of formation as in Linnaeus Buffon Daubenton or Jussieu Archaeological territories may extend to literary or philosophical texts as well as scientific ones Knowledge is to be found not only in demonstrations it can also he found in fiction reflexion narrative accounts institutional regulations and political decisions The archaeological territory of Natural History includes Bonnets Palingenesie philosophique or Benoit de Maillets Telliamed although they do not comply to a great extent with the accepted scientific norms of the period and even less of course with those that came to be required later The archaeological territory of General Grammar embraces the imaginings of Fabre dOlivet which were never accorded scientific status and belong rather to the sphere of mystical thought no less than the analysis of attributive propositions which was then accepted as evident truth and in which generative grammar may now recognize its prefigured truth  footnote    For the distinction between connaissance and savoir cf note 3 p 16 203 Discursive practice does not coincide with the scientific development that it may give rise to and the knowledge that it forms is neither an unfinished prototype nor the byproduct to be found in daily life of a constituted science The sciences  ignoring for the moment the difference between discourses that have the status of scientificity or pretensions to it and those that really present the formal criteria of a science  appear in the element of a discursive formation and against the background of knowledge This opens up two series of problems what can be the place or role of a region of scientificity in the archaeological territory in which it appears In accordance with what order and what processes is the emergence of a region of scientificity in a given discursive formation accompished We cannot at present provide solutions to these problems all we can do now is to indicate in what direction they might be analysed c KNOWLEDGE SAVOIR AND IDEOLOGY Once constituted a science does not take up with all the interconnexions that are proper to it everything that formed the discursive practice in which it appeared nor does it dissipate  in order to condemn it to the prehistory of error prejudice or imagination  the knowledge that surrounds it Morbid anatomy did not reduce to the norms of scientificity the positivity of clinical medicine Knowledge is not an epistemological site that disappears in the science that supersedes it Science or what is offered as such is localized in a field of knowledge and plays a role in it A role that varies according to different discursive formations and is modified with their mutations What in the Classical period was offered as the medical knowledge of diseases of the mind occupied a very small place in the knowledge of madness it constituted scarcely more than one of its many surfaces of contact the others being jurisprudence casuistics police regulations etc on the other hand the psychopathological analyses of the nineteenth century which were also offered as scientific knowledge connaissance of mental diseases played a very different much more important role in the knowledge savoir of madness the role of model and decisionmaking authority Similarly scientific discourse or scientific pretension does not perform the same function in the   204 economic knowledge of the seventeenth and in that of the nineteenth century In any discursive formation one finds a specific relation between science and knowledge and instead of defining between them a relation of exclusion or subtraction by trying to discover what in knowledge still eludes and resists science what in science is still compromised by its proximity to and the influence of knowledge archaeological analysis must show positively how a science functions in the element of knowledge It is probably there in that space of interplay that the relations of ideology to the sciences are established The hold of ideology over scientific discourse and the ideological functioning of the sciences are not articulated at the level of their ideal structure even if they can be expressed in it in a more or less visible way nor at the level of their technical use in a society although that society may obtain results from it nor at the level of the consciousness of the subjects that built it up they are articulated where science is articulated upon knowledge If the question of ideology may be asked of science it is in so far as science without being identified with knowledge but without either effacing or excluding it is localized in it structures certain of its objects systematizes certain of its enunciations formalizes certain of its concepts and strategies it is in so far as this development articulates knowledge modifies it and redistributes it on the one hand and confirms it and gives it validity on the other it is in so far as science finds its place in a discursive regularity in which by that very fact it is or is not deployed functions or does not function in a whole field of discursive practices In short the question of ideology that is asked of science is not the question of situations or practices that it reflects more or less consciously nor is it the question of the possible use or misuse to which it could be put it is the question of its existence as a discursive practice and of its functioning among other practices Broadly speaking and setting aside all mediation and specificity it can be said that political economy has a role in capitalist society that it serves the interests of the bourgeois class that it was made by and for that class and that it hears the mark of its origins even in its concepts and logical architecture but any more precise description of the relations between the epistemological structure of political economy and its ideological function must take into account the analysis of the   205 discursive formation that gave rise to it and the group of objects concepts and theoretical choices that it had to develop and systematize and one must then show how the discursive practice that gave rise to such a positivity functioned among other practices that might have been of a discursive but also of a political or economic order This enables us to advance a number of propositions  I Ideology is not exclusive of scientificity Few discourses have given so much place to ideology as clinical discourse or that of political economy this is not a sufficiently good reason to treat the totality of their statements as being undermined by error contradiction and a lack of objectivity 2Theoretical contradictions lacunae defects may indicate the ideological functioning of a science or of a discourse with scientific pretensions they may enable us to determine at what point in the structure this functioning takes effect But the analysis of this functioning must be made at the level of the positivity and of the relations between the rules of formation and the structures of scientificity 3By correcting itself by rectifying its errors by clarifying its formulations discourse does not necessarily undo its relations with ideology The role of ideology does not diminish as rigour increases and error is dissipated 4To tackle the ideological functioning of a science in order to reveal and to modify it is not to uncover the philosophical presuppositions that may lie within it nor is it to return to the foundations that made it possible and that legitimated it it is to question it as a discursive formation it is to tackle not the formal contradictions of its propositions but the system of formation of its objects its types of enunciation its concepts its theoretical choices It is to treat it as one practice among others d DIFFERENT THRESHOLDS AND THEIR CHRONOLOGY It is possible to describe several distinct emergences of a discursive formation The moment at which a discursive practice achieves individuality and autonomy the moment therefore at which a single   206 system for the formation of statements is put into operation or the moment at which this system is transformed might be called the threshold of positivity When in the operation of a discursive formation a group of statements is articulated claims to validate even unsuccessfully norms of verification and coherence and when it exercises a dominant function as a model a critique or a verification over knowledge we will say that the discursive formation crosses a threshold of epistemologization When the epistemological figure thus outlined obeys a number of formal criteria when its statements comply not only with archaeological rules of formation but also with certain laws for the construction of propositions we will say that it has crossed a threshold of scientificity And when this scientific discourse is able in turn to define the axioms necessary to it the elements that it uses the propositional structures that are legitimate to it and the transformations that it accepts when it is thus able taking itself as a startingpoint to deploy the formal edifice that it constitutes we will say that it has crossed the threshold of formalization The distribution in time of these different thresholds their succession their possible coincidence or lack of it the way in which they may govern one another or become implicated with one another the conditions in which in turn they are established constitute for archaeology one of its major domains of exploration Their chronology in fact is neither regular nor homogeneous The discursive formations do not cross them at regular intervals or at the same time thus dividing up the history of human knowledge connaissances into different ages at a time when many positivities have crossed the threshold of formalization many others have not yet attained that of scientificity or even of epistemologization Moreover each discursive formation does not pass through these different thresholds in turn as through the natural stages of biological maturation in which the only variable is the latency period or the length of the intervals They are in fact events whose dispersion is not evolutive their unique order is one of the characteristics of each discursive formation Here are a few examples of these differences In some cases the threshold of positivity is crossed well before that of epistemologization thus psychopathology as a discourse with scientific pretensions epistemologized at the beginning of the nineteenth   207 century with Pinel Heinroth and Esquirol a discursive practice that largely antedated it and that had acquired its autonomy and system of regularity long before But there are also cases in which these two stages are confused in time when the establishment of a positivity involves at the same time the emergence of an epistemological figure Sometimes the thresholds of scientificity are linked with the transition from one positivity to another sometimes they are different thus the transition from Natural History with the scientificity that was proper to it to biology as a science not of the classification of beings but of specific correlations of different organisms did not take place at the time of Cuvier without the transformation of one positivity into another on the other hand the experimental medicine of Claude Bernard then the microbiology of Pasteur modified the type of scientificity required by morbid anatomy and physiology without the discursive formation of clinical medicine as then established being made inoperable Similarly the new scientificity established in the biological disciplines by evolutionism did not modify the biological positivity that had been defined at the time of Cuvier In the case of economics the disconnexions are particularly numerous In the seventeenth century one can recognize a threshold of positivity it almost coincides with the practice and theory of mercantilism but its epistemologization did not occur until later at the very end of the century or the beginning of the next century with Locke and Cantillon However the nineteenth century with Ricardo marks both a new type of positivity a new form of epistemologization which were later to he modified in turn by Cournot and Jevons at the very time that Marx was to reveal an entirely new discursive practice on the basis of political economy If one recognizes in science only the linear accumulation of truths or the orthogenesis of reason and fails to recognize in it a discursive practice that has its own levels its own thresholds its own various ruptures one can describe only a single historical division which one adopts as a model to be applied at all times and for all forms of knowledge a division between what is definitively or what is not yet scientific All the density of the disconnexions the dispersion of the ruptures the shifts in their effects the play of the interdependence are reduced to the monotonous act of an endlessly repeated foundation   208 There is perhaps only one science for which one can neither distinguish these different thresholds nor describe a similar set of shifts mathematics the only discursive practice to have crossed at one and the same time the thresholds of positivity epistemologization scientificity and formalization The very possibility of its existence implied that which in all other sciences remains dispersed throughout history should be given at the outset its original positivity was to constitute an already formalized discursive practice even if other formalizations were to be used later Hence the fact that their establishment is both so enigmatic so little accessible to analysis so confined within the form of the absolute beginning and so valid since it is valid both as an origin and as a foundation hence the fact that in the first gesture of the first mathematician one saw the constitution of an ideality that has been deployed throughout history and has been questioned only to be repeated and purified hence the fact that the beginning of mathematics is questioned not so much as a historical event as for its validity as a principal of history and hence the fact that for all the other sciences the description of its historical genesis its gropings and failures its late emergence is related to the metahistorical model of a geometry emerging suddenly once and for all from the trivial practices of landmeasuring But if one takes the establishment of mathematical discourse as a prototype for the birth and development of all the other sciences one runs the risk of homogenizing all the unique forms of historicity of reducing to the authority of a single rupture all the different thresholds that a discursive practice may cross and reproduce endlessly at every moment in time the problem of origin the rights of the historicotranscendental analysis would thus be reinstated Mathematics has certainly served as a model for most scientific discourses in their efforts to attain formal rigour and demonstrativity but for the historian who questions the actual development of the sciences it is a bad example an example at least from which one cannot generalize e THE DIFFERENT TYPES OF THE HISTORY OF THE SCIENCES The multiple thresholds that we have succeeded in mapping make distinct forms of historical analysis possible First analysis at the level   209 of formalization it is this history that mathematics never ceases to recount about itself in the process of its own development What it possesses at a given moment its domain its methods the objects that it defines the language that it employs is never thrown back into the external field of nonscientificity but is constantly undergoing redefinition if only as an area that has fallen into disuse or temporary sterility in the formal structure that mathematics constitutes this past is revealed as a particular case a naive model a partial and insufficiently generalized sketch of a more abstract or more powerful theory or one existing at a higher level mathematics retranscribes its real historical trajectory into the vocabulary of vicinities dependences subordinations progressive formalizations and selfenveloping generalities For this history of mathematics the history that is constituted by mathematics itself and which mathematics recounts about itself the algebra of Diophantus is not an experience that remains in suspense it is a particular case of Algebra as we have known it since Abel and Galois the Greek method of exhaustions was not an impasse that had to be escaped from it is a naive model of integral calculus Each historical event has its own formal level and localization This is a recurrential analysis which can be carried out only within a constituted science one that has crossed its threshold of formalization The second type of historical analysis is situated at the threshold of scientificity and questions itself as to the way in which it was crossed on the basis of various epistemological figures Its purpose is to discover for example how a concept  still overlaid with metaphors or imaginary contents  was purified and accorded the status and function of a scientific concept To discover how a region of experience that has already been mapped already partially articulated but is still overlaid with immediate practical uses or values related to those uses was constituted as a scientific domain To discover how in general a science was established over and against a prescientific level which both paved the way and resisted it in advance how it succeeded in overcoming the obstacles and limitations that still stood in its way G Bachelard and G Canguilhem have provided models of this kind of history Unlike recurrential analysis it has no need to situate itself within the  footnote   Michel Serres Hermes ou la communication p 78 210   science itself to redistribute every episode in its construction to recount its formalization in the formal vocabulary that it still possesses today indeed how could it do so since it shows what the science has freed itself from everything that it has had to leave behind in its progress towards the threshold of scientificity Consequently this description takes as its norm the fully constituted science the history that it recounts is necessarily concerned with the opposition of truth and error the rational and the irrational the obstacle and fecundity purity and impurity the scientific and the nonscientific It is an epistemological history of the sciences The third type of historical analysis takes as its point of attack the threshold of epistemologization  the point of cleavage between discursive formations defined by their positivity and epistemological figures that are not necessarily all sciences and which may never in fact succeed in becoming sciences At this level scientificity does not serve as a norm in this archaeological history what one is trying to uncover are discursive practices in so far as they give rise to a corpus of knowledge in so far as they assume the status and role of a science To undertake a history of the sciences at this level is not to describe discursive formations without regard to epistemological structures it is to show how the establishment of a science and perhaps its transition to formalization have come about in a discursive formation and in modifications to its positivity Such an analysis sets out therefore to outline the history of the sciences on the basis of a description of discursive practices to define how in accordance with which regularity and as a result of which modification it was able to give rise to the processes of epistemologization to attain the norms of scientificity and perhaps to reach the threshold of formalization In seeking the level of discursive practice in the historical density of the sciences one is not trying to place the discursive practice at some deep original level one is not trying to place it at the level of lived experience on this earth which is given irregular and fragmented before all geometry in the heaven that glitters through the grid of all astronomies  one is trying to reveal between positivities knowledge epistemological figures and sciences a whole set of differences relations gaps shifts independences autonomies and the way in which they articulate their own historicities on one another   211 The analysis of discursive formations of positivities and knowledge in their relations with epistemological figures and with the sciences is what has been called to distinguish it from other possible forms of the history of the sciences the analysis of the episteme This episteme may be suspected of being something like a worldview a slice of history common to all branches of knowledge which imposes on each one the same norms and postulates a general stage of reason a certain structure of thought that the men of a particular period cannot escape  a great body of legislation written once and for all by some anonymous hand By episteme we mean in fact the total set of relations that unite at a given period the discursive practices that give rise to epistemological figures sciences and possibly formalized systems the way in which in each of these discursive formations the transitions to epistemologization scientificity and formalization are situated and operate the distribution of these thresholds which may coincide be subordinated to one another or be separated by shifts in time the lateral relations that may exist between epistemological figures or sciences in so far as they belong to neighbouring but distinct discursive practices The episteme is not a form of knowledge connaissance or type of rationality which crossing the boundaries of the most varied sciences manifests the sovereign unity of a subject a spirit or a period it is the totality of relations that can be discovered for a given period between the sciences when one analyses them at the level of discursive regularities The description of the episteme presents several essential characteristics therefore it opens up an inexhaustible field and can never be closed its aim is not to reconstitute the system of postulates that governs all the branches of knowledge connaissances of a given period but to cover an indefinite field of relations Moreover the episteme is not a motionless figure that appeared one day with the mission of effacing all that preceded it it is a constantly moving set of articulations shifts and coincidences that are established only to give rise to others As a set of relations between sciences epistemological figures positivities and discursive practices the episteme makes it possible to grasp the set of constraints and limitations which at a given moment are imposed on discourse but this limitation is not the negative limitation that opposes knowledge connaissance to ignorance reasoning to imagination armed experience to fidelity to appearances and fantasy to inferences and   212 deductions the episteme is not what may be known at a given period due account taken of inadequate techniques mental attitudes or the limitations imposed by tradition it is what in the positivity of discursive practices makes possible the existence of epistemological figures and sciences Lastly we see that the analysis of the episteme is not a way of returning to the critical question given the existence of something like a science what is its legitimacy it is a questioning that accepts the fact of science only in order to ask the question what it is for that science to be a science In the enigma of scientific discourse what the analysis of the episteme questions is not its right to be a science but the fact that it exists And the point at which it separates itself off from all the philosophies of knowledge connaissance is that it relates this fact not to the authority of an original act of giving which establishes in a transcendental subject the fact and the right but to the processes of a historical practice f OTHER ARCHAEOLOG I ES One question remains in suspense could one conceive of an archaeological analysis that would reveal the regularity of a body of knowledge but which would not set out to analyse it in terms of epistemological figures and sciences Is an orientation towards the episteme the only one open to archaeology Must archaeology be  exclusively  a certain way of questioning the history of the sciences In other words by confirming itself up to now to the region of scientific discourses has archaeology been governed by some insuperable necessity  or has it provided an outline on the basis of a particular example of forms of analysis that may have a much wider application At the moment I am not sufficiently advanced in my task to answer this question But I can readily imagine  subject to a great deal of further exploration and examination  archaeologies that might develop in different directions There is for example the archaeological description of sexuality And I can see very well how it might be orientated towards the episteme one would show how in the nineteenth century such epistemological figures as the biology and psychology of sexuality were formed and how a discourse of a scientific type was established through the rupture brought about by Freud But I 213 can also see another possible direction for analysis instead of studying the sexual behaviour of men at a given period by seeking its law in a social structure in a collective unconscious or in a certain moral attitude instead of describing what men thought of sexuality what religious interpretation they gave it to what extent they approved or disapproved of it what conflicts of opinion or morality it gave rise to one would ask oneself whether in this behaviour as in these representations a whole discursive practice is not at work whether sexuality quite apart from any orientation towards a scientific discourse is not a group of objects that can be talked about or that it is forbidden to talk about a field of possible enunciations whether in lyrical or legal language a group of concepts which can no doubt be presented in the elementary form of notions or themes a set of choices which may appear in the coherence of behavior or in systems of prescription  Such an archaeology would show if it succeeded in its task how the prohibitions exclusions limitations values freedoms and transgressions of sexuality all its manifestations verbal or otherwise are linked to a particular discursive practice It would reveal not of course as the ultimate truth of sexuality but as one of the dimensions in accordance with which one can describe it a certain way of speaking and one would show how this way of speaking is invested not in scientific discourses but in a system of prohibitions and values An analysis that would be carried out not in the direction of the episteme but in that of what we might call the ethical But here is an example of another possible orientation In analysing a painting one can reconstitute the latent discourse of the painter one can try to recapture the murmur of his intentions which are not transcribed into words but into lines surfaces and colours one can try to uncover the implicit philosophy that is supposed to form his view of the world It is also possible to question science or at least the opinions of the period and to try to recognize to what extent they appear in the painters work Archaeological analysis would have another aim it would try to discover whether space distance depth colour light proportions volumes and contours were not at the period in question considered named enunciated and conceptualized in a discursive practice and whether the knowledge that this discursive practice gives rise to was not embodied perhaps in theories and   214 speculations in forms of teaching and codes of practice but also in processes techniques and even in the very gesture of the painter It would not set out to show that the painting is a certain way of meaning or saying that is peculiar in that it dispenses with words It would try to show that at least in one of its dimensions it is discursive practice that is embodied in techniques and effects In this sense the painting is not a pure vision that must then he transcribed into the materiality of space nor is it a naked gesture whose silent and eternally empty meanings must be freed from subsequent interpretations It is shot through  and independently of scientific knowledge connaissance and philosophical themes  with the positivity of a knowledge savoir It seems to me that one might also carry out an analysis of the same type on political knowledge One would try to show whether the political behavior of a society a group or a class is not shot through with a particular describable discursive practice This positivity would obviously not coincide either with the political theories of the period or with economic determinations it would define the element in politics that can become an object of enunciation the forms that this enunciation may take the concepts that are employed in it and the strategic choices that are made in it Instead of analysing this knowledge  which is always possible  in the direction of the episteme that it can give rise to one would analyse it in the direction of behaviour struggles conflicts decisions and tactics One would thus reveal a body of political knowledge that is not some kind of secondary theorizing about practice nor the application of theory Since it is regularly formed by a discursive practice that is deployed among other practices and is articulated upon them it is not an expression that more or less adequately reflects a number of objective data or real practices It is inscribed from the outset in the field of different practices in which it finds its specificity its functions and its network of dependences If such a description were possible there would be no need of course to pass through the authority of an individual or collective consciousness in order to grasp the place of articulation of a political practice and theory there would he no need to try to discover to what extent this consciousness may on the one hand express silent conditions and on the other show that it is susceptible to theoretical truths one would not need to pose the psychological problem of an act of consciousness  215 prise de conscience instead one would analyse the formation and transformations of a body of knowledge The question for example would not be to determine from what moment a revolutionary consciousness appears nor the respective roles of economic conditions and theoretical elucidations in the genesis of this consciousness it would not attempt to retrace the general and exemplary biography of revolutionary man or to find the origins of his project but it would try to explain the formation of a discursive practice and a body of revolutionary knowledge that are expressed in behaviour and strategies which give rise to a theory of society and which operate the interference and mutual transformation of that behaviour and those strategies To the questions posed above  Is archaeology concerned only with sciences Is it always an analysis of scientific discourse  we can now give a reply in each case in the negative What archaeology tries to describe is not the specific structure of science but the very different domain of knowledge Moreover although it is concerned with knowledge in its relation to epistemological figures and the sciences it may also question knowledge in a different direction and describe it in a different set of relations The orientation towards the episteme has been the only one to be explored so far The reason for this is that because of a gradient that no doubt characterizes our cultures discursive formations are constantly becoming epistemologized It is by questioning the sciences their history their strange unity their dispersion and their ruptures that the domain of positivities was able to appear it is in the interstice of scientific discourses that we were able to grasp the play of discursive formations It is hardly surprising therefore that the most fruitful region the one most open to archaeological description should have been that Classical age which from the Renaissance to the nineteenth century saw the epistemologization of so many positivities nor is it surprising that the discursive formations and specific regularities of knowledge are outlined precisely where the levels of scientificity and formalization were most difficult to attain But that was no more than a preferential point of attack it is not for archaeology an obligatory domain   219   Part V Conclusion CONCLUSION Throughout this book you have been at great pains to dissociate yourself from structuralism or at least from what is ordinarily understood by that term You have tried to show that you used neither the methods nor the concepts of structuralism that you make no reference to the procedures of linguistic description that you are not concerned with formalization But what do these differences amount to if not that you have failed to avail yourself of what is most positive most rigorous and most revealing in structural analysis That the domain that you have tried to deal with is not susceptible to this kind of enterprise and that its richness has constantly eluded the schemata in which you wished to enclose it And with apparent unconcern you are now trying to disguise the impotence of your method you are now presenting as an explicitly intended difference the unconquerable distance that separates you and will always separate you from a true structural analysis For you have not managed to deceive us It is true that in the void left by the methods that you have chosen not to use you have precipitated a whole series of notions that seem quite alien to the concepts now accepted by those who describe languages myths or works of literature you have spoken of formations positivities knowledge discursive practices a whole panoply of terms whose uniqueness and   220 marvellous powers you were proud to point out at every step But would you have invented so many oddities if you had not tried to apply in a domain that was irreducible to them some of the fundamental themes of structuralism  and those very themes that constitute its most debatable and philosophically dubious postulates It is as if you had used not the empirical serious work of structural analysis but two or three themes that are really extrapolations rather than necessary principles You have tried to reduce the dimensions proper to discourse ignore its specific irregularity hide what initiative and freedom it possesses and make up for the imbalance that it sets up within the language longue you have tried to close this openness Like a certain form of linguistics you have tried to dispense with the speaking subject you believed that one could cut off from discourse all its anthropological references and treat it as if it had never been formulated by anyone as if it had not come about in particular circumstances as if it were not imbued with representations as if it were addressed to no one Lastly you have applied to it a principle of simultaneity you have refused to see that discourse unlike the language longue perhaps is essentially historical that it was made up not of available elements but of real successive events that it cannot be analysed outside the time in which it occurred  You are quite right I misunderstood the transcendence of discourse in describing it I refused to refer it to a subjectivity I did not give primary consideration as if it ought to be its general form to its diachronic character But this was not intended to extend beyond the domain of the language longue concepts and methods that had been tested within it If I spoke of discourse it was not to show that the mechanisms or processes of the language longue were entirely preserved in it but rather to reveal in the density of verbal performances the diversity of the possible levels of analysis to show that in addition to methods of linguistic structuration or interpretation one could draw up a specific description of statements of their formation and of the regularities proper to discourse If I suspended all reference to the speaking subject it was not to discover laws of construction or forms that could be applied in the same way by all speaking subjects nor was   221 it to give voice to the great universal discourse that is common to all men at a particular period On the contrary my aim was to show what the differences consisted of how it was possible for men within the same discursive practice to speak of different objects to have contrary opinions and to make contradictory choices my aim was also to show in what way discursive practices were distinguished from one another in short I wanted not to exclude the problem of the subject but to define the positions and functions that the subject could occupy in the diversity of discourse Lastly as you have observed I did not deny history but held in suspense the general empty category of change in order to reveal transformations at different levels I reject a uniform model of temporalization in order to describe for each discursive practice its rules of accumulation exclusion reactivation its own forms of derivation and its specific modes of connexion over various successions So I did not wish to carry the structuralist enterprise beyond its legitimate limits And you must admit that I never once used the word structure in The Order of Things But let us leave off our polemics about structuralism they hardly survive in areas now deserted by serious workers this particular controversy which might have been so fruiftul is now acted out only by mimes and tumblers  Its no use trying to avoid these polemics you wont escape the problem so easily For the problem does not concern structuralism I recognize the value of its insights of course when it is a question of analysing a language longue mythologies folktales poems dreams works of literature even films perhaps structural description reveals relations that could not otherwise be isolated it makes it possible to define recurrent elements with their forms of opposition and their criteria of individualization it also makes it possible to lay down laws of construction equivalences and rules of transformation And despite a number of reservations that I had at the beginning I now have no difficulty in accepting that mans languages longues his unconscious and his imagination are governed by laws of structure But what I absolutely cannot accept is what you are doing I cannot accept that one can analyse scientific discourses in their succession without referring them to something like a constituent activity without recognizing   222 even in their hesitations the opening of an original project or a fundamental teleology without discovering the profound continuity that links them and leads them to the point at which we can grasp them I cannot accept that one can analyse the development of reason in this way and free the history of thought from all taint of subjectivity Let us examine the problem more closely I agree that one can speak in terms of elements and rules of construction of language longue in general  at least of that language of other times and places which is that of myths or even of that nevertheless rather strange language which is that of our unconscious or of our literary works but the language of our knowledge that language which we are using here and now the structural discourse itself that enables us to analyse so many other languages langages that language which in its historical density we regard as irreducible You surely cannot forget that it is on the basis of that language with its slow genesis and the obscure development that has brought it to its present state that we can speak of other discourses in terms of structures it is that language which has given us the possibility and the right to do so it forms the blind spot on the basis of which things around us are arranged as we see them today I dont mind one dealing with elements relations and discontinuities when analysing IndoEuropean myths or the tragedies of Racine and I can even accept that one should dispense as far as one can with a discussion of the speaking subjects but I dispute that these successes give one the right to turn the analysis back on to the forms of discourse that made them possible and to question the very locus in which we are speaking today The history of those analyses in which subjectivity eludes one retains its own transcendence  It seems to me that the difference between us lies there much more than in the overdiscussed question of structuralism As you know I have no great liking for interpretation but allow me as a kind of game to say what I understand you to have said earlier Of course you say we must now admit despite all the attacks of the arrieregarde that one formalizes deductive discourses of course we have to admit that one describes not so much the history of a soul not so much a project of existence as the architecture of a philosophical system of course whatever we think about it we have to tolerate those analyses  223 that link literary oeuvres not to the lived experience of an individual but to the structures of the language longue Of course we have had to abandon all those discourses that once led us to the sovereignty of consciousness But what we have lost over the last halfcentury we are hoping to recover in the second degree by means of the analysis of those analyses or at least by the fundamental questioning that we apply to them We will ask them where they came from towards what historical destination they are moving without being aware of it what naivety blinds them to the conditions that make them possible and what metaphysical enclosure encloses their rudimentary positivism And so in the end it will not matter that the unconscious is not as we believed and affirmed the implicit edge of consciousness it will not matter that a mythology is no longer a worldview and that a novel is something other than the outer slope of a lived experience for the reason that establishes all these new truths is under strict supervision neither itself nor its past nor that which makes it possible nor that which makes it ours escapes the attribution of transcendence For it is to it now  and we are determined never to abandon this  that we will now pose the question of the origin the first constitution the teleological horizon temporal continuity It is that thought which is now becoming ours that we will maintain in historicotranscendental dominance That is why if we must tolerate all these structuralisms whether we like it or not we will not allow any taint to that history of thought that is our own history we will not allow the unravelling of those transcendental threads that have hound it since the nineteenth century to the problem of origin and subjectivity To whomsoever approaches that fortress in which we have taken refuge and which we are determined to defend and to hold we repeat with a gesture that wards off all profanation Noli tangere But I have obstinately gone on Not that I am either certain of victory or sure of my weapons But because it seemed to me that for the moment the essential task was to free the history of thought from its subjection to transcendence For me the problem was certainly not how to structuralize it by applying to the development of knowledge or to the genesis of the sciences categories that had proved themselves in the domain of language longue My aim was to analyse this history in the discontinuity that no teleology would reduce in advance to map   224 it in a dispersion that no preestablished horizon would embrace to allow it to be deployed in an anonymity on which no transcendental constitution would impose the form of the subject to open it up to a temporality that would not promise the return of any dawn My aim was to cleanse it of all transcendental narcissism it had to be freed from that circle of the lost origin and rediscovered where it was imprisoned it had to be shown that the history of thought could not have this role of revealing the transcendental moment that rational mechanics has not possessed since Kant mathematical idealities since Husserl and the meanings of the perceived world since MerleauPonty  despite the efforts that had been made to find it here And I think that really despite the element of doubt introduced by our apparent dispute over structuralism we understood each other perfectly I mean each of us understood perfectly what the other was trying to do It is quite normal that you should defend the rights of a continuous history open both to the application of a teleology and to the endless processes of causality but it was not to protect it from a structural invasion that failed to recognize its movement spontaneity and internal dynamism in fact you were trying to preserve the powers of a constituent consciousness since it was really they that were in question But this defence was to take place elsewhere and not in the same place as the discussion itself for if you recognize the right of a piece of empirical research some fragment of history to challenge the transcendental dimension then you have ceded the main point Hence a series of shifts or displacements To treat archaeology as a search for the origin for formal a prioris for founding acts in short as a sort of historical phenomenology when on the contrary its aim is to free history from the grip of phenomenology and then to object that it fails in its task and that it never discovers more than a series of empirical facts Then to contrast archaeological description and its concern to establish thresholds ruptures and transformations with the true work of historians which is to reveal continuities when this ceased to be the concern of historians decades ago and then to reproach it for its lack of concern for empiricities And then to regard it as an enterprise whose aim is to describe cultural totalities to homogenize the most obvious differences and to rediscover the universality of constrictive forms when its aim is to define the unique specificity of  225 discursive practices and then to object to differences changes and mutations Lastly to regard it as an importation of structuralism into the domain of history when its methods and concepts cannot possibly be confused with structuralism and then to show that it cannot function as a true structural analysis This whole play of displacements and misunderstandings is perfectly coherent and necessary It brought with it a secondary benefit being able to approach from an oblique angle all those forms of structuralism that had to be tolerated and that could no longer be resisted and to say to them You see what youll expose yourselves to if you touch those domains that are still ours your methods may have some validity elsewhere but they would soon be brought to recognize their limitations all the concrete content that you would like to analyse would elude them you would be forced to give up your prudent empiricism and against your will you would fall into a strange ontology of structure So be prudent enough to keep to those domains which you have no doubt conquered but which we will pretend to have conceded to you since we have fixed their boundaries But the major benefit of course is that it conceals the crisis in which we have been involved for so long and which is constantly growing more serious a crisis that concerns that transcendental reflexion with which philosophy since Kant has identified itself which concerns that theme of the origin that promise of the return by which we avoid the difference of our present which concerns an anthropological thought that orders all these questions around the question of mans being and allows us to avoid an analysis of practice which concerns all humanist ideologies which above all concerns the status of the subject It is this discussion that you would like to suppress and from which you hope I think to divert attention by pursuing the pleasant games of genesis and system synchrony and development relation and cause structure and history Are you sure you are not practising a theoretical metathesis  Let us suppose that our dispute is where you say it is let us suppose that our aims are to attack or to defend the last bastion of transcendental thought and let us admit that this discussion is in fact situated in the crisis you describe what then is the title of your discourse Where does it come from and from where does it derive its  226 right to speak How could it be legitimated If you have done nothing more than carry out an empirical inquiry devoted to the appearance and transformation of discourses if you have described groups of statements epistemological figures the historical forms of a body of knowledge how can you escape the naivety of all positivisms And how could your enterprise prevail against the question of origin and the necessary recourse to a constituent subject But if you claim that you are opening up a radical interrogation if you wish to place your discourse at the level at which we place ourselves you know very well that it will enter our game and in turn extend the very dimension that it is trying to free itself from Either it does not reach us or we claim it In any case you have promised to tell us what these discourses are that you have been pursuing so obstinately for the past ten years without ever bothering to define their status In short what are they history or philosophy  I admit that this question embarrasses me more than your earlier objections I am not entirely surprised by it but I would have preferred to leave it in suspense a little longer This is because for the moment and as far ahead as I can see my discourse far from determining the locus in which it speaks is avoiding the ground on which it could find support It is a discourse about discourses but it is not trying to find in them a hidden law a concealed origin that it only remains to free nor is it trying to establish by itself taking itself as a startingpoint the general theory of which they would be the concrete models It is trying to deploy a dispersion that can never be reduced to a single system of differences a scattering that is not related to absolute axes of reference it is trying to operate a decentring that leaves no privilege to any centre The role of such a discourse is not to dissipate oblivion to rediscover in the depths of things said at the very place in which they are silent the moment of their birth whether this is seen as their empirical creation or the transcendental act that gives them origin it does not set out to be a recollection of the original or a memory of the truth On the contrary its task is to make differences to constitute them as objects to analyse them and to define their concept Instead of travelling over the field of discourses in order to recreate the suspended totalizations for its own use instead of seeking in what has been said that other 227 hidden discourse which nevertheless remains the same and instead of playing endlessly with allegory and tautology it is continually making differentiations it is a diagnosis If philosophy is memory or a return of the origin what I am doing cannot in any way be regarded as philosophy and if the history of thought consists in giving life to halfeffaced figures what I am doing is not history either  From what you have just said one must at least deduce that your archaeology is not a science You allow it to fluctuate with the uncertain status of a description Yet another of those discourses that would like to be taken as a discipline still in its early stages no doubt which gives their authors the double advantage of not having to establish their explicit rigorous scientificity and of opening up for it a future generality that frees it from the hazards of its birth yet another of those projects that justify themselves on the basis of what they are not always leaving their essential task the moment of their verification and the definitive establishment of their coherence until later yet another of those foundations so many of which have been announced since the nineteenth century for we know very well that in the modern theoretical field what one is pleased to invent are not demonstrable systems but disciplines for which one opens up possibilities outlines a programme and leaves its future development to others But no sooner have they been outlined than they disappear together with their authors And the field that they were supposed to tend remains sterile for ever  It is true that I have never presented archaeology as a science or even as the beginnings of a future science And I have tried to draw up a survey  and in the process to make a good many corrections  of the work that I had done in certain fields of concrete research rather than produce plans for some future building The word archaeology is not supposed to carry any suggestion of anticipation it simply indicates a possible line of attack for the analysis of verbal performances the specification of a level  that of the statement and the archive the determination and illumination of a domain  the enunciative regularities the positivities the application of such concepts as rules of formation archaeological derivation and historical a priori But in almost all   228 its dimensions and over almost all its crests the enterprise is related to the sciences and to analyses of a scientific type or to theories subject to rigorous criteria First of all it is related to the sciences that are constituted and establish their norms in the knowledge archaeologically described for the archaeological enterprise these sciences are so many scienceobjects as morbid anatomy philology political economy and biology have already been It is also related to scientific forms of analysis but is distinguished from them either in level domain or methods and juxtaposed to them by characteristic lines of division by seizing out of the mass of things said upon the statement defined as a function of realization of the verbal performance it distinguishes itself from a search whose privileged field is linguistic competence while such a description constitutes a generative model in order to define the acceptability of statements archaeology tries to establish rules of formation in order to define the conditions of their realization between these two modes of analysis there are therefore a number of analogies but there are also a number of differences in particular concerning the possible level of formalization  in any case for archaeology a generative grammar plays the role of a related analysis Moreover in their deployment and in the fields that they cover archaeological descriptions are articulated upon other disciplines in seeking to define outside all reference to a psychological or constituent subjectivity the different positions of the subject that may be involved in statements archaeology touches on a question that is being posed today by psychoanalysis in trying to reveal the rules of formation of concepts the modes of succession connexion and coexistence of statements it touches on the problem of epistemological structures in studying the formation of objects the fields in which they emerge and are specified in studying too the conditions of appropriation of discourses it touches on the analysis of social formations For archaeology these are so many correlative spaces Lastly in so far as it is possible to constitute a general theory of productions archaeology as the analysis of the rules proper to the different discursive practices will find what might be called its enveloping theory If I situate archaeology among so many other already constituted discourses it is not in order to give it some kind of status by association that it would be incapable of acquiring in isolation it is not in order to   229 give it a definitive place in an unmoving constellation but in order to reveal with the archive the discursive formations the positivities the statements and their conditions of formation a specific domain A domain that has not so far been made the object of any analysis at least of what is most specific and most irreducible to interpretations and formalizations about it but a domain that has no means of guaranteeing  at the still rudimentary stage of mapping at which I am at present  that it will remain stable and autonomous After all it may be that archaeology is doing nothing more than playing the role of an instrument that makes it possible to articulate in a less imprecise way than in the past the analysis of social formations and epistemological descriptions or which makes it possible to relate an analysis of the positions of the subject to a theory of the history of the sciences or which makes it possible to situate the place of intersection between a general theory of production and a generative analysis of statements Lastly it may turn out that archaeology is the name given to a part of our contemporary theoretical conjuncture Whether this conjuncture is giving rise to an individualizable discipline whose initial characteristics and overall limits are being outlined here or whether it is giving rise to a set of problems whose present coherence does not mean that it will not be taken up later elsewhere in a different way at a higher level or using different methods I am in no position at the moment to decide And to tell you the truth it is probably not up to me to decide I accept that my discourse may disappear with the figure that has borne it so far  You make curious use of the freedom that you question in others For you give yourself the whole field of a free space that you even refuse to qualify But are you forgetting the care with which you enclosed the discourse of others within systems of rules Are you forgetting all those constraints that you described so meticulously Have you not deprived individuals of the right to intervene personally in the positivities in which their discourses are situated You have linked their slightest words to obligations that condemn their slightest innovations to conformity You make revolution very easy for yourself but very difficult for others It might he better if you had a clearer awareness of the conditions in which you speak and a greater confidence in the real action of men and in their possibilities   230 Im afraid you are making a double mistake about the discursive practices that I have tried to define and about the role that you yourself accord to human freedom The positivities that I have tried to establish must not be understood as a set of determinations imposed from the outside on the thought of individuals or inhabiting it from the inside in advance as it were they constitute rather the set of conditions in accordance with which a practice is exercised in accordance with which that practice gives rise to partially or totally new statements and in accordance with which it can be modified These positivities are not so much limitations imposed on the initiative of subjects as the field in which that initiative is articulated without however constituting its centre rules that it puts into operation without it having invented or formulated them relations that provide it with a support without it being either their final result or their point of convergence It is an attempt to reveal discursive practices in their complexity and density to show that to speak is to do something  something other than to express what one thinks to translate what one knows and something other than to play with the structures of a language longue to show that to add a statement to a preexisting series of statements is to perform a complicated and costly gesture which involves conditions and not only a situation a context and motives and rules not the logical and linguistic rules of construction to show that a change in the order of discourse does not presuppose new ideas a little invention and creativity a different mentality but transformations in a practice perhaps also in neighbouring practices and in their common articulation I have not denied  far from it  the possibility of changing discourse I have deprived the sovereignty of the subject of the exclusive and instantaneous right to it And now I should like to ask you a question how do you see change or let us say revolution at least in the scientific order and in the field of discourses if you link it with the themes of meaning project origin and return constituent subject in short with the entire thematic that ensures for history the universal presence of the Logos What possibility do you accord it if you analyse it in accordance with dynamic biological evolutionist metaphors in which the difficult specific problem of historical mutation is usually dissolved More precisely still what political status can you give to discourse if you see   231 in it merely a thin transparency that shines for an instant at the limit of things and thoughts Has not the practice of revolutionary discourse and scientific discourse in Europe over the past two hundred years freed you from this idea that words are wind an external whisper a beating of wings that one has difficulty in hearing in the serious matter of history Or must we conclude that in order to refuse this lesson you are determined to misunderstand discursive practices in their own existence and that you wished to maintain in spite of that lesson a history of the mind of rational knowledge ideas and opinions What is that fear which makes you reply in terms of consciousness when someone talks to you about a practice its conditions its rules and its historical transformations What is that fear which makes you seek beyond all boundaries ruptures shifts and divisions the great historicotranscendental destiny of the Occident It seems to me that the only reply to this question is a political one But let us leave that to one side for today Perhaps we will take it up again soon in another way This book was written simply in order to overcome certain preliminary difficulties I know as well as anyone how thankless is the task that I undertook some ten years ago I know how irritating it can he to treat discourses in terms not of the gentle silent intimate consciousness that is expressed in them but of an obscure set of anonymous rules How unpleasant it is to reveal the limitations and necessities of a practice where one is used to seeing in all its pure transparency the expression of genius and freedom How provocative it is to treat as a set of transformations this history of discourses which until now has been animated by the reassuring metaphors of life or the intentional continuity of the lived How unbearable it is in view of how much of himself everyone wishes to put thinks he is putting of himself into his own discourse when he speaks how unbearable it is to cut up analyse combine rearrange all these texts that have now returned from silence without ever the transfigured face of the author appearing What All those words piled up one after another all those marks made on all that paper and presented to innumerable pairs of eyes all that concern to make them survive beyond the gesture that articulated them so much piety expended in preserving them and inscribing them in mens memories  all that and nothing remaining of the poor   232 hand that traced them of the anxiety that sought appeasement in them of that completed life that has nothing but them to survive in Is not discourse in its most profound determination a trace And is its murmur not the place of insubstantial immortalities Must we admit that the time of discourse is not the time of consciousness extrapolated to the dimensions of history or the time of history present in the form of consciousness Must I suppose that in my discourse I can have no survival And that in speaking I am not banishing my death but actually establishing it or rather that I am abolishing all interiority in that exterior that is so indifferent to my life and so neutral that it makes no distinction between my life and my death I understand the unease of all such people They have probably found it difficult enough to recognize that their history their economics their social practices the language langue that they speak the mythology of their ancestors even the stories that they were told in their childhood are governed by rules that are not all given to their consciousness they can hardly agree to being dispossessed in addition of that discourse in which they wish to be able to say immediately and directly what they think believe or imagine they prefer to deny that discourse is a complex differentiated practice governed by analysable rules and transformations rather than be deprived of that tender consoling certainty of being able to change if not the world if not life at least their meaning simply with a fresh word that can come only from themselves and remain for ever close to the source So many things have already eluded them in their language langage they have no wish to see what they say go the same way at all costs they must preserve that tiny fragement of discourse  whether written or spoken  whose fragile uncertain existence must perpetuate their lives They cannot bear and one cannot but sympathize to hear someone saying Discourse is not life its time is not your time in it you will not be reconciled to death you may have killed God beneath the weight of all that you have said but dont imagine that with all that you are saying you will make a man that will live longer than he INDEX a priori 8 Abel N 209 accounts book 93 accumulation 13841 actuality domain 68 Adanson M 65 66 177 adverb 92 age pyramid 93

RITUALS the sacrificial act assumes two      opposing aspects appearing at times as a sacred obligation to be neglected at grave peril at other times as a sort of criminal activity entailing perils of equal gravity To account for this dual aspect of ritual sacrificethe legitimate and the illegitimate the public and the all but covertHenri Hubert and Marcel Mauss in their Essay on the Nature and Function of Sacrifice1 adduce the sacred character of the victim Because the victim is sacred it is criminal to kill himbut the victim is sacred only because he is to be killed Here is a circular line of reasoning that at a somewhat later date would be dignified by the sonorous term ambivalence Persuasive and authoritative as that term still appears it has been so extraordinarily abused in our century that perhaps we may now recognize how little light it sheds on the subject of sacrifice Certainly it provides no real explanation When we speak of ambivalence we are only pointing out a problem that remains to be solved If sacrifice resembles criminal violence we may say that there is inversely hardly any form of violence that cannot be described in terms of sacrificeas Greek tragedy clearly reveals It has often been observed that the tragic poets cast a glimmering veil of rhetoric over the sordid realities of life True enoughbut sacrifice and murder would not lend themselves to this game of reciprocal substitution if they were not in some way related Although it is so obvious that it may hardly seem worth mentioning where sacrifice is concerned first appearances count for little are quickly brushed asideand should therefore receive special attention Once one has made up ones mind that sacrifice is an institution essentially if not entirely symbolic one can say anything whatsoever about it It is a subject that lends itself to insubstantial theorizing Sacrifice contains an element of mystery And if the pieties of classical humanists lull our curiosity to sleep the company of the ancient 1 Henri Hubert and Marcel Mauss Sacrifice Its Nature and Function Chicago 1968 2 Violence and the Sacred authors keeps it alert The ancient mystery remains as impenetrable as ever From the manner in which the moderns treat the subject of sacrifice it would be hard to know whether distraction detachment or some sort of secret discretion shapes their thinking There seems to be yet another mystery here Why for example do we never explore the relationship between sacrifice and violence Recent studies suggest that the physiology of violence varies little from one individual to another even from one culture to another According to Anthony Storr nothing resembles an angry cat or man so much as another angry cat or man2 If violence did indeed play a role in sacrifice at least at one particular stage of the ritual we would have a significant clue to the whole subject Here would be a factor to some extent independent of those cultural variables that are often unknown to us or only dimly known or perhaps less familiar than we like to think Once aroused the urge to violence triggers certain physical changes that prepare mens bodies for battle This set toward violence lingers on it should not be regarded as a simple reflex that ceases with the removal of the initial stimulus Storr remarks that it is more difficult to quell an impulse toward violence than to rouse it especially within the normal framework of social behavior Violence is frequently called irrational It has its reasons however and can marshal some rather convincing ones when the need arises Yet these reasons cannot be taken seriously no matter how valid they may appear Violence itself will discard them if the initial object remains persistently out of reach and continues to provoke hostility When unappeased violence seeks and always finds a surrogate victim The creature that excited its fury is abruptly replaced by another chosen only because it is vulnerable and close at hand There are many indications that this tendency to seek out surrogate objects is not limited to human violence Konrad Lorenz makes reference to a species of fish that if deprived of its natural enemies the male rivals with whom it habitually disputes territorial rights turns its aggression against the members of its own family and destroys them3 Joseph de Maistre discusses the choice of animal victims that display human characteristicsan attempt as it were to deceive the violent impulse The sacrificial animals were always those most prized for their usefulness the gentlest most innocent creatures whose habits and instincts brought them most closely into harmony with man    2 Anthony Storr Human Aggression New York 1968 3 Konrad Lorenz On Aggression trans iYiarjorie Kerr Wilson New York 1966 Sacrifice  From the animal realm were chosen as victims those who were if we might use the phrase the most human in nature4 Modern ethnology offers many examples of this sort of intuitive behavior In some pastoral communities where sacrifice is practiced the cattle are intimately associated with the daily life of the inhabitants Two peoples of the Upper Nile for examplethe Nuers observed by E E EvansPritchard and the Dinka studied at a somewhat later date by Godfrey Lienhardtmaintain a bovine society in their midst that parallels their own and is structured in the same fashion5 The Nuer vocabulary is rich in words describing the ways of cattle and covering the economic and practical as well as the poetic and ritualistic aspects of these beasts This wealth of expression makes possible a precise and finely nuanced relationship between the cattle on the one hand and the human community on the other The animals color the shape of their horns their age sex and lineage are all duly noted and remembered sometimes as far back as five generations The cattle are thereby differentiated in such a way as to create a scale of values that approximates human distinctions and represents a virtual duplicate of human society Among the names bestowed on each man is one that also belongs to the animal whose place in the herd is most similar to the place the man occupies in the tribe The quarrels between various subgroups of the tribes frequently involve cattle All fines and interest payments are computed in terms of head of cattle and dowries are apportioned in herds In fact EvansPritchard maintains that in order to understand the Nuer one must chercher la vachelook to the cows A sort of symbiosis the term is also EvansPritchards exists between this tribe and their cattle offering an extreme and almost grotesque example of the closeness that characteristically prevails between pastoral peoples and their flocks Fieldwork and subsequent theoretical speculation lead us back to the hypothesis of substitution as the basis for the practice of sacrifice This notion pervades ancient literature on the subjectwhich may be one reason in fact why many modern theorists reject the concept out of hand or give it only scant attention Hubert and Mauss for instance view the idea with suspicion undoubtedly because they feel that it

reference is cited SE E EvansPritchard The Nuer Oxford 1940 Godfrey Lienhardt Divinity and Experience The Religion oj the Dinka Oxford 1961 4 Violence and the Sacred introduces into the discussion religious and moral values that are incompatible with true scientific inquiry And to be sure Joseph de iMaistre takes the view that the ritual victim is an innocent creature who pays a debt for the guilty party I propose an hypothesis that does away with this moral distinction As 1 see it the relationship between the potential victim and the actual victim cannot be defined in terms of innocence or guilt There is no question of expiation Rather society is seeking to deflect upon a relatively indifferent victim a sacrificeable victim the violence that would otherwise be vented on its own members the people it most desires to protect The qualities that lend violence its particular terrorits blind brutality the fundamental absurdity of its manifestationshave a reverse side With these qualities goes the strange propensity to seize upon surrogate victims to actually conspire with the enemy and at the right moment toss him a morsel that will serve to satisfy his raging hunger The fairy tales of childhood in which the wolf ogre or dragon gobbles up a large stone in place of a small child could well be said to have a sacrificial cast t VIOLENCE IS NOT TO BE DENIED but it can be diverted to another object something it can sink its teeth into Such perhaps is one of the meanings of the story of Cain and Abel The Bible offers us no background on the two brothers except the bare fact that Cain is a tiller of the soil who gives the fruits of his labor to God whereas Abel is a shepherd who regularly sacrifices the firstborn of his herds One of the brothers kills the other and the murderer is the one who does not have the violenceoutlet of animal sacrifice at his disposal This difference between sacrificial and nonsacrificial cults determines in effect Gods judgement in favor of Abel To say that God accedes to Abels sacrificial offerings but rejects the offerings of Cain is simply another way of sayingfrom the viewpoint of the divinitythat Cain is a murderer whereas his brother is not A frequent motif in the Old Testament as well as in Greek myth is that of brothers at odds with one another Their fatal penchant for violence can only be diverted by the intervention of a third party the sacrificial victim or victims Cains jealousy of his brother is only another term for his one characteristic trait his lack of a sacrificial outlet According to Moslem tradition God delivered to Abraham the ram previously sacrificed by Abel This ram was to take the place of Abrahams son Isaac having already saved one human life the same animal would now save another What we have here is no mystical hocusSacrifice 5 pocus but an intuitive insight into the essential function of sacrifice gleaned exclusively from the scant references in the Bible xnother familiar biblical scene takes on new meaning in the light of our theory of sacrificial substitution and it can serve in turn to illuminate some aspects of the theory The scene is that in which Jacob receives the blessing of his father Isaac Isaac is an old man He senses the approach of death and summons his eldest son Esau on whom he intends to bestow his final blessing First however he instructs Esau to bring back some venison from the hunt so as to make a savory meat This request is overheard by the younger brother Jacob who hastens to report it to his mother Rebekah Rebekah takes two kids from the family flock slaughters them and prepares the savory meat dish which Jacob in the guise of his elder brother then presents to his father Isaac is blind Nevertheless Jacob fears he will be recognized for he is a smooth man while his brother Esau is a hairy man My father peradventure will feel me and I shall seem to him as a deceiver and I shall bring a curse upon me not a blessing Rebekah has the idea of covering Jacobs hands and the back of his neck with the skins of the slaughtered goats and when the old man runs his hands over his younger son he is completely taken in by the imposture Jacob receives the blessing that Isaac had intended for Esau The kids serve in two different ways to dupe the fatheror in other terms to divert from the son the violence directed toward him In order to receive his fathers blessing rather than his curse Jacob must present to Isaac the freshly slaughtered kids made into a savory meat Then the son must seek refuge literally in the skins of the sacrificed animals The animals thus interpose themselves between father and son They serve as a sort of insulation preventing the direct contact that could lead only to violence Two sorts of substitution are telescoped here that of one brother for another and that of an animal for a man Only the first receives explicit recognition in the text however this first one serves as the screen upon which the shadow of the second is projected Once we have focused attention on the sacrificial victim the object originally singled out for violence fades from view Sacrificial substitution implies a degree of misunderstanding Its vitality as an institution depends on its ability to conceal the displacement upon which the rite is based It must never lose sight entirely however of the original object or cease to be aware of the act of transference from that object to the surrogate victim without that awareness no substitution can take place and the sacrifice loses all efficacy The biblical passage dis6 Violence and the Sacred cussed above meets both requirements The narrative does not refer directly to the strange deception underlying the sacrificial substitution nor does it allow this deception to pass entirely unnoticed Rather it mixes the act of substitution with another act of substitution permitting us a fleeting sidelong glimpse of the process The narrative itself then might be said to partake of a sacrificial quality it claims to reveal one act of substitution while employing this first substitution to halfconceal another There is reason to believe that the narrative touches upon the mythic origins of the sacrificial system The figure of Jacob has long been linked with the devious character of sacrificial violence In Greek culture Odysseus plays a similar role The story of Jacobs benediction can be compared to the episode of the Cyclops in the Odyssey where a splendidly executed ruse enables the hero to escape the clutches of a monster Odysseus and his shipmates are shut up in the Cyclops cave Every day the giant devours one of the crew the survivors finally manage to blind their tormentor with a flaming stake Mad with pain and anger the Cyclops bars the entrance of the cave to prevent the men from escaping However he lets pass his flock of sheep which go out daily to pasture In a gesture reminiscent of the blind Isaac the Cyclops runs his hands over the back of each sheep as it leaves the cave to make sure that it carries no passenger Odysseus however has outwitted his captor and he rides to freedom by clinging to the thick wool on the underside of one of the rams A comparison of the two scenes one from Genesis and the other from the Odyssey lends credence to the theory of their sacrificial origins In each case an animal intervenes at the crucial moment to prevent violence from attaining its designated victim The two texts are mutually revealing the Cyclops of the Odyssey underlines the fearful menace that hangs over the hero and that remains obscure in the Genesis story and the slaughter of the kids in Genesis along with the offering of the savory meat clearly implies the sacrificial character of the flock an aspect that might go unnoticed in the Odyssey  SACRIFICE HAS OFTEN BEEN DESCRIBED as an act of mediation between a sacrificer and a deity Because the very concept of a deity much less a deity who receives blood sacrifices has little reality in this day and age the entire institution of sacrifice is relegated by most modern theorists to the realm of the imagination The approach of Hubert and Mauss leads to the judgement of Claude LeviStrauss in La Pensee sauvage because sacrificial rites have no basis in reality we have every reason to label them meaningless The attempt to link sacrifice to a nonexistent deity brings to mind Sacrifice 7 Paul Valerys description of poetry as a purely solipsistic activity practiced by the more able solely out of love for art while the less able persist in the belief that they are actually communicating with someone The two ancient narratives examined above make unmistakable reference to the act of sacrifice but neither makes so much as a passing mention of a deity If a god had intervened in either incident its significance would have been diminished rather than increased and the reader would have been led to conclude in accordance with the beliefs common to late antiquity and to the modern world that sacrifice has no real function in society Divine intervention would have meant the elimination of the pervasive aura of dread along with its firmly structured economy of violence We would have then been thrown back upon a formalistic critical approach that would in no way further our understanding As we have seen the sacrificial process requires a certain degree of misunderstanding The celebrants do not and must not comprehend the true role of the sacrificial act The theological basis of the sacrifice has a crucial role in fostering this misunderstanding It is the god who supposedly demands the victims he alone in principle who savors the smoke from the altars and requisitions the slaughtered flesh It is to appease his anger that the killing goes on that the victims multiply Interpreters who think they question the primacy of the divine sufficiently by declaring the whole affair imaginary may well remain the prisoners of the theology they have not really analyzed The problem then becomes how can a real institution be constructed on a purely illusory basis It is not to be wondered at if the outer shell finally gives way bringing down with it even the most solid aspects of the institution Instead of rejecting the theological basis outright qua abstraction which is the same in effect as passively accepting it let us expose its assumptions to a critical examination Let us try to uncover the societal conflicts that the sacrificial act and its theological interpretations at once dissimulate and appease We must break with the formalistic tradition of Hubert and Mauss The interpretation of sacrifice as an act of violence inflicted on a surrogate victim has recently been advanced once again Godfrey Lienhardt in Divinity and Experience and Victor Turner in a number of works especially The Drums of Affliction drawing from fieldwork portray sacrifice as practiced among the Dinka and the Ndernbu as a deliberate act of collective substitution performed at the expense of the victim and absorbing all the internal tensions feuds and rivalries pent up within the community 8 Violence and the Sacred Sacrifice plays a very real role in these societies and the problem of substitution concerns the entire community The victim is not a substitute for some particularly endangered individual nor is it offered up to some individual of particularly bloodthirsty temperament Rather it is a substitute for all the members of the community offered up by the members themselves The sacrifice serves to protect the entire community from its oiim violence it prompts the entire community to choose victims outside itself The elements of dissension scattered throughout the community are drawn to the person of the sacrificial victim and eliminated at least temporarily by its sacrifice If we turn our attention from the theological superstructure of the actthat is from an interpretive version of the event that is often accepted as the final statement on sacrificewe quickly perceive yet another level of religious discourse in theory subordinated to the theological dimension but in reality quite independent of it This has to do with the social function of the act an aspect far more accessible to the modern mind It is easy to ridicule a religion by concentrating on its more eccentric rites rites such as the sacrifices performed to induce rain or bring fine weather There is in fact no object or endeavor in whose name a sacrifice cannot be made especially when the social basis of the act has begun to blur Nevertheless there is a common denominator that determines the efficacy of all sacrifices and that becomes increasingly apparent as the institution grows in vigor This common denominator is internal violenceall the dissensions rivalries jealousies and quarrels within the community that the sacrifices are designed to suppress The purpose of the sacrifice is to restore harmony to the community to reinforce the social fabric Everything else derives from that If once we take this fundamental approach to sacrifice choosing the road that violence opens before us we can see that there is no aspect of human existence foreign to the subject not even material prosperity When men no longer live in harmony with one another the sun still shines and the rain falls to be sure but the fields are less well tended the harvests less abundant The classic literature of China explicitly acknowledges the propitiatory function of sacrificial rites Such practices pacify the country and make the people settled    It is through the sacrifices that the unity of the people is strengthened CHU YU II 2 The Book of Rites affirms that sacrificial ceremonies music punishments and laws have one and the same end to unite society and establish order6 In attempting to formulate the fundamental principles of sacrifice 6 A R RadcliffeBrown Structure and Function in Primitive Society Glencoe 11L 1952 p 158 Sacrifice 9 without reference to the ritualistic framework in which the sacrifice takes place we run the risk of appearing simplistic Such an effort smacks strongly of psychologizing1 Gearly it would be inexact to compare the sacrificial act to the spontaneous gesture of the man who kicks his dog because he dares not kick his wife or boss However there are Greek myths that are hardly more than colossal variants of such gestures Such a one is the story of Ajax Furious at the leaders of the Greek army who refused to award him Achilles weapons Ajax slaughters the herd of sheep intended as provisions for the army In his mad rage he mistakes these gentle creatures for the warriors on whom he means to vent his rage The slaughtered animals belong to a species traditionally utilized by the Greeks for sacrificial purposes but because the massacre takes place outside the ritual framework Ajax is taken for a madman The myth is not strictly speaking about the sacrificial process but it is certainly not irrelevant to it The institution of sacrifice is based on effects analogous to those produced by Ajaxs angerbut structured channeled and held in check by fixed laws In the ritualistic societies most familiar to usthose of the Jews and of the Greeks of the classical agethe sacrificial victims are almost always animals However there are other societies in which human victims are substituted for the individuals who are threatened by violence Even in fifth century Greecethe Athens of the great tragedians human sacrifice had not it seems completely disappeared The practice was perpetuated in the form of the pharmakos maintained by the city at its own expense and slaughtered at the appointed festivals as well as at a moment of civic disaster If examined closely for traces of human sacrifice Greek tragedy offers some remarkable revelations It is clear for example that the story of Medea parallels that of Ajax on the sacrificial level although here we are dealing with human rather than with animal sacrifice In Euripides Medea the principle of human substitution of one victim for another appears in its most savage form Frightened by the intensity of Medeas rage against her faithless husband Jason the nurse begs the childrens tutor to keep his charges out of their mothers way I am sure her anger will not subside until it has found a victim Let us pray that the victim is at least one of our enemies7 Because the object of her hatred is out of reach Medea substitutes her own children It is difficult for us to see anything resembling a religious act in Medeas insane behavior Nonetheless infanticide has its 7 Here and throughout the book quotations from the Greek plays have been translated by Patrick Gregory from the original Greek 10 Violence and the Sacred place among ritualistic practices the practice is too well documented in too many cultures including the Jewish and the ancient Greek for us to exclude it from consideration here Medeas crime is to ritual infanticide what the massacre of sheep in the Ajax is to animal sacrifice Medea prepares for the death of her children like a priest preparing for a sacrifice Before the fateful act she issues the traditional ritual announcement all those whose presence might in any way hinder the effectiveness of the ceremony are requested to remove themselves from the premises Medea like Ajax reminds us of a fundamental truth about violence if left unappeased violence will accumulate until it overflows its confines and floods the surrounding area The role of sacrifice is to stem this rising tide of indiscriminate substitutions and redirect violence into proper channels Ajax has details that underline the close relationship between the sacrificial substitution of animals and of humans Before he sets upon the flock of sheep Ajax momentarily contemplates the sacrifice of his own son The boys mother does not take this threat lightly she whisks the child away In a general study of sacrifice there is little reason to differentiate between human and animal victims When the principle of the substitution is physical resemblance between the vicarious victim and its prototypes the mere fact that both victims are human beings seems to suffice Thus it is hardly surprising that in some societies whole categories of human beings are systematically reserved for sacrificial purposes in order to protect other categories 1 do not mean to minimize the gap that exists between the societies that practice human sacrifice and those that do not However this gap should not prevent us from perceiving what they have in common Strictly speaking there is no essential difference between animal sacrifice and human sacrifice and in many cases one is substituted for the other Our tendency to insist on differences that have little reality when discussing the institution of sacrificeour reluctance for example to equate animal with human sacrificeis undoubtedly a factor in the extraordinary misunderstandings that still persist in that area of human culture This reluctance to consider all forms of sacrifice as a single phenomenon is nothing new Joseph de Maistre having defined the principle of sacrificial substitution makes the bold and wholly unsubstantiated assertion that this principle does not apply to human sacrifice One cannot he insists kill a man to save a man Yet this assertion is repeatedly contradicted by Greek tragedy implicitly in a play like Medea and explicitly elsewhere in Euripides Sacrifice 11 In Euripides Electra Qvtemnestra explains that the sacrifice of her daughter Iphigenia would have been justified if it had been performed to save human lives The tragedian thus enlightens us by way of Qytemnestra on the normal function of human sacrificethe function de Maistre had refused to acknowledge If says Qytemnestra Agamemnon had permitted his daughter to die    in order to prevent the sack of the city to help his home to rescue his children sacrificing one to save the others I could then have pardoned him But for the sake of brazen Helen     Without ever expressly excluding the subject of human sacrifice from their researchand indeed on what grounds could they do so modern scholars notably Hubert and Mauss mention it but rarely in their theoretical discussions On the other hand the scholars who do concern themselves with human sacrifice tend to concentrate on it to the exclusion of everything else dwelling at length on the sadistic or barbarous aspects of the custom Here again one particular form of sacrifice is isolated from the subject as a whole This dividing of sacrifice into two categories human and animal has itself a sacrificial character in a strictly ritualistic sense The division is based in effect on a value judgement on the preconception that one category of victimthe human beingis quite unsuitable for sacrificial purposes while another categorythe animalis eminently sacrificeable We encounter here a survival of the sacrificial mode of thinking that perpetuates a misunderstanding about the institution as a whole It is not a question of rejecting the value judgment on which this misunderstanding is based but of putting it so to speak in parentheses of recognizing that as far as the institution is concerned such judgments are purely arbitrary All reduction into categories whether implicit or explicit must be avoided all victims animal or human must be treated in the same fashion if we wish to apprehend the criteria by which victims are selected if indeed such criteria exist and discover if such a thing is possible a universal principle for their selection We have remarked that all victims even the animal ones bear a certain resemblance to the object they replace otherwise the violent impulse would remain unsatisfied But this resemblance must not be carried to the extreme of complete assimilation or it would lead to disastrous confusion In the case of animal victims the difference is always clear and no such confusion is possible Although they do their best to empathize with their cattle the Nuers never quite manage to mistake a man for a cowthe proof being that they always sacrifice the latter never the former I am not lapsing into the trap of Levy 12 Violence and the Sacred Bruhls primitive mentality I am not saying that primitive man is less capable of making distinctions than we moderns In order for a species or category of living creature human or animal to appear suitable for sacrifice it must bear a sharp resemblance to the human categories excluded from the ranks of the sacrificeable while still maintaining a degree of difference that forbids all possible confusion As I have said no mistake is possible in the case of animal sacrifice But it is quite another case with human victims If we look at the extremely wide spectrum of human victims sacrificed by various societies the list seems heterogeneous to say the least It includes prisoners of war slaves small children unmarried adolescents and the handicapped it ranges from the very dregs of society such as the Greek pharmakos to the king himself Is it possible to detect a unifying factor in this disparate group We notice at first glance beings who are either outside or on the fringes of society prisoners of war slaves pharmakos In many primitive societies children who have not vet undergone the rites of initiation have no proper place in the community their rights and duties are almost nonexistent What we are dealing with therefore are exterior or marginal individuals incapable of establishing or sharing the social bonds that link the rest of the inhabitants Their status as foreigners or enemies their servile condition or simply their age prevents these future victims from fully integrating themselves into the community But what about the king Is he not at the very heart of the community Undoubtedlybut it is precisely his position at the center that serves to isolate him from his fellow men to render him casteless He escapes from society so to speak via the roof just as the pharmakos escapes through the cellar The king has a son of foil however in the person of his fool The fool shares his masters status as an outsideran isolation whose literal truth is often of greater significance than the easily reversible symbolic values often attributed to it From every point of view the fool is eminently sacrificeable and the king can use him to vent his own anger But it sometimes happens that the king himself is sacrificed and that among certain African societies in a thoroughly regulated and highly ritualistic manner8 It is clearly legitimate to define the difference between sacrificeable and nonsacrificeable individuals in terms of their degree of integration but such a definition is not yet sufficient In many cultures women are not considered fullfledged members of their society yet women are never or rarely selected as sacrificial victims There may be a simple explanation for this fact The married woman retains her ties with her  Cf Chapter 4 pp 10410 Sacrifice 13 parents clan even after she has become in some respects the property of her husband and his family To kill her would be to run the risk of one of the two groups interpreting her sacrifice as an act of murder committing it to a reciprocal act of revenge The notion of vengeance casts a new light on the matter All our sacrificial victims whether chosen from one of the human categories enumerated above or a fortiori from the animal realm are invariably distinguishable from the nonsacrificeable beings by one essential characteristic between these victims and the community a crucial social link is missing so they can be exposed to violence without fear of reprisal Their death does not automatically entail an act of vengeance The considerable importance this freedom from reprisal has for the sacrificial process makes us understand that sacrifice is primarily an act of violence without risk of vengeance We also understand the paradox not without its comic aspects on occasionof the frequent references to vengeance in the course of sacrificial rites the veritable obsession with vengeance when no chance of vengeance exists For the act they were about to commit elaborate excuses were offered they shuddered at the prospect of the sheeps death they wept over it as though they were its parents Before the blow was struck they implored the beasts forgiveness They then addressed themselves to the species to which the beast belonged as if addressing a large family clan beseeching it not to seek vengeance for the act that was about to be inflicted on one of its members In the same vein the actual murderer was punished in some manner either beaten or sent into exile9 It is the entire species considered as a large family clan that the sacrificers beseech not to seek vengeance By incorporating the element of reprisal into the ceremony the participants are hinting broadly at the true function of the rite the kind of action it was designed to circumvent and the criteria that determined the choice of victim The desire to commit an act of violence on those near us cannot be suppressed without a conflict we must divert that impulse therefore toward the sacrificial victim the creature we can strike down without fear of reprisal since he lacks a champion Like everything that touches on the essential nature of the sacrificial act the true distinction between the sacrificeable and the nonsacrificeable is never clearly articulated Oddities and inexplicable anomalies confuse the picture For instance some animal species will be formally excluded from sacrifice but the exclusion of members of the community is never mentioned In constantly drawing attention to the truly maniacal aspects of sacrifice modern theorists only serve to per9 Hubert and Mauss Sacrifice p 33 14 Violence and the Sacred petuate an old misunderstanding in new terms Men can dispose of their violence more efficiently if they regard the process not as something emanating from within themselves but as a necessity imposed from without a divine decree whose least infraction calls down terrible punishment When they banish sacrificial practices from the real everyday world modern theorists continue to misrepresent the violence of sacrifice The function of sacrifice is to quell violence within the community and to prevent conflicts from erupting Yet societies like our own which do not strictly speaking practice sacrificial rites seem to get along without them Violence undoubtedly exists within our society but not to such an extent that the society itself is threatened with extinction The simple fact that sacrificial practices and other rites as well can disappear without catastrophic results should in part explain the failure of ethnology and theology to come to grips with these cultural phenomena and explain as well our modern reluctance to attribute a real function to them After all it is hard to maintain that institutions for which as it seems we have no need are actually indispensable It may be that a basic difference exists between a society like ours and societies imbued with religiona difference that is partially hidden from us by rites particularly by rites of sacrifice that play a compensatory role This difference would help explain why the actual function of sacrifice still eludes us When internal strife previously sublimated by means of sacrificial practices rises to the surface it manifests itself in interfamily vendettas or blood feuds This kind of violence is virtually nonexistent in our own culture And perhaps it is here that we should look for the fundamental difference between primitive societies and our own we should examine the specific ailments to which we are immune and which sacrifice manages to control if not to eliminate Why does the spirit of revenge wherever it breaks out constitute such an intolerable menace Perhaps because the only satisfactory revenge for spilt blood is spilling the blood of the killer and in the blood feud there is no clear distinction between the act for which the killer is being punished and the punishment istelf Vengeance professes to be an act of reprisal and every reprisal calls for another reprisal The crime to which the act of vengeance addresses itself is almost never an unprecedented offense in almost every case it has been committed in revenge for some prior crime Vengeance then is an interminable infinitely repetitive process Every time it turns up in some part of the community it threatens to Sacrifice IS involve the whole social body There is the risk that the act of vengeance will initiate a chain reaction whose consequences will quickly prove fatal to any society of modest size The multiplication of reprisals instantaneously puts the very existence of a society in jeopardy and that is why it is universally proscribed Curiously enough it is in the very communities where the proscription is most strictly enforced that vengeance seems to hold sway Even when it remains in the background its role in the community unacknowledged the specter of vengeance plays an important role in shaping the relationships among individuals That is not to say that the prohibition against acts of vengeance is taken lightly Precisely because murder inspires horror and because men must be forcibly restrained from murder vengeance is inflicted on all those who commit it The obligation never to shed blood cannot be distinguished from the obligation to exact vengeance on those who shed it If men wish to prevent an interminable outbreak of vengeance just as today we wish to prevent nuclear war it is not enough to convince their fellows that violence is detestablefor it is precisely because they detest violence that men make a duty of vengeance In a world still haunted by the specter of vengeance it is difficult to theorize about vengeance without resorting to equivocations or paradoxes In Greek tragedy for instance there is notand cannot be any consistent stand on the subject To attempt to extract a coherent theory of vengeance from the drama is to miss the essence of tragedy For in tragedy each character passionately embraces or rejects vengeance depending on the position he occupies at any given moment in the scheme of the drama Vengeance is a vicious circle whose effect on primitive societies can only be surmised For us the circle has been broken We owe our good fortune to one of our social institutions above all our judicial system which serves to deflect the menace of vengeance The system does not suppress vengeance rather it effectively limits it to a single act of reprisal enacted by a sovereign authority specializing in this particular function The decisions of the judiciary are invariably presented as the final word on vengeance Vocabulary is perhaps more revealing here than judicial theories Once the concept of interminable revenge has been formally rejected it is referred to as private vengeance The term implies the existence of a public vengeance a counterpart never made explicit By definition primitive societies have only private vengeance Thus public vengeance is the exclusive property of wellpoliced societies and our society calls it the judicial system  6 Violence and the Sacred Our penal system operates according to principles of justice that are in no real conflict with the concept of revenge The same principle is at work in all systems of violent retribution Either the principle is just and justice is therefore inherent in the idea of vengeance or there is no justice to be found anywhere He who exacts his own vengeance is said to take the law into his own hands There is no difference of principle between private and public vengeance but on the social level the difference is enormous Under the pyblic system an act of vengeance is no longer avenged the process is terminated the danger of escalation averted The absence of a judicial system in primitive societies has been confirmed by ethnologists Malinowski concludes that the criminal aspect of law in savage communities is perhaps even vaguer than the civil one the idea of justice in our sense is hardly applicable and the means of restoring a disturbed tribal equilibrium are slow and cumbersome10 RadcliffeBrowns conclusions are identical and summon up as such conclusions must the specter of perpetual vengeance Thus though the Andaman Islanders had a welldeveloped social conscience that is a system of moral notions as to what is right and wrong there was no such thing as punishment of a crime by the society If one person injured another it was left to the injured one to seek vengeance if he wished and if he dared There were probably always some who would side with the criminal their attachment to him overcoming their disapproval of his actions11 The anthropologist Robert Lowie speaks of the administering of justice in reference to primitive societies He distinguishes two types of societies those that possess a central authority and those that do not Among the latter it is the parental group he declares that exercises the judicial power and this group confronts the other group in the same way that a sovereign state confronts the outside world There can be no true administering of justice no judicial system without a superior tribunal capable of arbitrating between even the most powerful groups Only that superior tribunal can remove the possibility of blood feud or perpetual vendetta Lowie himself recognizes that this condition is not always met From the supreme law of group solidarity it follows that when an individual has injured a member of another group his own group shield him while the opposing group support the injured mans claims for compensation or revenge Thence there may develop bloodfeuds and civil wars    The Chukchi generally make 10 Bronislaw Malinowski Crime and Custom in Savage Society Totowa NJ 1967 p 94 u A R RadcliffeBrown The Andaman Islanders New York 1964 p 52 Sacrifice 11 peace after the first act of retribution but among the Ifugao the struggle may go on almost interminably 12 To speak here of the administering of justice is to abuse the meaning of the words The desire to find in primitive societies virtues equal or superior to our own as regards the control of violence must not lead us to minimize the differences Lowies terminology simply perpetuates a widely accepted way of thinking by which the right to vengeance takes the place of a judicial system wherever such a system is lacking This theory which seems securely anchored to common sense is in fact erroneous and gives rise to an infinite number of errors Such thinking reflects the ignorance of a societyour ownthat has been the beneficiary of a judicial system for so many years that it is no longer conscious of the systems real achievements If vengeance is an unending process it can hardly be invoked to restrain the violent impulses of society In fact it is vengeance itself that must be restrained Lowie bears witness to the truth of this proposition every time he gives an example of the administering of justice even in those societies that according to him possess a central authority It is not the lack of any abstract principle of justice that is important but the fact that the socalled legal reprisals are always in the hands of the victims themselves and those near to them As long as there exists no sovereign and independent body capable of taking the place of the injured party and taking upon itself the responsibility for revenge the danger of interminable escalation remains Efforts to modify the punishment or to hold vengeance in check can only result in a situation that is precarious at best Such efforts ultimately require a spirit of conciliation that may indeed be present but may equally well be lacking As I have said it is inexact to speak of the administering of justice even in connection with such institutional concepts as an eye for an eye or the various forms of trial by combat In such cases it seems wise to adhere to iMalinowskis conclusion The means of restoring a disturbed tribal equilibrium are slow and cumbersome    We have not found any arrangement or usage which could be classed as a form of administration of justice according to a code and by fixed methods13 If primitive societies have no tried and true remedies for dealing with an outbreak of violence no certain cure once the social equilibrium has been upset we can assume that preventive measures will play an essential role Here again I return to the concept of sacrifice as I earlier defined it an instrument of prevention in the struggle against violence 12 Robert Lowie Primitive Society New York 1970 p 400 13 Malinowski Crime and Custom in Savage Society pp 94 98 18 Violence and the Sacred In a universe where the slightest dispute can lead to disasterjust as a slight cut can prove fatal to a hemophiliacthe rites of sacrifice serve to polarize the communitys aggressive impulses and redirect them toward victims that may be actual or figurative animate or inanimate but that are always incapable of propagating further vengeance The sacrificial process furnishes an outlet for those violent impulses that cannot be mastered by selfrestraint a partial outlet to be sure but always renewable and one whose efficacy has been attested by an impressive number of reliable witnesses The sacrificial process prevents the spread of violence by keeping vengeance in check In societies that practice sacrifice there is no critical situation to which the rites are not applicable but there are certain crises that seem to be particularly amenable to sacrificial mediation In these crises the social fabric of the community is threatened dissension and discord are rife The more critical the situation the more precious the sacrificial victim must be It is significant that sacrifice has languished in societies with a firmly established judicial systemancient Greece and Rome for example In such societies the essential purpose of sacrifice has disappeared It may still be practiced for a while but in diminished and debilitated form And it is precisely under such circumstances that sacrifice usually comes to our notice and our doubts as to the real function of religious institutions are only reinforced Our original proposition stands ritual in general and sacrificial rites in particular assume essential roles in societies that lack a firm judicial system It must not be assumed however that sacrifice simply replaces a judicial system One can scarcely speak of replacing something that never existed to begin with Then too a judicial system is ultimately irreplaceable short of a unanimous and entirely voluntary renunciation of all violent actions When we minimize the dangers implicit in vengeance we risk losing sight of the true function of sacrifice Because revenge is rarely encountered in our society we seldom have occasion to consider how societies lacking a judicial system of punishment manage to hold it in check Our ignorance engages us in a false line of thought that is seldom if ever challenged Certainly we have no need of religion to help us solve a problem runaway vengeance whose very existence eludes us And because we have no need for it religion itself appears senseless The efficiency of our judicial solution conceals the problem and the elimination of the problem conceals from us the role played by religion The air of mystery that primitive societies acquire for us is undoubtedly due in large part to this misunderstanding It is undoubtedly Sacrifice 19 responsible for our extreme views of these societies our insistence on portraying them alternately as vastly superior or flagrantly inferior to our own One factor alone might well be responsible for our oscillation between extremes our radical evaluations the absence in such societies of a judicial system No one can assess with certainty the amount of violence present in another individual much less in another society We can be sure however that in a society lacking a judicial system the violence will not appear in the same places or take the same forms as in our own We generally limit our area of inquiry to the most conspicuous and accessible aspects of these societies Thus it is not unnatural that they should seem to us either horribly barbarous or blissfully Utopian In primitive societies the risk of unleashed violence is so great and the cure so problematic that the emphasis naturally falls on prevention The preventive measures naturally fall within the domain of religion where they can on occasion assume a violent character Violence and the sacred are inseparable But the covert appropriation by sacrifice of certain properties of violenceparticularly the ability of violence to move from one object to anotheris hidden from sight by the awesome machinery of ritual Primitive societies are not given over to violence Nor are they necessarily less violent or less hypocritical than our own society Of course to be truly comprehensive we ought to take into consideration all forms of violence more or less ritualized that divert a menace from nearby objects to more distant objects We ought for instance to consider war War is clearly not restricted to one particular type of society Yet the multiplication of new weapons and techniques does not constitute a fundamental difference between primitive and modern warfare On the other hand if we compare societies that adhere to a judicial system with societies that practise sacrificial rites the difference between the two is such that we can indeed consider the absence or presence of these institutions as a basis for distinguishing primitive societies from civilized11 ones These are the institutions we must scrutinize in order to arrive not at some sort of value judgement but at an objective knowledge of the respective societies to which they belong In primitive societies the exercise of preventive measures is not confined exclusively to the domain of religion The way in which these measures are made manifest in normal social intercourse made a lasting impression on the minds and imaginations of the first European observers and established a prototype of primitive psychology and behavior which if not universally applicable is still not wholly illusory 20 Violence and the Sacred When the least false step can have dire consequences human relationships may well be marked by a prudence that seems to us excessive and accompanied by precautions that appear incomprehensible It is in this sense that we must understand the lengthy palavers that precede any undertaking not sanctified by custom in this sense that we must understand primitive mans reluctance to engage in nonritualized games or contests In a society where every action or gesture may have irreparable consequences it is not surprising that the members should display a noble gravity of bearing beside which our own demeanor appears ridiculous The commercial administrative or ideological concerns that make such overwhelming demands on our time and attention seem utterly frivolous in comparison to primitive mans primary concerns Primitive societies do not have built into their structure an automatic brake against violence but we do in the form of powerful institutions whose grip grows progressively tighter as their role grows progressively less apparent The constant presence of a restraining force allows modern man safely to transgress the limits imposed on primitive peoples without even being aware of the fact In policed societies the relationships between individuals including total strangers is characterized by an extraordinary air of informality flexibility and even audacity Religion invariably strives to subdue violence to keep it from running wild Paradoxically the religious and moral authorities in a community attempt to instill nonviolence as an active force into daily life and as a mediating force into ritual life through the application of violence Sacrificial rites serve to connect the moral and religious aspects of daily life but only by means of a lengthy and hazardous detour Moreover it must be kept in mind that the efficacy of the rites depends on their being performed in the spirit of pietas which marks all aspects of religious life We are beginning to understand why the sacrificial act appears as both sinful and saintly an illegal as well as a legitimate exercise of violence However we are still far from a full understanding of the act itself Primitive religion tames trains arms and directs violent impulses as a defensive force against those forms of violence that society regards as inadmissible It postulates a strange mixture of violence and nonviolence The same can perhaps be said of our own judicial system of control There may be a certain connection between all the various methods employed by man since the beginning of time to avoid being caught up in an interminable round of revenge They can be grouped into three general categories 1 preventive measures in which sacrificial rites Sacrifice 21 divert the spirit of revenge into other channels 2 the harnessing or hobbling of vengeance by means of compensatory measures trials by combat etc whose curative effects remain precarious 3 the establishment of a judicial systemthe most efficient of all curative procedures We have listed the methods in ascending order of effectiveness The evolution from preventive to curative procedures is reflected in the course of history or at any rate in the course of the history of the Western world The initial curative procedures mark an intermediary stage between a purely religious orientation and the recognition of a judicial systems superior efficiency These methods are inherently ritualistic in character and are often associated with sacrificial practices The curative procedures employed by primitive societies appear rudimentary to us We tend to regard them as fumbling efforts to improvise a judicial system Certainly their pragmatic aspects are clearly visible oriented as they are not toward the guilty parties but toward the victimssince it is the latter who pose the most immediate threat The injured parties must be accorded a careful measure of satisfaction just enough to appease their own desire for revenge but not so much as to awaken the desire elsewhere It is not a question of codifying good and evil or of inspiring respect for some abstract concept of justice rather it is a question of securing the safety of the group by checking the impulse for revenge The preferred method involves a reconciliation between parties based on some sort of mutual compensation If reconciliation is impossible however an armed encounter can be arranged in such a manner that the violence is wholly selfcontained This encounter can take place within an enclosed space and can involve prescribed regulations and specifically designated combatants Its purpose is to cut violence short To be sure all these curative measures are steps in the direction of a legal system But the evolution if indeed evolution is the proper term is not continuous The break comes at the moment when the intervention of an independent legal authority becomes constraining Only then are men freed from the terrible obligations of vengeance Retribution in its judicial guise loses its terrible urgency Its meaning remains the same but this meaning becomes increasingly indistinct or even fades from view In fact the system functions best when everyone concerned is least aware that it involves retribution The svstem canand as soon as it can it willreorganize itself around the accused and the concept of guilt In fact retribution still holds sway but forged into a principle of abstract justice that all men arc obliged to uphold and respect 22 Violence and the Sacred We have seen that the curative measures ostensibly designed to temper the impulse toward vengeance become increasingly mysterious in their workings as they progress in efficiency As the focal point of the system shifts away from religion and the preventive approach is translated into judicial retribution the aura of misunderstanding that has always formed a protective veil around the institution of sacrifice shifts as well and becomes associated in turn with the machinery of the law As soon as the judicial system gains supremacy its machinery disappears from sight Like sacrifice it concealseven as it also revealsits resemblance to vengeance differing only in that it is not selfperpetuating and its decisions discourage reprisals In the case of sacrifice the designated victim does not become the object of vengeance because he is a replacement is not the right victim In the judicial system the violence does indeed fall on the right victim but it falls with such force such resounding authority that no retort is possible It can be argued that the function of the judicial system is not really concealed and we can hardly be unaware that the judicial process is more concerned with the general security of the community than with any abstract notion of justice Nonetheless we believe that the system is founded on a unique principle of justice unknown to primitive societies The scholarly literature on the subject seems to bear out this belief It has long been assumed that a decisive difference between primitive and civilized man is the formers general inability to identify the guilty party and to adhere to the principle of guilt Such an assumption only confuses the issue If primitive man insists on averting his attention from the wrongdoer with an obstinacy that strikes us as either idiotic or perverse it is because he wishes above all to avoid fueling the fires of vengeance If our own system seems more rational it is because it conforms more strictly to the principle of vengeance Its insistence on the punishment of the guilty party underlines this fact Instead of following the example of religion and attempting to forestall acts of revenge to mitigate or sabotage its effects or to redirect them to secondary objects our judicial system rationalizes revenge and succeeds in limiting and isolating its effects in accordance with social demands The system treats the disease without fear of contagion and provides a highly effective technique for the cure and as a secondary effect the prevention of violence This rationalistic approach to vengeance might seem to stem from a peculiarly intimate relationship between the community and the judicial system In fact it is the result not of any familiar interchange between the two but of the recognition of the sovereignty and indeSacrifice 25 pendence of the judiciary whose decisions no group not even the collectivity as a body can challenge At least that is the principle The judicial authority is beholden to no one It is thus at the disposal of everyone and it is universally respected The judicial system never hesitates to confront violence head on because it possesses a monopoly on the means of revenge Thanks to this monopoly the system generally succeeds in stifling the impulse to vengeance rather than spreading or aggravating it as a similar intervention on the part of the aggrieved party would invariably do In the final analysis then the judicial system and the institution of sacrifice share the same function but the judicial system is infinitely more effective However it can only exist in conjunction with a firmly established political power And like all modern technological advances it is a twoedged sword which can be used to oppress as well as to liberate Certainly that is the way it is seen by primitive cultures whose view on the matter is indubitably more objective than our own If the function of the system has now become apparent that is because it no longer enjoys the obscurity it needs to operate effectively A clear view of the inner workings indicates a crisis in the system it is a sign of disintegration No matter how sturdy it may seem the apparatus that serves to hide the true nature of legal and illegal violence from view eventually wears thin The underlying truth breaks through and we find ourselves face to face with the specter of reciprocal reprisal This is not a purely theoretical concept belonging to the intellectual and scholarly realm but a sinister reality a vicious circle we thought we had escaped but one we find has tightened itself all unsuspected around us The procedures that keep mens violence in bounds have one thing in common they are no strangers to the ways of violence There is reason to believe that they are all rooted in religion As we have seen the various forms of prevention go hand in hand with religious practices The curative procedures are also imbued with religious concepts both the rudimentary sacrificial rites and the more advanced judicial forms Religion in its broadest sense then must be another term for that obscurity that surrounds mans efforts to defend himself by curative or preventative means against his own violence It is that enigmatic quality that pervades the judicial system when that system replaces sacrifice This obscurity coincides with the transcendental effectiveness of a violence that is holy legal and legitimate successfully opposed to a violence that is unjust illegal and illegitimate In the same way that sacrificial victims must in principle meet the approval of the divinity before being offered as a sacrifice the judicial system appeals to a theology as a guarantee of justice Even when this 24 Violence and the Sacred theology disappears as has happened in our culture the transcendental quality of the system remains intact Centuries can pass before men realize that there is no real difference between their principle of justice and the concept of revenge Only the transcendental quality of the system acknowledged by all can assure the prevention or cure of violence This is the case no matter what the consecrating institution may be Only by opting for a sanctified legitimate form of violence and preventing it from becoming an object of disputes and recriminations can the system save itself from the vicious circle of revenge A unique generative force exists that we can only qualify as religious in a sense deeper than the theological one It remains concealed and draws its strength from this concealment even as its selfcreated shelter begins to crumble The acknowledgment of such a force allows us to assess our modern ignoranceignorance in regard to violence as well as religion Religion shelters us from violence just as violence seeks shelter in religion If we fail to understand certain religious practices it is not because we are outside their sphere of influence but because we are still to a very real extent enclosed within them The solemn debates on the death of God and of man are perhaps beside the point They remain theological at bottom and by extension sacrificial that is they draw a veil over the subject of vengeance which threatens to become quite real once again in the form not of a philosophical debate but of unlimited violence in a world with no absolute values As soon as the essential quality of transcendencereligious humanistic or whateveris lost there are no longer any terms by which to define the legitimate form of violence and to recognize it among the multitude of illicit forms The definition of legitimate and illegitimate forms then becomes a matter of mere opinion with each man free to reach his own decision In other words the question is thrown to the winds Henceforth there are as many legitimate forms of violence as there are men to implement them legitimacy as a principle no longer exists Only the introduction of some transcendental quality that will persuade men of the fundamental difference between sacrifice and revenge between a judicial system and vengeance can succeed in bypassing violence All this explains why our penetration and demystification of the system necessarily coincides with the disintegration of that system The act of demystification retains a sacrificial quality and remains essentially religious in character for at least as long as it fails to come to a conclusionas long that is as the process purports to be nonviolent or less violent than the system itself In fact demystification leads to constantly increasing violence a violence perhaps less hypocritical Sacrifice 25 than the violence it seeks to expose but more energetic more virulent and the harbinger of something far worsea violence that knows no bounds While acknowledging the differences both functional and mythical between vengeance sacrifice and legal punishment it is important to recognize their fundamental identity Precisely because these three institutions are essentially the same they tend to adopt the same types of violent response in times of crisis Seen in the abstract such an assertion may seem hyperbolic or simply unbelievable It can only be appreciated by means of concrete examples Only then will the utility of the comparison become apparent customs and institutions that have remained incomprehensible unclassifiable and aberrant heretofore make sense when seen in the light of this identity Robert Lowie discussing collective reactions to an act of violence brings out a fact well worth noting here The Chukchi generally make peace after the first act of retribution    While the Ifugao tend to protect a kinsman under almost all circumstances the Chukchi often avert a feud by killing a member of the family14 Whether it be through sacrificial killing or legal punishment the problem is to forestall a series of reprisals As the above quotation shows Lowie is well aware of this aspect In killing one of their own the Chukchi abort the issue by offering a victim to their potential enemies they enjoin them not to seek vengeance not to commit an act that would constitute a fresh affront and oblige the other side to seek further retribution This expiatory procedure brings to mind the sacrificial process the fact that the victim is someone other than the guilty party drives the resemblance home The Chukchi practice cannot however be classified as sacrificial A properly conducted ritual killing is never openly linked to another bloodletting of irregular character It never allows itself to pass as a deliberate act of retribution Because this link is consistently missing the meaning of the sacrificial process has always eluded us and the relationship between sacrifice and violence has remained obscure Now the meaning is made clear and in a manner too spectacular for the act to be mistaken for mere ritual Should one then classify this custom among legal punishments Can one properly refer to it as an execution of justice Probably not after all the victim of the second murder was in no way responsible for the first To be sure Lowie invokes the concept of collective responsibility but this is not a satisfactory explanation Collective responsibility never specifically excludes the true culprit and that is 14 Lowie Primitive Society p 400 26 Violence and the Sacred precisely what is being done here Even if this exclusion is not clearly spelled out there is sufficient evidence for us to assume that in many instances the true culprit is systematically spared As a cultural attitude this certainly demands attention To refer in this context to the socalled primitive mentality to some possible confusion between the individual and the group is to hedge the issue If the Chukchi choose to spare the culprit it is not because they cannot distinguish where the guilt lies On the contrary they perceive it with the utmost clarity It is precisely because they see that the guilty party is guilty that they choose to spare him The Chukchi believe that they have good reasons to act as they do and it is these reasons we must now examine To make a victim out of the guilty party is to play vengeances role to submit to the demands of violence By killing not the murderer himself but someone close to him an act of perfect reciprocity is avoided and the necessity for revenge bypassed If the counterviolence were inflicted on the aggressor himself it would by this very act participate in and become indistinguishable from the original act of violence In short it would become an act of pure vengeance requiring yet another act of vengeance and transforming itself into the very thing it was designed to prevent Only violence can put an end to violence and that is why violence is selfpropagating Everyone wants to strike the last blow and reprisal can thus follow reprisal without any true conclusion ever being reached In excluding the actual guilty party from reprisals the Chukchi hope to avoid the vicious cycle of revenge They try to cover their tracks but not entirely for they do not want to deprive their act of its primordial meaning as a response to an initial killing as the payment of a debt contracted by one of their number To quell the passions aroused by this crime an act is required that bears some resemblance to the vengeance sought by the plaintiffs but that does not quite qualify as an act of revenge The act resembles both a legal punishment and a sacrifice and yet it cannot be assimilated to either The act described here resembles a legal punishment in that it constitutes an act of reparation a violent retribution and the Chukchi show no hesitation in imposing on themselves the same loss they have inflicted on others Their action resembles a sacrifice in that the victim of the second murder is not responsible for the first So flagrant a disregard of the principle of guilt strikes us as absurd We hold that principle in such high esteem that any deviation from it appears to us an aberration of the intellect or malfunction of the senses Yet our line of reasoning is rejected by the primitives because it Sacrifice 21 involves too strict an application of the doctrine of vengeance and is thus fraught with peril When we require a direct link between guilt and punishment we believe that we adhere to a fundamental truth that has somehow eluded the primitive mind In fact we are ignoring a problem that poses a very real threat to all primitive societies escalating revenge unleashed violencea problem the seeming extravagances of their customs and the violence of their religious practices are specifically designed to meet In Greek culture in particular physical contact with the anathema is avoided Behind this peculiar prohibition lurks a fear perhaps analogous to the one that inspires the Chukchi custom To do violence to a violent person is to be contaminated by his violence It is best therefore to arrange matters so that nobody except perhaps the culprit himself is directly responsible for his death so that nobody is obliged to raise a finger against him He may be abandoned without provisions in midocean or stranded on top of a mountain or forced to hurl himself from a cliff The custom of exposure as a means of getting rid of malformed children seems to find its origin in this same fear All such customs may appear to us unreasonable and absurd In fact they adhere to a coherent logic All of them concern themselves with formulating and practicing a form of violence incapable of serving as a connecting link between the violent act that preceded and the one that must follow The aim is to achieve a radically new type of violence truly decisive and selfcontained a form of violence that will put an end once and for all to violence itself Primitive peoples try to break the symmetry of reprisal by addressing themselves directly to the question of form Unlike us they perceive recurrent patterns and they attempt to halt this recurrence by introducing something different into the picture Modern man has long since lost his fear of reciprocal violence which after all provides our judicial system with its structure Because the overwhelming authority of the judiciary prevents its sentence from becoming the first step in an endless series of reprisals we can no longer appreciate primitive mans deepseated fear of pure unadulterated vengeance The Chukchis behavior or the Greeks cautious treatment of the anathema strike us as puzzling Of course the Chukchi solution is not to be confused with retaliatory vengeance ritual sacrifice or legal punishment And yet it is reminiscent of all these institutions Their solution seems to occur at the point where all three intersect Unless the modern mind can cope with the fact that the three are indeed capable of intersecting it is not likely to shed much light on the questions that concern us here 28 Violence and the Sacred 4 THE CHUKCHI SOLUTION is fraught with psychological implications all of rather limited interest For example it can be said that in choosing to kill someone close to the culprit rather than the culprit himself the Chukchi are trying to be conciliatory without risking a loss of face That is indeed possible but there are many other possibilities as well It is easy to lose ones way in a maze of psychological speculation The religious structure clearly transcends all psychological1  interpretations it neither requires nor contradicts them The essential religious concern here is ritual impurity And the cause of ritual impurity is violence In many cases this fact seems selfevident Two men come to blows blood is spilt both men are thus rendered impure Their impurity is contagious and anyone who remains in their presence risks becoming a party to their quarrel The only sure way to avoid contagion is to flee the scene of violence There is no question here of duty or morality Contamination is a terrible thing and only those who are already contaminated would wilfully expose themselves to it If even an accidental contact with a contaminated being can spread the impurity it goes without saying that a violent and hostile encounter will guarantee infection Therefore the Chukchi reason whenever violence is inevitable it is best that the victim be pure untainted by any involvement in the dispute As we can see these notions of impurity and contagion play an active role in social relations and are firmly rooted in reality It is precisely this basis in reality that scholars have long denied Modern observersparticularly Frazers contemporaries and discipleswere totally blind to the reality that lay behind these ideas because it was not their reality and because primitive religion succeeded in camouflaging its social functionConcepts such as impurity and contagion because they translate human relations into material terms provide a sort of camouflage The peril that overshadows all human relations and that stems from these relations is presented either in a purely material or in a wholly otherworldly guise The notion of ritual impurity can degenerate until it is nothing more than a terrorstricken belief in the malevolent results of physical contact Violence has been transformed into a sort of seminal fluid that impregnates objects on contact and whose diffusion like electricity or Balzacian magnetism is determined by physical laws Far from dissipating the ignorance that surrounds these concepts modern thinking only reinforces the confusion By denying religion any basis in reality by viewing it as a sort of bedtime story for children we collaborate with violence in its game of deception Sacrifice 29 In many religious communitiesamong the ancient Greeks for instancewhen a man has hanged himself his body becomes impure So too does the rope from which he dangles the tree to which the rope is attached and the field where the tree stands The taint of impurity diminishes however as one draws away from the body It is as if the scene of a violent act and the objects with which the violence has been committed send out emanations that penetrate everything in the immediate area growing gradually weaker through time and space When a town has undergone a terrible bloodletting and emissaries from that town are sent to another community they are considered impure Every effort is made to avoid touching them talking to them remaining in their presence any longer than necessary After their departure rites of purification are undertaken sacrifices offered lustral water sprinkled about While Frazer and his disciples tend to view this fear of infection by the impure as a prime example of the irrational and superstitious element of religious thought other observers regard it as an anticipation of sound scientific principles They point out the striking resemblance between the precautions that modern medicine takes against bacterial infection and the ritualistic avoidance of pollution In some societies contagious diseasessmallpox for instancehave their own particular gods During his illness the patient is dedicated to the god that is he is isolated from the community and put under the supervision of an initiate or priest of the god someone who has contracted the illness and survived it This man now partakes of the gods power he is immune to the effects of the divine violence It is easy to see why some observers have concluded that these impurity rituals reveal some sort of vague intuitive knowledge of microbiology that the rituals in short are grounded in fact Against this view it is argued that the procedures that are supposed to protect the believers from ritual impurity often disregard or even flout the principles of modern hygiene This argument is not wholly satisfactory however for it fails to take into account the possible parallels between ritualistic precautions and the first tentative measures taken in the early days of public hygienein the nineteenth century for example The theory that regards religious terrors or taboos as a sort of protoscience has hit on something of real interest but too indefinite and limited to be of much use in our investigation Such a theory can only arise in a culture that regards sickness as the sole fatal influence the sole enemy man has to conquer Clearly medical considerations are not excluded from the primitive concept of contagion and the prevention of epidemics plays a definite role in impurity rites But these factors SO Violence and the Sacred play only a minor role in primitive culture They arouse our interest precisely because they offer the sole instance in which the modern scientific notion of contagion which is exclusively pathological coincides with the primitive concept which is far broader in scope The aspects of religion in which contagion seems to have some reality for us are hard to distinguish from those in which it ceases to have any reality That is not to say that primitive religion is afflicted with the sort of confusion that Frazer or LevyBruhl attributed to it The assimilation of contagious diseases and all forms of violencethe latter also regarded as contagious in natureis based on a number of complementary inferences that combine to form a strikingly coherent picture A primitive society a society that lacks a legal system is exposed to the sudden escalation of violence Such a society is compelled to adopt attitudes we may well find incomprehensible Our incomprehension seems to stem from two main factors In the first place we know absolutely nothing about the contagion of violence not even whether it actually exists In the second place the primitive people themselves recognize this violence only in an almost entirely dehumanized form that is under the deceptive guise of the sacred Considered all together the ritual precautions against violence are firmly rooted in reality absurd though some of them may appear to our own eyes If the sacrificial catharsis actually succeeds in preventing the unlimited propagation of violence a sort of infection is in fact being checked f From the outset of this study after all I have regarded violence as something eminently communicable The tendency of violence to hurl itself on a surrogate if deprived of its original object can surely be described as a contaminating process Violence too long held in check will overflow its boundsand woe to those who happen to be nearby Ritual precautions are intended both to prevent this flooding and to offer protection insofar as it is possible to those who find themselves in the path of ritual impuritythat is caught in the floodtide of violence The slightest outbreak of violence can bring about a catastrophic escalation Though we may tend to lose sight of this fact in our own daily lives we are intellectually aware of its validity and are often reminded that there is something infectious about the spectacle of violence Indeed at times it is impossible to stay immune from the infection Where violence is concerned intolerance can prove as fatal an attitude as tolerance for when it breaks out it can happen that those who oppose its progress do more to assure its triumph than those who endorse it There is no universal rule for quelling violence no principle Sacrifice 31 of guaranteed effectiveness At times all the remedies harsh as well as gentle seem efficacious at other times every measure seems to heighten the fever it is striving to abate Inevitably the moment comes when violence can only be countered by more violence Whether we fail or succeed in our effort to subdue it the real victor is always violence itself The mimetic attributes of violence are extraordinarysometimes direct and positive at other times indirect and negative The more men strive to curb their violent impulses the more these impulses seem to prosper The very weapons used to combat violence are turned against their users Violence is like a raging fire that feeds on the very objects intended to smother its flames The metaphor of fire could well give way to metaphors of tempest flood earthquake Like the plague the resemblance violence bears to these natural cataclysms is not limited to the realm of poetic imagery In acknowledging that fact however we do not mean to endorse the theory that sees in the sacred a simple transfiguration of natural phenomena The sacred consists of all those forces whose dominance over man increases or seems to increase in proportion to mans effort to master them Tempests forest fires and plagues among other phenomena may be classified as sacred Far outranking these however though in a far less obvious manner stands human violenceviolence seen as something exterior to man and henceforth as a part of all the other outside forces that threaten mankind Violence is the heart and secret soul of the sacred We have yet to learn how man succeeds in positing his own violence as an independent being Once he has accomplished this feat however the sacred presence invades his universe mysteriously infects without participating in it and buffets him about rather in the manner of a plague or other natural disaster Once all this has occurred man is confronted with a group of phenomena that despite their heterogeneous appearance exhibit remarkable similarities As a general practice it is wise to avoid contact with the sick if one wishes to stay healthy Similarly it is wise to steer clear of homicides if one is eager not to be killed As we see it these are two distinct types of contagion Modern science concerns itself exclusively with one type and has established its reality beyond all dispute However the other type could well be of greater importance to the members of a society that we have defined as primitivethat is a society lacking legal sanctions Religious thought encompasses a large body of phenomena under the heading of ritual impurityphenomena that seem disparate and absurd 32 Violence and the Sacred from the viewpoint of modern science but whose relationship and reality become perfectly clear when tested for the presence of basic violence the prime ingredient and ultimate resource of the whole system There are undeniable similarities for instance between a bout of serious illness and an act of violence wilfully perpetrated by an enemy The sufferings of the invalid are analogous to those of the wounded victim and if the invalid runs the risk of dying so too do all those who are involved in one fashion or another either actively or passively in a violent action Death is nothing more than the worst form of violence that can befall a man It is no less reasonable therefore to lump together all the possible causes of death pathological and otherwise than it is to create a separate category for only one of them sickness To understand religious thought requires an empirical approach The goal of religious thinking is exactly the same as that of technological researchnamely practical action Whenever man is truly concerned with obtaining concrete results whenever he is hard pressed by reality he abandons abstract speculation and reverts to a mode of response that becomes increasingly cautious and conservative as the forces he hopes to subdue or at least to outrun draw ever nearer In its simplest perhaps most elementary form religion manifests little curiosity about the origins of those terrible forces that visit their fury on mankind but seems to concentrate its attention on determining a regular sequential pattern that will enable man to anticipate these onslaughts and take measures against them Religious empiricism invariably leads to one conclusion it is essential to keep as far away as possible from sacred things always to avoid direct contact with them Naturally such thinking occasionally coincides with medical empiricism or with scientific empiricism in general This is why some observers insist on regarding religious empiricism as a preliminary stage of science This same empiricism however can sometimes reach conclusions so utterly foreign to our own way of thinking and can show itself so narrow inflexible and myopic in its attitudes that we are tempted to attribute its functioning to some sort of psychological malaise Such a reaction leads us to regard primitive society as an ailing society beside which our civilized society presents a picture of radiant health The adherents of this theory show no hesitation in standing these categories on their heads however whenever the need arises Thus on occasion it is civilization that is sick and because civilized society is the antithesis of primitive society it now appears that the primitive Sacrifice 33 sphere must be the healthy one Manipulate them as one will it looks as if the concepts of sickness and health are not very useful in clarifying the relationship between primitive societies and our own Ritual precautions that appear lunatic or at least highly exaggerated in a modern context are in fact quite reasonable when viewed in their proper contextthat is in the context of religions complete unawareness of the violence it makes sacred When men believe that they can actually feel the breath of a Homeric Cyclops at their backs they are apt to resort to all means at their disposal to embrace all possible precautions It seems safer to overreact than to underreact This religious attitude is not dissimilar to that of medicine when suddenly confronted with an unknown disease An epidemic breaks out the doctors and scientists are unable to isolate the pathogenic agent Under the circumstances what should they do Clearly they must adopt not some of the precautionary measures employed against familiar diseases but all of them without exception Ideally they would invent entirely new measures since the enemy they are fighting is itself employing new weapons Once the microbe has been identified it is seen that some of the measures employed were completely useless and should be abandoned in any future dealings with the disease Yet it must be admitted that as long as the cause of the illness was unknown their use was fully justified We must be careful not to push our metaphor too far Neither primitive nor modern man has yet succeeded in identifying the microbe responsible for the dread disease of violence Western civilization is hindered in its efforts to isolate and analyze the causes and to examine them in any but the most superficial manner because it has enjoyed until this day a mysterious immunity from the most virulent forms of violencean immunity not it seems of our societys making but one that has perhaps resulted in the making of our society k AMONG PRIMITIVE TABOOS the one that has perhaps been most analyzed is the taboo surrounding menstrual blood Menstrual blood is regarded as impure menstruating women are segregated from the community They are forbidden to touch any objects of communal usage sometimes even their own food for risk of contamination If we wish to understand why menstruation is considered impure we must consider it within the general category of bloodletting Most primitive peoples take the utmost care to avoid contact with blood Spilt blood of any origin unless it has been associated with a sacrificial 34 Violence and the Sacred act is considered impure This universal attribution of impurity to spilt blood springs directly from the definition we have just proposed wherever violence threatens ritual impurity is present When men are enjoying peace and security blood is a rare sight When violence is unloosed however blood appears everywhereon the ground underfoot forming great pools Its very fluidity gives form to the contagious nature of violence Its presence proclaims murder and announces new upheavals to come Blood stains everything it touches the color of violence and death Its very appearance seems as the saying goes to cry out for vengeance Any bloodletting is frightening It is only natural therefore that menstrual bleeding should awaken fear However there is another complicating element at work here Although menstrual bleeding can be readily distinguished from blood spilt in a murder or an accident and can thus be dissociated from those virulent forms of violence it is in many societies regarded as the most impure of impurities We can only assume that this extreme reaction has to do with the sexual aspect of menstruation Sexuality is one of those primary forces whose sovereignty over man is assured by man s firm belief in his sovereignty over it The most extreme forms of violence can never be directly sexual because they are collective in nature The group is quite capable of perpetrating a single coherent act of violence whose force is increased with the addition of each individual quotient of violence but sexuality is never truly collective That fact alone explains why sexual interpretations of the sacred invariably ignore or play down the role of violence whereas an interpretation based on violence readily grants sexuality the prominent place it occupies in all primitive religions We are tempted to conclude that violence is impure because of its relation to sexuality Yet only the reverse proposition can withstand close scrutiny Sexuality is impure because it has to do with violence Such an idea seems to run counter to the spirit of contemporary humanism which has settled into a friendly accord with the pansexualism of the psychoanalysts and remains unruffled even by the deathwish theory Nonetheless the signs are too numerous and too clear to be ignored We have conceded that menstrual blood has a direct relationship to sexuality we also contend that its relationship to unleashed violence is even closer The blood of a murdered man is impure This impurity cannot be derived from the impurity attributed to menstrual blood On the other hand to understand the impurity of menstrual blood we must trace its relationship to blood spilt by violence as well as to sexuality The fact that the sexual organs of women periodically Sacrifice 35 emit a flow of blood has always made a great impression on men it seems to confirm an affinity between sexuality and those diverse forms of violence that invariably lead to bloodshed To understand the nature and extent of this affinity we must return to that solid core of common sense that plays a far greater role in religious thinking than fashionable theorists are willing to acknowledge In fact the notion that the beliefs of all mankind are a grand mystification that we alone have succeeded in penetrating is a hardy perennialas well as being to say the least somewhat arrogant The problem at hand is not the arrogance of Western science nor its blatant imperialism but rather its sheer inadequacy It is precisely when the need to understand becomes most urgent that the explanations proposed in the domain of religion become most unsatisfactory The connection between sexuality and religion is a heritage common to all religions and is supported by an impressive array of convergent facts Sex and violence frequently come to grips in such direct forms as abduction rape defloration and various sadistic practices as well as in indirect actions of indefinite consequences Sex is at the origin of various illnesses real or imaginary it culminates in the bloody labors of childbirth which may entail the death of mother child or both together Even within the ritualistic framework of marriage when all the matrimonial vows and other interdictions have been conscientiously observed sexuality is accompanied by violence and as soon as one trespasses beyond the limits of matrimony to engage in illicit relationshipsincest adultery and the likethe violence and the impurity resulting from this violence grows more potent and extreme Sexuality leads to quarrels jealous rages mortal combats It is a permanent source of disorder even within the most harmonious of communities In refusing to admit an association between sexuality and violence an association readily acknowledged by men over the course of several millenniamodern thinkers are attempting to prove their broadmindedness and liberality Their stance has led to numerous misconceptions Like violence sexual desire tends to fasten upon surrogate objects if the object to which it was originally attracted remains inaccessible it willingly accepts substitutes And again like violence repressed sexual desire accumulates energy that sooner or later bursts forth causing tremendous havoc It is also worth noting that the shift from violence to sexuality and from sexuality to violence is easily effected even by the most normal of individuals totally lacking in perversion Thwarted sexuality leads naturally to violence just as lovers quarrels often end in an amorous embrace Recent scientific findings seem to justify the primitive perspective on many points Sexual excitement 36 Violence and the Sacred and violent impulses manifest themselves in the same manner In both instances the majority of discernible bodily reactions are identical15 Before we attempt to explain away the taboo on menstrual blood by means of some allinclusive generalized interpretationbefore for example we invoke those phantasms that play the same role in our consciousness as do the enchanters tricks in Don Quixoteswe should make quite sure that we have first exhausted all direct avenues to comprehension In fact there is nothing incomprehensible about the viewpoint that sees menstrual blood as a physical representation of sexual violence We ought however to go further to inquire whether this process of symbolization does not respond to some halfsuppressed desire to place the blame for all forms of violence on women By means of this taboo a transfer of violence has been effected and a monopoly established that is clearly detrimental to the female sex  Q a l  THE TAINT OF impurity cannot always be avoided even the most careful precautions are no security against it And the least contact with the infection can contaminate the entire community How can one cleanse the infected members of all trace of pollution Does there exist some miraculous substance potent enough not only to resist infection but also to purify if need be the contaminated blood Only blood itself blood whose purity has been guaranteed by the performance of appropriate ritesthe blood in short of sacrificial victimscan accomplish this feat Behind this astonishing paradox the menace of violent action can be discerned All concepts of impurity stem ultimately from the communitys fear of a perpetual cycle of violence arising in its midst The menace is always the same and provokes the same set of responses the same sacrificial gestures designed to redirect the violence onto inconsequential victims The idea of ritual purification is far more than mere shadow play or illusion The function of ritual is to purify violence that is to trick violence into spending itself on victims whose death will provoke no reprisals Because the secret of this mechanism is unknown to the participants in the rites religion tries to account for its own operation metaphorically using for that purpose the objects and materials involved in that operation The properties of blood for example vividly illustrate the entire operation of violence We have already spoken of blood spilt by mischance or malice Blood that dries on the victim soon loses its viscous quality and becomes first a dark sore then a roughened scab Blood that is allowed to congeal on its victim is the impure 15 Storr Human Aggression pp 1819 Sacrifice 57 product of violence illness or death In contrast to this contaminated substance is the fresh blood of newly slaughtered victims crimson and free flowing This blood is never allowed to congeal but is removed without trace as soon as the rites have been concluded The physical metamorphosis of spilt blood can stand for the double nature of violence Some religious practices make elaborate use of this duality Blood serves to illustrate the point that the same substance can stain or cleanse contaminate or purify drive men to fury and murder or appease their anger and restore them to life We are not dealing here with one of Gaston Bachelards material metaphors a poetic recreation of little real consequence Nor does Laura Makariuss suggestion that the ambiguous character of blood is in fact the ultimate reality behind the constant reversals of primitive religion seem wholly apposite here16 Both authors lose sight of a crucial point the paradoxical nature of violence Although religion grasps this paradoxand that only tentativelymostly by means of such symbolic representations as that of blood it differs radically from modern theory which speaks of phantasms and poetry and does not even realize how real the sacrificial process can be and how appropriate the major metaphors and symbols through which it is expressed Even the wildest aberrations of religious thought still manage to bear witness to the fact that evil and the violent measures taken to combat evil are essentially the same At times violence appears to man in its most terrifying aspect wantonly sowing chaos and destruction at other times it appears in the guise of peacemaker graciously distributing the fruits of sacrifice The secret of the dual nature of violence still eludes men Beneficial violence must be carefully distinguished from harmful violence and the former continually promoted at the expense of the latter Ritual is nothing more than the regular exercise of good violence As we have remarked if sacrificial violence is to be effective it must resemble the nonsacrificial variety as closely as possible That is why some rites may seem to us nothing more than senseless inversions of prohibited acts For instance in some societies menstrual blood is regarded as a beneficial substance when employed in certain rites but retains its baleful character in other contexts The twoinone nature of bloodthat is of violenceis strikingly illustrated in Euripides1 Ion The Athenian queen Creusa plots to do away with the hero by means of an exotic talisman two drops of blood from the deadly Gorgon One drop is a deadly poison the other 16Cf Laura Makarius Les Tabous du forgeron Diogene 62 AprilJune 1968 38 Violence and the Sacred a miraculous healing agent The queens old slave asks her the origin of this substance Creusa When the fatal blow was struck a drop spurted from the hollow vein    Slave How is it used What are its properties Creusa It wards off all sickness and nourishes life Slave And the other drop Creusa It kills It is made from the Gorgon s venomous serpents Slave Do you carry them mixed together or separate Creusa Are good and evil to be mixed together Separate of course Nothing could seem more alike than two drops of blood yet in this case nothing could be more different It is only too easy to blend them together and produce a substance that would efface all distinction between the pure and the impure Then the difference between good and bad violence would be eliminated as well As long as purity and impurity remain distinct even the worst pollution can be washed away but once they are allowed to mingle purification is no longer possible     Chapter Two The Sacrificial Crisis nYJj l A S W E HAVE SEEN the proper functioning of the    N  sacrificial process requires not only the complete separation of the sacrificed victim from those beings for whom the victim is a substitute but also a similarity between both parties This dual requirement can be fulfilled only through a delicately balanced mechanism of associations Any change however slight in the hierarchical classification of living creatures risks undermining the whole sacrificial structure The sheer repetition of the sacrificial actthe repeated slaughter of the same type of victiminevitably brings about such change But the inability to adapt to new conditions is a trait characteristic of religion in general If as is often the case we encounter the institution of sacrifice either in an advanced state of decay or reduced to relative insignificance it is because it has already undergone a good deal of wear and tear Whether the slippage in the mechanism is due to too little or too much contact between the victim and those whom the victim represents the results are the same The elimination of violence is no longer effected on the contrary conflicts within the community multiply and the menace of chain reactions looms ever larger If the gap between the victim and the community is allowed to grow too wide all similarity wrill be destroyed The victim will no longer be capable of attracting the violent impulses to itself the sacrifice will cease to serve as a good conductor in the sense that metal is a good conductor of electricity On the other hand if there is too much continuity the violence will overflow its channels Impure violence will mingle with the sacred violence of the rites turning the latter into a scandalous accomplice in the process of pollution even a kind of catalyst in the propagation of further impurity These are postulates that seem to take form a priori from our earlier conclusions They can also be discerned in literaturein the adaptations of certain myths in classical Greek tragedy in particular in Euripides version of the legend of Heracles Euripides1 Heracles contains no tragic conflict no debate between 39 40 Violence and the Sacred declared adversaries The real subject of the play is the failure of a sacrifice the act of sacrificial violence that suddenly goes wrong Heracles returning home after the completion of his labors finds his wife and children in the power of a usurper named Lycus who is preparing to offer them as sacrificial victims Heracles kills Lycus After this most recent act of violence committed in the heart of the city the heros need to purify himself is greater than ever and he sets about preparing a sacrifice of his own His wife and children are with him when Heracles suddenly seized by madness mistakes them for his enemies and sacrifices them Heracles misidentification of his family is attributed to Lyssa goddess of madness who is operating as an emissary of two other goddesses Iris and Hera who bear Heracles ill will The preparations for the sacrifice provide an imposing setting for the homicidal outburst it is unlikely that their dramatic significance passed unnoticed by the author In fact it is Euripides himself who directs our attention to the ritualistic origins of the onslaught After the massacre Heracles father Amphitryon asks his son My child what happened to you How could this horror have taken place Was it perhaps the spilt blood that turned your head Heracles who is just returning to consciousness and remembers nothing inquires in turn Where did the madness overtake me Where did it strike me down Amphitryon replies Near the altar where you were purifying your hands over the sacred flames The sacrifice contemplated by the hero succeeded only too well in polarizing the forces of violence Indeed it produced a superabundance of violence of a particularly virulent kind As Amphitryon suggested the blood shed in the course of the terrible labors and in the city itself finally turned the heros head Instead of drawing off the violence and allowing it to ebb away the rites brought a veritable flood of violence down on the victim The sacrificial rites were no longer able to accomplish their task they swelled the surging tide of impure violence instead of channeling it The mechanism of substitutions had gone astray and those whom the sacrifice was designed to protect became its victims The difference between sacrificial and nonsacrificial violence is anything but exact it is even arbitrary At times the difference threatens to disappear entirely There is no such thing as truly pure violence Nevertheless sacrificial violence can in the proper circumstances serve as an agent of purification That is why those who perform the rites are obliged to purify themselves at the conclusion of the sacrifice The procedure followed is reminiscent of atomic power plants when The Sacrificial Crisis 41 the expert has finished decontaminating the installation he must himself be decontaminated And accidents can always happen The catastrophic inversion of the sacrificial act would appear to be an essential element in the Heracles myth The motif reappears thinly concealed behind secondary themes in another episode of his story in Sophocles The Women of Trachis Heracles had mortally wounded the centaur Nessus who had assaulted Heracles wife Deianira Before dying the centaur gave the young woman a shirt smeared with his spermor in Sophocles1 version smeared with his blood mixed with the blood of a Hydra Once again as in the Ion we encounter the theme of the two kinds of blood mingling to form one The subject of the tragedy as in Euripides Heracles is the return of the hero In this instance Heracles is bringing with him a pretty young captive of whom Deianira is jealous Deianira sends a servant to her husband with a welcoming gift the shirt of Nessus With his dying breath the centaur had told her that the shirt would assure the wearers eternal fidelity to her but he cautioned her to keep it well out of the way of any flame or source of heat Heracles puts on the shirt and soon afterward lights a fire for the rites of sacrificial purification The flames activate the poison in the shirt it is the rite itself that unlooses the evil Heracles contorted with pain presently ends his life on the pyre he has begged his son to prepare Before dying Heracles kills the servant who delivered the shirt to him this death along with his own and the subsequent suicide of his wife contributes to the cycle of violence heralded by Heracles return and the failure of the sacrifice Once again violence has struck the beings who sought the protection of sacrificial rites A number of sacrifice motifs intermingle in these two plays A special sort of impurity clings to the warrior returning to his homeland still tainted with the slaughter of war In the case of Heracles his sanguinary labors render him particularly impure The returning warrior risks carrying the seed of violence into the very heart of his city The myth of Horatius as explicated by Georges Dumezil illustrates this theme Horatius kills his sister before any ritual purification has been performed In the case of Heracles the impurity triumphs over the rite itself If we examine the mechanism of violence in these two tragedies we notice that when the sacrifice goes wrong it sets off a chain reaction of the sort defined in the first chapter The murder of Lycus is presented in the Euripides play as a last labor of the hero a stillrational prelude to the insane outburst that follows Seen from the perspective of the ritualist it might well constitute a first link of impure violence 42 Violence and the Sacred With this incident as we have noted violence invades the heart of the city This initial murder corresponds to the death of the old servant in The Women of Trachis Supernatural intervention plays no part in these episodes except perhaps to cast a thin veil over the true subject the sacrificial celebration that has gone wrong The goddess Lyssa Nessus shirtthese add nothing to the meaning of the two stories rather they act as a veil and as soon as the veil is drawn aside we encounter the same theme of good violence turning into bad The mythological accompaniments of the stories can be seen as redundant Lyssa the goddess of madness sounds more like a refugee from an allegorical tale than a real goddess and Nessus shirt joins company with all the acts of violence that Heracles carries on his back The theme of the Warriors Return is not strictly speaking mythological and readily lends itself to sociological or psychological interpretations The conquering hero who threatens to destroy the liberty of his homeland belongs to history not myth Certainly that is the way Corneille seems to approach the subject in Horace although in his version of the tale the ideology is somewhat reversedthe returning warrior is rightly shocked by his sisters lack of patriotism We could easily translate the case histories of Heracles and Horatius into psychological or psychoanalytical terms and come up with numerous working theories each at variance with the other But we should avoid this temptation for in debating the relative merits of each theory we would lose sight of the role played by rituala subject that has nothing to do with such debates even though it may as we shall see open the way to them Being more primitive ritualistic action is hospitable to all ideological interpretations and dependent on none It has only one axiom the contagious nature of the violence encountered by the warrior in battleand only one prescription the proper performance of ritual purification Its sole purpose is to prevent the resurgence of violence and its spread throughout the community The two tragedies we have been discussing present in anecdotal form as if dealing exclusively with exceptional individuals events that are significant because they affect the community as a whole Sacrifice is a social act and when it goes amiss the consequences are not limited to some exceptional individual singled out by Destiny Historians seem to agree that Greek tragedy belonged to a period of transition between the dominance of an archaic theocracy and the emergence of a new modern order based on statism and laws Before its decline the archaic order must have enjoyed a certain stability and this stability must have reposed on its religious elementthat is on the sacrificial rites The Sacrificial Crisis 45 Although they predate the tragedians the preSocratics are often regarded as the philosophers of classical tragedy In their writings we can find echoes of the religious crisis we are attempting to define The fifth fragment of Heraclitus quite clearly deals with the decay of sacrificial rites with their inability to purify what is impure Religious beliefs are compromised by the decadent state of the ritual In vain do they strive for purification by besmirching themselves with blood as the man who has bathed in the mire seeks to cleanse himself with mud Such antics can only strike the beholder as utter folly In addressing their prayers to images of the gods they might just as well be speaking to the walls without seeking to know the true nature of gods or heroes The difference between blood spilt for ritual and for criminal purposes no longer holds The Heraclitus fragment appears in even sharper relief when compared to analogous passages in the Old Testament The preexilian prophets Amos Isaiah and Micah denounce in vehement terms the impotence of the sacrificial process and ritual in general In the most explicit manner they link the decay of religious practices to the deterioration of contemporary behavior Inevitably the eroding of the sacrificial system seems to result in the emergence of reciprocal violence Neighbors who had previously discharged their mutual aggressions on a third party joining together in the sacrifice of an outside victim now turn to sacrificing one another Empedocles Purifications brings us even closer to the problem 136 When will the sinister noise of this carnage cease Can you not see that you are devouring one another with your callous hearts 137 The father seizes hold of the son who has changed form in his mad delusion he kills him murmuring prayers The son cries out imploring his insane executioner to spare him But the father hears him not and cuts his throat and spreads a great feast in his palace In the same way the son takes hold of the father the children their mother one slaughtering the other and devouring their own flesh and blood The concept of a sacrificial crisis may be useful in clarifying certain aspects of Greek tragedy To a real extent it is sacrificial religion that provides the language for these dramas the criminal in the plays sees himself not so much as a righterofwrongs as a performerofsacrifices We always view the tragic flaw from the perspective of the new emergent order never from that of the old order in the final stages of decay The reason for this approach is clear modern thought has never been able to attribute any real function to the practice of sacrifice and because the nature of the practice eludes us we naturally find it difficult to determine when and if this practice is in the process 44 Violence and the Sacred of disintegration In the case of Greek tragedy it is not enough merely to believe in the existence of the old order we must look deeper if we hope to discover the religious problems of the era Unlike the Jewish prophets whose viewpoint was historical the Greek tragedians evoked their own sacrificial crisis in terms of legendary figures whose forms were fixed by tradition All the bloody events that serve as background to the playsthe plagues and pestilences civil and foreign warsundoubtedly reflect the contemporary scene but the images are unclear as if viewed through a glass darkly Each time for example a play of Euripides deals with the collapse of a royal house as in Heracles Iphigenia in Aulis or The Bacchae we are convinced that the poet is suggesting that the scene before our eyes is only the tip of the iceberg that the real issue is the fate of the entire community At the moment when Heracles is slaughtering his family offstage the chorus cries out Look look The tempest is shaking the house the roof is falling in If the tragic crisis is indeed to be described in terms of the sacrificial crisis its relationship to sacrifice should be apparent in all aspects of tragedyeither conveyed directly through explicit reference or perceived indirectly in broad outline underlying the texture of the drama If the art of tragedy is to be defined in a single phrase we might do worse than call attention to one of its most characteristic traits the opposition of symmetrical elements There is no aspect of the plot form or language of a tragedy in which this symmetrical pattern does not recur The third actor for instance hardly constitutes the innovation that critics have claimed Third actor or no third actor the core of the drama remains the tragic dialogue that is the fateful confrontation during which the two protagonists exchange insults and accusations with increasing earnestness and rapidity The Greek public brought to these verbal contests the same educated sense of appreciation that French audiences many centuries later evinced for their own classic dramafor Theramenes famous speech from the last act of Phedre for example or for almost any passage from Le Cid The symmetry of the tragic dialogue is perfectly mirrored by the stichomythia in which the two protagonists address one another in alternating lines In tragic dialogue hot words are substituted for cold steel But whether the violence is physical or verbal the suspense remains the same The adversaries match blow for blow and they seem so evenly matched that it is impossible to predict the outcome of the battle The structural similarity between the two forms of violence is illustrated by the description of the duel between the brothers Eteocles and Polyneices in Euripides Phoenicia Women There is nothing in The Sacrificial Crisis 45 this account that does not apply equally to both brothers their parries thrusts and feints their gestures and postures are identical If either saw the others eye peer over the rim of his shield He raised his spear Polyneices loses his spear in the fight and so does Eteocles Both are wounded Each blow upsets the equilibrium threatening to decide the outcome then and there It is immediately followed by a new blow that not only redresses the balance but creates a symmetrical disequilibrium that is itself naturally enough of short duration The tragic suspense follows the rhythm of these rapid exchanges each one of which promises to bring matters to a headbut never quite does so They struggle now on even terms each having spent his spear Swords are unsheathed and the two brothers are locked in close combat Shield clashes with shield and a great clamor engulfs them both Even death fails to tip the balance They hit the dust and lay together side by side and their heritage was still unclaimed The death of the brothers resolves nothing it simply perpetuates the symmetry of the battle Each had been his armys champion and the two armies now resume the struggle reestablish the symmetry Oddly enough however the conflict is now transferred to a purely verbal plane transforming itself into a true tragic dialogue Tragedy now assumes its proper function as a verbal extension of physical combat an interminable debate set off by the chronically indecisive character of an act of violence committed previously The soldiers then leapt to their feet and the argument began We claimed that our king had won they claimed the victory for Polyneices The captains quarreled too Some said that Polyneices had struck the first blow others replied that death had snatched the palm of victory from both claimants The indecisiveness of the first combat spreads quite naturally to the second which then sows it abroad The tragic dialogue is a debate without resolution Each side resolutely continues to deploy the same arguments emphases goals Gleichgewicht is Holderlins word for it Tragedy is the balancing of the scale not of justice but of violence No sooner is something added to one side of the scale than its equivalent is contributed to the other The same insults and accusations fly from one combatant to the other as a ball flies from one player to another in tennis The conflict stretches on interminably because between the two adversaries there is no difference whatsoever The equilibrium in the struggle has often been attributed to a socalled tragic impartiality Holderlins word is lmpmrtialitat I do not find this interpretation quite satisfactory Impartiality implies a delibH Violence and the Sacred erate refusal to take sides a firm commitment to treat both contestants equally The impartial party is not eager to resolve the issue does not want to know if there is a resolution nor does he maintain that resolution is impossible His impartialityatanyprice is not unfrequently simply an unsubstantiated assertion of superiority One of the adversaries is right the other wrong and the onlooker is obliged to take sides either that or the rights and wrongs are so evenly distributed between the two factions that taking sides is impossible The selfproclaimed advocate of impartiality does not want to commit himself to either course of action If pushed toward one camp he seeks refuge in the other Men always find it distasteful to admit that the reasons on both sides of a dispute are equally validwhich is to say that violence operates without reason Tragedy begins at that point where the illusion of impartiality as well as the illusions of the adversaries collapses For example in Oedipus the King Oedipus Creon and Tiresias are each in turn drawn into a conflict that each had thought to resolve in the role of impartial mediator It is not clear to what extent the tragedians themselves managed to remain impartial For example Euripides in The Phoenician Women barely conceals his preference for Eteoclesor perhaps we should say his preference for the Athenian publics approval In any case his partiality is superficial The preferences registered for one side or another never prevent the authors from constantly underlining the symmetrical relationship between the adversaries At the very moment when they appear to be abandoning impartiality the tragedians do their utmost to deprive the audience of any means of taking sides Aeschylus Sophocles and Euripides all utilize the same procedures and almost identical phraseology to convey symmetry identity reciprocity We encounter here an aspect of tragic art that has been largely overlooked by contemporary criticism Nowadays critics tend to assess a work of art on the basis of its origiidity To the extent that an author cannot claim exclusive rights to his themes his style and his esthetic effects his work is deemed deficient In the domain of esthetics singularity reigns supreme Such criteria cannot apply of course to Greek tragedy whose authors were not committed to the doctrine of originality at any price Nevertheless our frustrated individualism still exerts a deleterious effect on modern interpretations of Greek tragedy It is readily apparent that Aeschylus Sophocles and Euripides shared certain literary traits and that the characters in their plays have certain characteristics in common Yet there is no reason to label these resemblances mere stereotypes It is my belief that these stereotypes The Sacrificial Crisis 41 contain the very essence of Greek tragedy And if the tragic element in these plays still eludes us it is because we have obstinately averted our attention from these similarities The tragedians portray men and women caught up in a form of violence too impersonal in its workings too brutal in its results to allow any sort of value judgement any sort of distinction subtle or simplistic to be drawn between good1 and wicked characters That is why most modern interpretations go astray we have still not extricated ourselves entirely from the Manichean frame of reference that gained sway in the Romantic era and still exerts its influence today In Greek tragedy violence invariably effaces the differences between antagonists The sheer impossibility of asserting their differences fuels the rage of Eteocles and Polyneices In Euripides Heracles the hero kills Lycus to keep him from sacrificing his family and next he does what he wanted to prevent his enemy from doing thereby falling victim to the ironic humor of a Destiny that seems to work hand in glove with violence In the end it is Heracles who carries out the crime meditated by his counterpart The more a tragic conflict is prolonged the more likelv it is to culminate in a violent mimesis the resemblance between the combatants grows ever stronger until each presents a mirror image of the other There is a scientific corollary modern research suggests that individuals of quite different makeup and background respond to violence in essentially the same way It is the act of reprisal the repetition of imitative acts of violence that characterizes tragic plotting The destruction of differences is particularly spectacular when the hierarchichal distance between the characters the amount of respect due from one to the other is great between father and son for instance This scandalous effacement of distinctions is apparent in Euripides Alcestis Father and son are engaged in a tragic dialogue each accuses the other of fleeing from death and leaving the heroine to die The symmetry is perfect emphasized by the symmetrical interventions of the members of the Chorus who first castigate the son Young man remember to whom you are speaking do not insult your father and then rebuke the father Enough has been said on this subject cease we pray you to abuse your own son In Oedipus the King Sophocles frequently puts in Oedipuss mouth words that emphasize his resemblance to his father resemblance in desires suspicions and course of action If the hero throws himself impetuously into the investigation that causes his downfall it is because he is reacting just as Laius did in seeking out the potential assassin who according to the oracles would replace him on the throne of Thebes and in the bed of the queen 48 Violence and the Sacred Oedipus finally kills Laius but it is Laius who at the crossroads first raised his hand against his son The patricide thus takes part in a reciprocal exchange of murderous gestures It is an act of reprisal in a universe based on reprisals At the core of the Oedipus myth as Sophocles presents it is the proposition that all masculine relationships are based on reciprocal acts of violence Laius taking his cue from the oracle violently rejects Oedipus out of fear that his son will seize his throne and invade his conjugal bed Oedipus taking his cue from the oracle does away with Laius violently rebuffs the sphinx then takes their placesas king and scourge of the city respectively Again Oedipus taking his cue from the oracle plots the death of that unknown figure who may be seeking to usurp his own position Oedipus Creon and Tiresias each taking his cue from the oracle seek one anothers downfall All these acts of violence gradually wear away the differences that exist not only in the same family but throughout the community The tragic combat between Oedipus and Tiresias pits the communitys chief spiritual leaders against one another The enraged Oedipus seeks to strip the aura of mystery1 from his rival to prove that he is a false prophet nothing more Come tell us have you truly shown yourself a prophet When the terrible sphinx held sway over our countrymen did you ever whisper the words that would have delivered them That riddle was not to be answered by anyone the gift of prophecy was called for Yet that gift was clearly not yours to give nor was it ever granted to you either by the birds or by the gods Confronted by the kings frustration and rage at being unable to uncover the truth Tiresias launches his own challenge The terms are much the same If you are so clever at solving enigmas why are you powerless to solve this one Both parties in this tragic dialogue have recourse to the same tactics use the same weapons and strive for the same goal destruction of the adversary Tiresias poses as the champion of tradition taking up the cudgels on behalf of the oracles flouted by Oedipus However in so doing he shows himself insolent to royal authority Although the targets are individuals it is the institutions that receive the blows Legitimate authority trembles on its pedestal and the combatants finally assist in the downfall of the very order they strove to maintain The impiety referred to by the chorusthe neglect of the oracles the general decadence that pervades the religion of the communityare surely part of the same phenomenon that works away at the undermining of family relationships as well as of religious and social hierarchies The Sacrificial Crisis 49 The sacrificial crisis that is the disappearance of the sacrificial rites coincides with the disappearance of the difference between impure violence and purifying violence When this difference has been effaced purification is no longer possible and impure contagious reciprocal violence spreads throughout the community The sacrificial distinction the distinction between the pure and the impure cannot be obliterated without obliterating all other differences as well One and the same process of violent reciprocity engulfs the whole The sacrificial crisis can be defined therefore as a crisis of distinctionsthat is a crisis affecting the cultural order This cultural order is nothing more than a regulated system of distinctions in which the differences among individuals are used to establish their identity and their mutual relationships In the first chapter the danger threatening the community with the decay of sacrificial practices was portrayed in terms of physical violence of cyclical vengeance set off by a chain reaction We now discover more insidious forms of the same evil When the religious framework of a society starts to totter it is not exclusively or immediately the physical security of the society that is threatened rather the whole cultural foundation of the society is put in jeopardy The institutions lose their vitality the protective facade of the society gives way social values are rapidly eroded and the whole cultural structure seems on the verge of collapse The hidden violence of the sacrificial crisis eventually succeeds in destroying distinctions and this destruction in turn fuels the renewed violence In short it seems that anything that adversely affects the institution of sacrifice will ultimately pose a threat to the very basis of the community to the principles on which its social harmony and equilibrium depend     i A SINGLE PRINCIPLE is at work in primitive religion and classical tragedy alike a principle implicit but fundamental Order peace and fecundity depend on cultural distinctions it is not these distinctions but the loss of them that gives birth to fierce rivalries and sets members of the same family or social group at one anothers throats Modern society aspires to equality among men and tends instinctively to regard all differences even those unrelated to the economic or social status of men as obstacles in the path of human happiness This modern ideal exerts an obvious influence on ethnological approaches although more often on the level of technical procedure than that of explicit principle The permutations of this ideal are complex rich in potential contradictions and difficult to characterize briefly SO Violence and the Sacred Suffice it to say that an antidifferentiar prejudice often falsifies the ethnological outlook not only on the origins of discord and conflict but also on all religious modes Although usually implicit its principles are explicitly set forth in Victor Turners The Ritual Process Structural differentiation both vertical and horizontal is the foundation of strife and factionalism and of struggles in dyadic relations between incumbents of positions or rivals for positions1 When differences come unhinged they are generally identified as the cause of those rivalries for which they also furnish the stakes This has not always been their role As in the case of sacrificial rites when they no longer serve as a dam against violence they serve to swell the flood In order to rid ourselves of some fashionable intellectual attitudes useful enough in their place but not always relevant in dealing with the pastwe might turn to Shakespeare who in the course of the famous speech of Ulysses in Troilus and Cressida makes some interesting observations on the interaction of violence and differences The point of view of primitive religion and Greek tragedy could not be better summarized than by this speech The Greek army has been besieging Troy for a long time and is growing demoralized through want of action In commenting on their position Ulysses strays from the particular to a general reflection on the role of Degree or distinctions in human endeavors Degree or gradus is the underlying principle of all order natural and cultural It permits individuals to find a place for themselves in society it lends a meaning to things arranging them in proper sequence within a hierarchy it defines the objects and moral standards that men alter manipulate and transform The musical metaphor describes that order as a structure in the modern sense of the word a system of chords thrown into disharmony by the sudden intervention of reciprocal violence    O when Degree is shaked Which is the ladder to all high designs The enterprise is sick How could communities Degrees in schools and brotherhoods in cities Peaceful commerce from dividable shores The primogenitive and due of birth Prerogative of age crowns sceptres laurels But by degree stand in authentic place Take but degree away untune that string And hark what discord follows Each thing meets In mere oppugnancy the bounded waters 1 Victor Turner The Ritual Process Chicago 1969 p 179 The Sacrificial Crisis 51 Should lift their bosoms higher than the shores And make a sop of all this solid globe Strength should be lord of imbecility And the rude son should strike his father dead Force should be right or rather right and wrong Between whose endless jar justice resides Should lose their names and so should justice too xs in Greek tragedy and primitive religion it is not the differences but the loss of them that gives rise to violence and chaos that inspires Ulysses plaint This loss forces men into a perpetual confrontation one that strips them of all their distinctive characteristicsin short of their identities Language itself is put in jeopardy uEach thing meetsIn mere oppugnancy the adversaries are reduced to indefinite objects things that wantonly collide with each other like loose cargo on the decks of a stormtossed ship The metaphor of the floodtide that transforms the earths surface to a muddy mass is frequently employed by Shakespeare to designate the undifferentiated state of the world that is also portrayed in Genesis and that we have attributed to the sacrificial crisis In this situation no one and nothing is spared coherent thinking collapses and rational activities are abandoned All associative forms are dissolved or become antagonistic all values spiritual or material perish Of course formal education as represented by academic degrees is rendered useless because its value derives from the now inoperative principle of universal differentiation To say that this speech merely reflects a Renaissance commonplace the great chain of being is unsatisfactory Who has ever seen a great chain of being collapse Ulysses is a career soldier authoritarian in temper and conservative in inclination Nevertheless the order he is committed to defend is secretly acknowledged as arbitrary The end of distinctions means the triumph of the strong over the weak the pitting of father against sonthe end of all human justice which is here unexpectedly defined in terms of differences among individuals If perfect equilibrium invariably leads to violence as in Greek tragedy it follows that the relative nonviolence guaranteed by human justice must be defined as a sort of imbalance a difference between good and evil parallel to the sacrificial difference between pure and impure The idea of justice as a balanced scale an exercise in exquisite impartiality is utterly foreign to this theory which sees the roots of justice in differences among men and the demise of justice in the elimination of these differences Whenever the terrible equilibrium of tragedy prevails all talk of right and wrong is futile At that point in the conflict one can only say to the combatants Make friends or pursue your own ruin 52 Violence and the Sacred 4 IF THE TWOINONE crisis that we have described is indeed a fundamental realityif the collapse of the cultural structure of a society leads to reciprocal violence and if this collapse encourages the spread of violence everywherethen we ought to see signs of this reality outside the restricted realms of Greek tragedy or Shakespearean drama The closer our contact with primitive societies the more rapidly these societies tend to lose their distinctive qualities but this loss is in some cases effected through a sacrificial crisis And in some cases these crises have been directly observed by ethnologists Scholarly literature on the subject is rather extensive rarely however does a coherent picture emerge More often than not the accounts are fragmentary mingled with commentary relating to purely structural matters A remarkable exception well worth our attention here is Jules Henrys Jungle People which deals with the Kaingang Indians of Santa Katarina in Brazil2 The author came to live with the Indians shortly after they had been transferred to a reservation when the consequences of that last and radical change had not yet completely taken hold He was thus able to observe at first hand or through the testimony of witnesses the process I call the sacrificial crisis The extreme poverty of the Kaingang culture on a religious as well as a technological level made a strong impression on Henry who attributed it to the blood feuds that is the cyclical vengeance carried on among close relatives To describe the effects of this reciprocal violence he instinctively turned to the hyperbolic imagery of the great myths in particular to the image of plague Feuds spread cleaving the society asunder like a deadly axe blighting its life like the plague3 These are the very symptoms that we have made bold to identify with the sacrificial crisis or crisis of distinctions The Kaingang seem to have abandoned all their old mythology in favor of stories of actual acts of revenge When discussing internecine murders they seem to be fitting together the pans of a machine the intricate workings of which they know precisely Their absorbed interest in the history of their own destruction has impressed on their minds with flawless clarity the multitudinous crossworkings of feuds4 Although the Kaingang blood feuds represent the decadence of a system that once enjoyed relative stability the

Indians who are said to travel together that is go out together on hunting expeditions However this group is always small in number and the relative peace that reigns within it is in sharp contrast to the violence that rages triumphantly outsidebetween the different groups Within the group there is a spirit of conciliation The most inflammatory challenges pass unacknowledged adultery which provokes an instant and bloody reprisal among members of rival groups is openly tolerated As long as violence does not cross a certain threshold of intensitv it remains sacrificial and defines an inner circle of nonviolence essential to the accomplishment of basic social functionsthat is to the survival of the society Nonetheless the moment arrives when the inner group is contaminated As soon as they are installed on a reservation members of a group tend to turn against one another They can no longer polarize their aggressions against outside enemies the others the different men5 The chain of killings finally reaches the heart of the individual group At this point the very basis of the social life of the group is challenged In the case of the Kaingang outside factorsprimarily the Brazilian authoritiesintervened assuring the physical survival of the last remnants of the Kaingang while guaranteeing the extinction of their culture In acknowledging the existence of an internal process of selfdestruction among the Kaingang we are not attempting to diminish or dismiss the part played by the white man in this tragedy The problem of Brazilian responsibility would not be resolved even if the new settlers had refrained from using hired assassins to speed up the process of destruction Indeed it is worth asking whether the impetus behind the Kaingang s dismemberment of their culture and the inexorable character of their selfdestruction were not ultimately due to the pressure of a foreign culture Even if this were the case cyclical violence still presents a threat to any society whether or not it is under pressure from a foreign culture or from any other external interference The process is basically internal Such is Henrys conclusion after contemplating the terrible plight of the Kaingang He uses the phrase social suicide and we must admit that the potentiality for such selfdestruction always exists In the course of history a number of communities doubtless succumbed to

mythological figures demonic and divine generally spoken of as different things 54 Violence and the Sacred their own violent impulses and disappeared without a trace Even if we have certain reservations about his interpretation of the case under discussion Henrys conclusions have direct pertinence to numberless groups of human beings whose histories remain unknown This group excellently suited in their physical and psychological endowments to cope with the rigors of their natural environment were yet unable to withstand the internal forces that were disrupting their society and having no culturally standardized devices to deal with them were committing social suicide6 The fear generated by the killorbekilled syndrome the tendency to anticipate violence by lashing out first akin to our contemporary concept of preventive war cannot be explained in purely psychological terms The notion of a sacrificial crisis is designed to dissipate the psychological illusion even in those instances when Henry borrows the language of psychology it is clear that he does not share the illusion In a universe both deprived of any transcendental code of justice and exposed to violence everybody has reason to fear the worst The difference between a projection of ones own paranoia and an objective evaluation of circumstances has been worn away7 Once that crucial distinction has vanished both psychology and sociology falter The professional observer who distributes good or bad marks to individuals and cultures on the basis of their normality and abnormality is obliged to make his observations from the particular perspective of someone who does not run the risk of being killed Psychologists and other social scientists ordinarily suppose a peaceable substructure for their subjects indeed they tend to take this pacific quality for granted Yet nothing in their mode of reasoning which they like to regard as radically enlightened solidly based and free of idealistic nonsense justifies such an assumptionas Henrys study makes clear With a single murder the murderer enters a locked system He must kill and kill again he must plan whole massacres lest a single survivor remain to avenge his kin8 Henry encountered some particularly bloodthirsty specimens among the Kaingang but he also fell in with individual members of the tribe 6 Henry Jungle People p 7 7 When Yakwa says to me My cousin wants to kill me I know he wants to kill his cousin who slaughtered his pigs for rooting up his corn and when he says Eduardo the Agent is angry with me I realize that he is angry with the Agent for not having given him a shirt Yakwas state of mind is a pale reflection of the Kaingang habit of projecting their own hate and fear into the minds of those whom they hate and fear Yet one cannot always be sure that it is just a projection for in these feuds currents of danger may radiate from any number of points of conflict and there is often good and sufficient cause for any fear ibid p 54 8 Ibid p 53 The Sacrificial Crisis 55 vho were peaceable and perspicacious and who sought in vain to free hemselves from the machinery of destruction Kaingang murderers re like characters of a Greek tragedy in the grip of a natural law vhose processes once started can never be stayed9  B   ALTHOUGH THEY APPROACHED THE SUBect more obliquely the Greek tragedians were concerned like Jules rlenry with the destruction of a cultural order The violent recirocity that engulfs their characters is a manifestation of this detractive process Our own concern with sacrificial matters shows the vital role the ritualistic crisisthe abolition of all distinctionsplays in the formation of tragedy In turn a study of tragedy can clarify the lature of this crisis and those aspects of primitive religion that are inseparably linked to it For in the final analysis the sole purpose of religion is to prevent the recurrence of reciprocal violence I am inclined then to assert that tragedy opens a royal way to the great dilemmas of religious ethnology Such a stand will no doubt elicit the scorn of scientific researchers as well as fervent Hellenophiles from the defenders of traditional humanism to the disciples of Nietzsche and Heidegger The scientifically inclined have a tendency to regard literary folk as dubious company whose society grows increasingly dangerous as their own efforts remain obstinately theoretical As for the Hellenophiles they are quick to see blasphemy in any parallel drawn between classical Greece and primitive societies It is essential to make it clear once and for all that to draw on tragic literature does not mean to relinquish scholarly standards of research nor does it constitute a purely esthetic approach to the subject At the same time we must manage to appease the men of letters who tremble at the thought of applying scientific methods of any kind to literature convinced as they are that such methods can only lead to facile reductionism of the works of art to sterile analyses that disregard the spirit of the literature The conflict between the two cultures science and literature rests on a common failure a negative complicity shared by literary critics and religious specialists Neither group perceives the underlying principle on which their objects are based The tragedians seem to have labored in vain to make this principle manifest They never achieve more than partial success and their efforts are perpetually undone by the differentiations imposed on their work by literary critics and social scientists Ethnologists are not unaware that ritual impurity is linked to the dissolution of distinctions between individuals and institutions10 HowIbid 1 0 Cf Mary Douglas Purity and Danger London 1966 56 Violence and the Sacred ever they fail to recognize the dangers inherent in this dissolution As we have noted the modern mind has difficulty conceiving of violence in terms of a loss of distinctions or of a loss of distinctions in terms of violence Tragedy can help to resolve this difficulty if we agree to view the plays from a radical perspective Tragic drama addresses itself to a burning issuein fact to the burning issue The issue is never directly alluded to in the plays and for good reason since it has to do with the dissolution by reciprocal violence of those very values and distinctions around which the conflict of the plays supposedly revolves Because this subject is tabooand even more than taboo almost unspeakable in the language devoted to distinctions literary critics proceed to obscure with their own meticulously differentiated categories the relative lack of difference between antagonists that characterizes a tragic confrontation in classical drama The primitive mind in contrast has no difficulty imagining an affiliation between violence and nondifferentiation and indeed is often obsessed by the possible consequences of such a union Natural differences are conceived in terms of cultural differences and vice versa Where we would view the loss of a distinctive quality as a wholly natural phenomenon having no bearing on human relationships the primitive man might well view this occurrence with deep dread Because there is no real difference between the various modes of differentiation there is in consequence no difference between the manner in which things fail to differ the disappearance of natural differences can thus bring to mind the dissolution of regulations pertaining to the individuals proper place in societythat is can instigate a sacrificial crisis Once we have grasped this fact certain religious phenomena never explained by traditional approaches suddenly become intelligible A brief glance at one of the more spectacular of these phenomena will I think serve to demonstrate the usefulness of applying the tragic tradition to religious ethnology In some primitive societies twins inspire a particular terror It is not unusual for one of the twins and often both to be put to death The origin of this terror has long puzzled ethnologists Today the enigma is presented as a problem of classification Two individuals suddenly appear where only one had been expected in those societies that permit them to survive twins often display a single social personality The problem of classification as defined by structuralism does not justify the death of the twins The reasons that prompt men to do away with certain of their children are undoubtedly bad reasons but they are not frivolous ones Culture is not merely a The Sacrificial Crisis 51 jigsaw puzzle where the extra pieces are discarded once the picture has been completed If the problem of classification becomes crucial that is because its implications are crucial Twins invariably share a cultural identity and they often have a striking physical resemblance to each other Wherever differences are lacking violence threatens Between the biological twins and the sociological twins there arises a confusion that grows more troubled as the question of differences reaches a crisis It is only natural that twins should awaken fear for they are harbingers of indiscriminate violence the greatest menace to primitive societies As soon as the twins of violence appear they multiply prodigiously by scissiparity as it were and produce a sacrificial crisis It is essential to prevent the spread of this highly contagious disease When faced with biological twins the normal reaction of the culture is simply to avoid contagion The way primitive societies attempt to accomplish this offers a graphic demonstration of the kind of danger they associate with twins In societies where their very existence is considered dangerous the infants are exposed that is abandoned outside the community under conditions that make their death inevitable Any act of direct physical violence against the anathema is scrupulously avoided Any such act would only serve to entrap the perpetrators in a vicious circle of violencethe trap bad violence sets for the community and baits with the birth of twins An inventory of the customs prescriptions and interdictions relating to twins in those societies where they are regarded with dread reveals one common concern the fear of pollution The divergences from one culture to the next are easily explained in terms of the religious attitudes denned above which pertain to the strictly empiricalthat is terrorstrickencharacter of the precautions taken against bad violence In the case of twins the precautions are misdirected nevertheless they become quite intelligible once we recognize the terror that inspires them Although the menace is somewhat differently perceived from society to society it is fundamentally the same everywhere and a challenge with which all religious institutions are obliged to cope The Nyakyusa maintain that the parents of twins are contaminated by bad violence and there is a certain logic about that notion since the parents are after all responsible for engendering the twins In reference to the twins the parents are designated by a term that is applied to all threatening individuals all monstrous or terrifying creatures In order to prevent the spread of pollution the parents are re5 Violence and the Sacred quired to isolate themselves and submit to rites of purification only then are they allowed to rejoin the community11 It is not unreasonable to believe that the relatives and close friends of the twins parents as well as their immediate neighbors are those most directly exposed to the infection Bad violence is by definition a force that works on various levelsphysical familial socialand spreads from one to the other Twins are impure in the same way that a warrior steeped in carnage is impure or an incestuous couple or a menstruating woman All forms of violence lead back to violence We overlook this fact because the primitive concept of a link between the loss of distinctions and violence is strange to us but we need only consider the calamities primitive people associate with twins to perceive the logic of this concept Deadly epidemics can result from contact with twins as can mysterious illnesses that cause sterility in women and animals Even more significant to us is the role of twins in provoking discord among neighbors a fatal collapse of ritual the transgression of interdictions in short their part in instigating a sacrificial crisis As we have seen the sacred embraces all those forces that threaten to harm man or trouble his peace Natural forces and sickness are not distinguished from the threat of a violent disintegration of the community Although manmade violence plays a dominant role in the dialectics of the sacred and is never completely omitted from the warnings issued by religion it tends to be relegated to the background and treated as if it emanated from outside man One might say that it has been deliberately hidden away almost out of sight behind forces that are genuinely exterior to man Behind the image of twins lurks the baleful aspect of the sacred perceived as a disparate but formidably unified force The sacrificial crisis can be viewed as a general offensive of violence directed against the community and there is reason to fear that the birth of twins might herald this crisis In the primitive societies where twins are not killed they often enjoy a privileged position This reversal corresponds to the attitudes we have noted in regard to menstrual blood Any phenomenon linked to impure violence is capable of being inverted and rendered beneficent but this can take place only within the immutable and rigorous framework of ritual practice The purifying and pacifying aspects of violence take precedence over its destructive aspects The apparition of twins then if properly handled may in certain societies be seen to presage good events not bad ones 11 Monica Wilson Rituals of Kinship among the Nyakyusa Oxford 1957 The Sacrificial Crisis 59 f IF THE STATEMENTS ABOVE ARE VALID two brothers need not be twins for their resemblances to arouse anxiety We can assume almost a priori that in some societies the mere fact of familial similarity is cause for alarm The verification of such a hypothesis would I believe confirm the inadequacy of previous theories regarding twins If the twin phobia can be extended to other members of the family it can no longer be explained solely in terms of a problem of classification Twins could no longer be said to cause alarm because two individuals had turned up where only one was expected their physical resemblance would nowT be perceived as the disruptive factor At this point we may well wonder how something so commonplace as the resemblance between siblings can be officially proscribed without causing enormous inconvenience not to say total chaos After all a community cannot categorize a majority of its inhabitants as probationary criminals without creating an intolerable situation Nevertheless the phobia of resemblance is a fact Malinowskis The father in Primitive Psychology offers formal proof The study demonstrates how the phobia can perpetuate itself without disastrous consequences The ingenuity of man or rather of his cultural systems copes with the problem by categorically denying the existence of the dreaded phenomenon or even its possibility In a matrilineal society as in the Trobriands where all maternal relatives are considered to be of the same body and the father to be a stranger we would naturally expect and have no doubt that the facial and bodily similarity would be traced to the mothers family alone The contrary is the case and this is affirmed with an extremely strong social emphasis Not only is it a household dogma so to speak that a child never resembles its mother any of its brothers or sisters or any of its maternal kinsmen but it is extremely bad form and a great offence to hint at any such similarity    I was introduced to this rule of savoir vivre in the usual way by making a faux pas One of my bodyguards in Omarakana named Moradeda was endowed with a peculiar cast of features which had struck me at first sight    One day I was struck by the appearance of an exact counterpart to Moradeda and asked his name and whereabouts When I was told that he was my friends elder brother living in a distant village 1 exclaimed Ah truly I asked about you because your face is alike alike to that of Moradeda There came such a hush over all the assembly that 1 noticed it at once The man turned round and left us while part of the company present after looking away in a manner halfembarrassed halfoffended soon dispersed I was then told by my confidential informants that I had committed a breach of custom that I had perpetrated 60 Violence and the Sacred what is called taputaki migila a technical expression referring only to this act which might be translated ltodefilebyconiparingtoakinsmanhisface What astonished me in this discussion was that in spite of the striking resemblance between the two brothers my informants refused to admit it In fact they treated the question as if no one could possibly ever resemble his brother or for the matter of that any maternal kinsman I made my informants quite angry and displeased with me by arguing the point This incident taught me never to hint at such a resemblance in the presence of the people concerned But I thrashed the matter out well with many natives in subsequent general conversations I found that every one in the Trobriands will in the teeth of all the evidence deny stoutly that similarity can exist between matrilineal kinsmen You simply irritate and insult a Trobriander if you point to striking instances exactly as you irritate your nextdoor neighbor in our own society if you bring before him a glaring truth which contradicts some of his cherished opinions political religious or moral or which is still worse runs counter to his personal interests1Negation here serves as affirmation There would be nothing untoward in mentioning resemblances if they were not a matter of great importance To accuse two close relatives of resembling one another is to assert that they are a menace to the community the carriers of an infectious disease Malinowski tells us further that the accusation is a traditional form of insult among the Trobriands the most wounding at their disposal His account inspires confidence precisely because he presents the phenomenon as a complete enigma proposing no interpretation of his own On the other hand the Trobriands not only tolerate references to the resemblance between fathers and children but virtually demand its acknowledgment This society formally denies the fathers role in the reproductive process between father and children then no parental link is said to exist Malinowskis description demonstrates that a paternal resemblance is perceived by the Trobriands paradoxically enough in terms of differences It is the father who serves to differentiate the children from one another He is literally the bearer of a difference among whose characteristics we recognize the phallic element so dear to psychoanalysts Because the father sleeps with the mother because he is so often near her he is said to mold the face of the child Malinowski informs us that the word kulicoagulate mold leave an impression recurred constantly in the discussions of resemblances The father evidently represents form the mother matter In this capacity the 12 Bronislaw Malinowski The Father in Vrirmtvve Psychology New York 1966 pp 8891 The Sacrificial Crisis 61 father makes the children different from their mother and from one another That explains why the children resemble him and why a resemblance to the father common to all children does not imply a resemblance of one child to another It was often pointed out to me how strongly one or the other of the sons of Touluwa chief of Omarakana resembled his father   Whenever I pointed out that this similarity to the father implied similarity among each other such a heresy was indignantly repudiated13 At this point it seems appropriate to juxtapose the basic mythical theme of enemy brothers with the phobia concerning twins and other fraternal resemblances Clyde Kluckhohn asserts that the most common of all mythical conflicts is the struggle between brothers which generally ends in fratricide In some regions of black Africa the mythical protagonists are brothers born in immediate sequence14 If I understand this phrase correctly it includes twins but is not strictly limited to them The continuity between the theme of twins and the fraternal motif in general is not peculiar to the Trobriand Islands Even when the brothers are not twins the difference between them is less than that between all other degrees of relations They share the same mother father gender in most instances they occupy the same position in respect to other relatives both close and distant Brothers seem to have more rights duties and functions in common than other family members Twins are in a sense reinforced brothers whose final objective difference that of age has been removed it is virtually impossible to distinguish between them We instinctively tend to regard the fraternal relationship as an affectionate one yet the mythological historical and literary examples that spring to mind tell a different story Cain and Abel Jacob and Esau Eteocles and Polyneices Romulus and Remus Richard the LionHearted and John Lackland The proliferation of enemy brothers in Greek myth and in dramatic adaptations of myth implies the continual presence of a sacrificial crisis repeatedly alluded to in the same symbolic terms The fraternal theme is no less contagious qua theme for being buried deep in the text than is the malevolent violence that accompanies it In fact the theme itself is a form of violence When Polyneices departs from Thebes leaving his brother to take his turn on the throne he carries the fraternal conflict with him as an integral part of his being Everywhere he goes he literally draws from the earth the brother who seems expressly designed to thwart him just  Ibid p 92 14 Clyde Kluckhohn Recurrent Themes in Myths and Mythmaking in Myth and Mythmaking ed Henry A Murray Boston 1968 p 52 62 Violence and the Sacred as Cadmus sowed the dragons teeth and brought forth a harvest of fully armed warriors ready to do battle with one another An oracle had announced to Adrastus that his two daughters would marry a lion and a wild boar respectivelyanimals very different in appearance but of equally violent temper In Euripides Supplices Adrastus recounts how he came upon his future sonsinlaw Polyneices and Tydeus both povertystricken exiles who were fighting for shelter outside his door Adrastus The two exiles came to my door one

sistersreconstituting as it were a properly fraternal relationshipall conspire to recreate the PolyneicesEteocles relationship and indeed all other instances of fraternal rivalry Once our attention has been drawn to the distinctive traits of fraternal strife we seem to rediscover them recurring singly or in clusters throughout classical myth and tragedy In addition to true brothers such as Eteocles and Polyneices we find brothersinlaw that is quasibrothers like Polyneices and Tydeus Oedipus and Creon or other close relatives of the same generation like the first cousins Pentheus and Dionysus Ultimately the insufficient difference in the family relationships serves to symbolize the dissolution of family distinctions in other words it desymbolizes Such relationships thus finally contribute to the symmetry of conflicts that is concealed in mrth but vigorously proclaimed in tragedy which betrays this hidden process simply by representing the mythological material on stage Nothing can be further from the truth than the statement that tragedy lacks universality because it is totally preoccupied with family distinctions It is the elimination of these distinctions that leads directly to fraternal strife and to the religious phobia regarding twins The two themes are essentially the same however there is a shade of difference between them that deserves our attention Twins offer a symbolic representation sometimes remarkably eloThe Sacrificial Crisis 63 quent of the symmetrical conflict and identity crisis that characterize the sacrificial crisis But the resemblance is entirely accidental There is no real connection between biological and sociological twins twins are no more predisposed to violence than any other menor at least any other brothers There is something decidedly arbitrary about the relationship between sacrificial crises and the essential quality of twinship which is not of the same order of arbitrariness as that of the linguistic sign since the representative element is always present Ultimately the classic definition of the symbol seems to apply to the correspondence between twins and the sacrificial crisis In the case of fraternal strife the representative element becomes blurred Fraternal relationships normally take form within the framework of the family where differences no matter how small are readily recognized and acknowledged In passing from twins to the general category of brothers we lose something on the level of symbolic representation but gain something on that of social reality in fact the shift puts our feet securely on the ground Because in most societies the fraternal relationship implies only a minimum of differences it obviously constitutes a vulnerable point in a system structured on differences a point dangerously exposed to the onset of a sacrificial crisis The fear of twins qua twins is clearly mythic and has little basis in reality but one can hardly say the same for the thematic concern with fraternal rivalry It is not only in myths that brothers are simultaneously drawn together and driven apart by something they both ardently desire and which they will not or cannot sharea throne a woman or in more general terms a paternal heritage Rival brothers unlike twins straddle both forms of desymbolization the purely symbolic and the concrete varietythe variety that constitutes the true sacrificial crisis In some African monarchies the death of the king precipitates a struggle for the succession and transforms the kings sons into fraternal enemies It is difficult if not impossible to determine to what extent this struggle is symbolic a matter of ritual and to what extent it is a real historical event pregnant with unforeseen consequences In other words it is hard to know whether one is dealing with a reallife struggle or with ritual mimicry whose cathartic effects are believed to ward off the impending crisis it imitates so faithfully If we have difficulty grasping what twins or even rival brothers represent it is because we do not consider their presence a genuine threat We cannot imagine how the mere appearance of a pair of twins or rival brothers can convey the entire course of sacrificial crisis how the pair can epitomize the entire crisis in terms not of formal rhetoric but of real violence Any violent effacement of differences even if 64 Violence and the Sacred initially restricted to a single pair of twins reaches out to destroy a whole society We cannot be held entirely responsible for our lack of comprehension None of the mythological themes can by itself point to the truth concerning the sacrificial crisis In the case of twins symmetry and identity are represented in extraordinarily explicit terms nondifference is present in concrete literal form but this form is itself so exceptional as to constitute a new difference Thus the representation of nondifference ultimately becomes the very exemplar of difference a classic monstrosity that plays a vital role in sacred ritual In the case of enemy brothers the domestic context in which they operate brings us back into contact with reality we are no longer dealing with outlandish phenomena that provoke either amusement or dread But the very concreteness of the conflict tends to efface its symbolic significance to lend it the character of a real historical event With enemy brothers as with twins the sign cannot fail to betray the thing signified because that thing is the destruction of all signification It is violent reciprocity on the rampage everywhere that truly destroys differences yet this process can never be fully signified Either a degree of difference survives and we remain within the framework of a cultural order surrounded by meanings that ought to have been wiped out Or perhaps all differences have indeed been effaced but the nondifference immediately appears as a new and outlandish difference a monstrosity such as twins for example Being made up of differences language finds it almost impossible to express undifferentiation directly Whatever it may say on the subject language invariably says at once too much and too little even in such concise statements as Each thing meetsIn mere oppugnancy or sound and furySignifying nothing No matter how diligently language attempts to catch hold of it the reality of the sacrificial crisis invariably slips through its grasp It invites anecdotal history on the one hand and on the other a visitation of monsters and grotesques Mythology succumbs to the latter tragedy is constantly threatened by the former Monstrosities recur throughout mythology From this we can only conclude that myths make constant reference to the sacrificial crisis but do so only in order to disguise the issue Myths are the retrospective transfiguration of sacrificial crises the reinterpretation of these crises in the light of the cultural order that has arisen from them The traces of sacrificial crisis are less distinct in myth than in tragedy Or rather tragedy is by its very nature a partial deciphering of mythological motifs The poet brings the sacrificial crisis back to life he pieces together the scattered fragments of reciprocity and balances The Sacrificial Crisis 65 elements thrown out of kilter in the process of being mythologized He whistles up a storm of violent reciprocity and differences are swept away in this storm just as they were previously dissolved in the real crisis that must have generated the mythological transfiguration Tragedy envelops all human relationships in a single tragic antagonism It does not differentiate between the fraternal conflict of Eteocles and Polyneices the fatherson conflict of Alcestis or Oedipus the King the conflict between men who share no ancestral ties such as Oedipus and Tiresias The rivalry of the two prophets is indistinguishable from the rivalry between brothers Tragedy tends to restore violence to mythological themes It in part fulfills the dire forebodings primitive men experience at the sight of twins It spreads the pollution abroad and multiplies the mirror images of violence Tragedy has a particular affinity for myth but that does not mean it takes the same course The term desymbolism is more appropriate to tragedy than is symbolism It is because most of the symbols of the sacrificial crisisin particular the symbol of the enemy brotherlend themselves so readily to both the tragic and the ritual situations that tragedy has been able to operate at least to some extent within and also contrary to mythological patterns I have already noted this dual aspect of symbolic reference in connection with the monarchic succession in certain African states it is virtually impossible to determine whether the fraternal rivalry that occurs in that connection is ritualistic or part of the tragedy of history Symbolized reality becomes paradoxically the loss of all symbolism the loss of differences is necessarily betrayed by the differentiated expression of language The process is a peculiar one utterly foreign to our usual notions of symbolism Only a close reading of tragedy a radically symmetrical reading will help us to understand the phenomenon to penetrate to the source of tragic inspiration If the tragic poet touches upon the violent reciprocity underlying all myths it is because he perceives these myths in a context of weakening distinctions and growing violence His work is inseparable then from a new sacrificial crisis the one referred to at the opening of this chapter To know violence is to experience it Tragedy is therefore direcdy linked to violence it is a child of the sacrificial crisis The relationship between tragedy and myth as it is now taking shape can perhaps be understood more easily if we consider an analogous relationship that of the Old Testament prophets to the Pentateuchal texts they cite as exemplars For example we find in Jeremiah 935 Beware a brother for every brother plays the role of Jacob 66 Violence and the Sacred and every friend spreads scandal One deceives the other    Fraud upon fraud deceit upon deceit The concept of enemy brothers previously mentioned in connection with Jacob is precisely the same as the concept governing Euripides version of the EteoclesPolyneices story It is the symmetry of the conflict that defines the fraternal relationship and this symmetry originally limited to a few tragic heroes now reaches out to include the entire community It loses its particularized quality and acquires a predominantly social meaning The allusion to Jacob is subordinated to the main design which is the description of the sacrificial crisis violence engulfs the whole society all its members confronting one another as enemy brothers Specific stylistic effects underline the symmetry and mirror the violent reciprocity One deceives the other    Fraud upon fraud deceit upon deceit The books of the Old Testament are rooted in sacrificial crises each distinct from the other and separated by long intervals of time but analogous in at least some respects The earlier crises are reinterpreted in the light of the later ones And the experience of previous crises is of great value in coping with subsequent ones Jeremiahs treatment of the historical figure of Jacob seems to bear this out Contact has been established between the time of Genesis and the crisis of the sixth century as a result light is shed on both eras Like tragedy the prophetic act constitutes a return to violent reciprocity so it too levels all mythological distinctions and does so even more effectively than tragedy However this leads us to a subject that deserves separate consideration a subject I will turn to in another work Although the source of inspiration emerges more dimly and indirectly in tragedy than in biblical examples the pattern is the same The passage quoted above might well be taken for a fragment of a tragic drama drawn from the Book of Genesisa tragedy of enemy brothers perhaps Jacob and Esau Tragic and prophetic inspiration do not draw strength from historical or philological sources but from a direct intuitive grasp of the role played by violence in the cultural order and in disorder as well in mythology and in the sacrificial crisis England in the throes of religious upheaval provided Shakespeare with such an inspiration for his Troilus and Cressida There is no reason to believe that advances in scholarship will by the process of continuous enrichment so dear to the positivist cause increase our understanding of the great tragedies for however real and valuable this process may be it fails to touch on the true tragic spirit This spirit never widespread even in periods The Sacrificial Crisis 61 of crisis vanishes without a trace during periods of cultural stability At a given moment the violent effacement of distinctions ceases and the process begins to reverse itself giving way to mythical elaboration Mythical elaboration gives way in turn to the inverse operation of tragic inspiration What sets off these metamorphoses What mechanism governs the shift from cultural order to disorder This is the question that concerns us and this question elicits yet another which touches on the final stages of the sacrificial crisis Once violence has penetrated a community it engages in an orgy of selfpropagation There appears to be no way of bringing the reprisals to a halt before the community has been annihilated If there are really such events as sacrificial crises some son of braking mechanism an automatic control that goes into effect before everything is destroyed must be built into them In the final stages of a sacrificial crisis the very viability of human society is put in question Our task is to discover what these final stages involve and what makes them possible It is likely that they must serve as a point of departure for both ritual and myth Everything we can learn about this phase of the crisis then will enhance our knowledge of the nature of ritual and myth To find an answer to these questions let us address ourselves to one myth in particular the story of Oedipus Our previous investigations gave us reason to believe that the most useful approach lay by way of tragedy We will turn our attention therefore to Sophocles Oedipus the King l  Chapter Three Oedipus and the Surrogate Victim C  f 5 s y l  SOPHOCLES IS OFTEN PRAISED for having created      in Oedipus a highly individualized character Here it is said is a hero who is very much his own man And what sort of a man is he It is traditional to note both his generosity and his impulsiveness At the opening of the play we admire his noble serenity as he dedicates himself to solving the mystery of the plague that afflicts his subjects But the least obstacle delay or provocation suffices to upset his poise The diagnosis seems clear Oedipus is prone to fits of anger The king himself acknowledges this fault presenting it so it seems as that unique but fatal flaw without which a hero cannot attain tragic stature The noble serenity is in evidence first the fits of anger follow Tiresias provokes the initial outburst Creon the second In Oedipuss own account of his past life he informs us that he has frequently succumbed to this flaw He admits to overreacting to hasty phrases heedlessly uttered a drinking companion in Corinth had blurted out some remark casting doubt on Oedipuss parentage Oedipus reacted with an outburst of anger that precipitated his departure from the city And it was in a fit of anger that he struck down at the crossroads an old man who blocked his wav The description of his character seems unambiguous and anger is surely as good a word as any to use in describing the personal reactions of the hero However we cannot help asking ourselves whether these tantrums really serve to distinguish Oedipus from the other characters In other words can they be said to perform the differential function upon which the whole concept of character is based If we look closely at the myth we notice that anger crops up everywhere It was a kind of suppressed anger that incited Oedipuss companion at Corinth to cast doubt on the heros parentage At the fateful crossroads it was anger that goaded Laius initially to raise a hand against his son It was yet an earlier act of anger preceding any 6ft Oedipus and the Surrogate Victim 69 tctions by Oedipus that prompted the fathers decision to do away tvith his infant son It is clear that Oedipus has no monopoly on anger in the play Whatever the authors intentions there would be no tragic debate if the other protagonists did not become angry in turn It is true that these outbursts only occur after a certain delay and it is tempting to regard them as justified reprisals warranted by Oedipuss inexcusable and provoking displays of temper But we have seen that Oedipuss anger is never without antecedents it is always preceded and determined by an initial outburst Even that initial anger is never truly the original anger In the domain of impure violence any search for origins leads back to myth One cannot engage in a search of this sort much less place any credence in the ultimate success of such a search without destroying violent reciprocity without in short having recourse to those very mythological distinctions from which tragedy is striving to extricate itself Tiresias and Creon keep their tempers at the outset their initial serenity is matched by Oedipuss own serenity in the first episode In fact we have to do with an alternation of calm and anger The only distinction between Oedipus and his adversaries is that Oedipus initiates the contest triggering the tragic plot He thus has a certain head start on the others But though the action does not occur simultaneously its symmetry is absolute Each protagonist in turn occupies the same position in regard to the same object This object is none other than the particular tragic conflict whose association with the plague we have already noted and will explore in more detail further on At first each of the protagonists believes that he can quell the violence at the end each succumbs to it All are drawn unwittingly into the structure of violent reciprocitywhich they always think they are outside of because they all initially come from the outside and mistake this positional and temporary advantage for a permanent and fundamental superiority The three protagonists believe themselves to be above the battle After all Oedipus is not from Thebes Creon is not king and Tiresias is soaring aloft high amid the clouds Creon returns from Thebes armed with the latest oracle Oedipus and especially Tiresias bring to bear their formidable divinatory skills In this capacity7 they possess all the prestige of the modern expert whose services are reserved for exceptionally difficult cases Each believes himself to be an impartial observer detached from the action each wants to assume the role of arbitrator and judge The solemnity of the three sages rapidly gives way to fury however when each sees his prestige challengedif only by the silence of the other two 10 Violence and the Sacred The force exerted by the three men in the struggle corresponds to each mans illusion of superiority his hubris In other words nobody possesses sophrosyne and on that level too the differences among them are illusory or quickly effaced The passage from calm to anger is in each case rendered inevitable It seems arbitrary therefore to relegate to Oedipus as a distinctive character trait an attribute shared equally by allespecially if this common attribute is drawn from the tragic context of the play and provides a more coherent interpretation than the psychological approach allows Far from bringing differences into sharp relief the plunge into opposition reduces the protagonists to a uniform condition of violence they are engulfed in the same storm of passion A single glance at an Oedipus drunk with violence and eager to engage him in dialogue convinces TLresias that he has been led astray But the knowledge comes too late Alas alas how terrible to know the truth when this knowledge serves for naught I was not totally ignorant of this truth but had thrust it from mv mind Otherwise I would not have come Tragedy is not a matter of differing opinions The symmetrical quality of the conflict determines the limits of the tragic inspiration And in asserting that there is no difference between the antagonists in a tragedy we are saying that ultimately there is no difference between the true and the false prophet The statement seems ridiculous even unthinkable at first glance For does not Tiresias proclaim the truth about Oedipus at the outset while Oedipus is vilifying Tiresias with odious calumnies With Tiresiass entrance our quest for symmetry receives a sharp rebuff As soon as it catches sight of this stately personage the chorus exclaims Here approaches the most inspired of prophets he alone who is the keeper of hidden truth Clearly we are dealing here with the infallible and omniscient prophet the sole possessor of an indubitable verity long ripened in the keeping For once it seems difference has triumphed However some lines further on this difference is eclipsed we encounter a resurgence of reciprocity more explicit than ever Tiresias himself rejects the traditional interpretation of his role the very one proposed by the chorus In reply to Oedipus who has questioned him derisively on the origins of his prophetic gifts Tiresias denies that he possesses any truth except the truth conferred on him by Oedipus himself Oedipus Who taught you truth Was it part of your training as a prophet Tiresias You taught me in forcing me to speak against my will Oedipus and the Surrogate Victim 11 If we take Tiresiass reply literally the terrible charges of patricide and incest that he has just leveled at Oedipus did not stem from any supernatural source of information The accusation is simply an act of reprisal arising from the hostile exchange of a tragic debate Oedipus unintentionally initiates the process by forcing Tiresias to speak He accuses Tiresias of having had a part in the murder of Laius he prods Tiresias into reprisal into hurling the accusation back at him The only difference between the initial accusation and the countercharge is the paradoxical quality of the latter This quality which could well be a weakness in fact becomes an added strength Tiresias not content to answer Oedipuss You are guilty by echoing You are guilty underlines what from his point of view is the most scandalous aspect of the accusationa guilty man is leveling the charge You pronounce me guilty and think yourself innocent whereas O wondrous world the guilty one is you The criminal you pursue is none other than Oedipus To accuse the other of Laiuss murder is to attribute to him sole responsibility for the sacrificial crisis but as we have seen everybody shares equal responsibility because everybody participates in the destruction of a cultural order The blows exchanged by enemy brothers may not always land on their mark but every one of them deals a staggering blow to the institutions of monarchy and religion Each party progresses rapidly in uncovering the truth about the other without ever recognizing the truth about himself Each sees in the other the usurper of a legitimacy that he thinks he is defending but that he is in fact undermining Anything one may affirm or deny about either of the adversaries seems instantly applicable to the other Reciprocity is busy aiding each party in his own destruction The tragic debate is clearly the verbal equivalent of the fight between such enemy brothers as Eteocles and Polyneices In a series of replies Tiresias warns Oedipus of the purely reciprocal nature of the approaching tragedy that is of the blows that each wrill inflict on the other As far as I know nobody has proposed a satisfactory interpretation of these lines The very rhythm of the phrases their symmetrical effects anticipate and provoke the tragic debate We see here violent reciprocity in action canceling all distinctions between the two men Enough Let me go home now If you follow my advice we will both find it easier to bear our separate destinies    Ah I see that your own words fall wide of the mark and I fear to have no better success with mine    I do not want to inflict pain on either of us    12 Violence and the Sacred You reproach me for my stubbornness but refuse to see the stubbornness that dwells within vou and therefore out of stubbornness cast blame on The violent elimination of differences between the antagonists their total identity suddenly illuminates these responses which give perfect expression to the true nature of tragic relationships The fact that these responses even today still seem obscure confirms our lack of understanding It should be said however that there is good reason for this lack one cannot persevere in bringing to light the symmetrical quality of tragedyas we are now doingwithout contradicting the fundamental implications of the myth If the myth does not explicitly set forth the problem of differences it nonetheless manages to resolve the problem in a matter both brutal and categorical The solution involves patricide and incest In the mythical version of the story the issue of reciprocitythe identity of Oedipus with the othersnever arises One can assert with lotal conviction that Oedipus is unique in at least one respect he alone is guilty of patricide and incest He is presented as a monstrous exception to the general run of mankind he resembles nobody and nobody resembles him The tragedians version of the Oedipus story differs radically from the myth indeed it is impossible to do justice to this presentation without abandoning the myth altogether Interpreters of Sophocles play invariably devise compromises that conceal the underlying contradiction between the tragedy and the myth I shall not have recourse to these venerable compromises nor try to invent new ones My quest leads elsewhere I intend to trace the tragic vein to its source if only to see where it leads I hope this exploration will yield something of value about the genesis of the myth First let us return to the issues of patricide and incest and attempt to determine whether these crimes can be attributed to one particular protagonist and to one alone As we have seen the tragedy transforms the murder of Laius and the patricide and incest themselves into an exchange of mutual incriminations Oedipus and Tiresias each attempt to place the blame for the citys plight on the other the accusations of patricide and incest are only especially striking contributions to a conventional exchange of incivilities At this stage of the debate there is no reason to assume that either party is more guilty of any crime than the other Both sides seem equally matched neither seems able to gain the upper hand The myth breaks the deadlock however and does so unequivocally We must now in the light of our understanding of Oedipus and the Surrogate Victim 75 tragic reciprocity examine on what basis and under what conditions the myth succeeds in intervening decisively in the struggle At this point a strange and wellnigh fantastic thought suggests itself If we eliminate the testimony brought against Oedipus in the second half of the tragedy then the conclusion of the myth far from seeming a sudden lightning flash of the truth striking down the guilty party and illuminating all the mortal participants seems nothing more than the camouflaged victory of one version of the story7 over the other the polemical version over its rivalthe communitys formal acceptance of Tiresiass and Creons version of the story thereafter held to be the true and universal version the verity behind the myth itself At this point the reader may well suspect that 1 harbor some strange illusions about the historical potential of these texts and about the information that one may reasonably expect to drawr out of them I hope that what follows will help to dissipate these fears However before proceeding I feel obliged to address myself to another type of objection that the present inquiry7 seems certain to attract Literary criticism concerns itself with tragedy mythology is outside its proper bailiwick Students of mythology on the other hand exclude tragedy from their area of concern and even display on occasion a hostile attitude toward it This division of labor harks back to Aristotle who declares in the Poetics that the competent tragic poet will avoid manipulating the myths and limit his borrowings from them to certain subjects This interdict of Aristotle still stands in the way of our confronting the symmetrical quality of tragedy and the mythical concern with differences which protects literature from mythology and also protects their respective specialists from the subversive consequences that might result from a confrontation It is precisely this confrontation I want to emphasize Indeed one cannot but wonder how attentive readers of Oedipus the King have managed to overlook it At the climactic moment of the tragic struggle Sophocles has inserted into his text two replies that seem to pertain directly to our reading Oedipuss imminent fall has nothing to do with any heinous sin rather it should be regarded as the outcome of a tragic encounter in which Oedipus has met defeat Oedipus replies to the chorus which has pleaded with him to spare Creon What you are asking if the truth be told is neither more nor less than my death or exile The chorus insists that Creon does not deserve punishment he should be allowed to withdraw in peace Oedipus yields to their re74 Violence and the Sacred quest but reluctantly and he reminds the chorus once again of the true nature of this struggle whose outcome is still unclear To spare an enemy brother from death or exile is to condemn oneself to death or exile Well then let him departthough his departure means my certain death or else my ignominious expulsion from Thebes Should we follow tradition and attribute such responses to the tragic illusion In that case the whole play and its wondrous equilibrium must also be a figment of this same illusion We will be on safer ground I believe if we turn our attention from tragic illusion to tragic vision I cannot help feeling that Sophocles himself is prompting us to do so Yet Sophocles himself remains elusive Tragic subversion has its limits if the playwright challenges the basis of the myth he only dares to do so in muted and devious fashion He does not want to compromise his own enterprise or demolish the mythological framework in which he operates We are left with no model or guide we are engaged in a cultural activity that remains undefined and we can have recourse to no known critical discipline What we are about to do is as novel to tragedy or literary criticism as it is to psychoanalysis or ethnology We must return once again to the socalled crimes of the son of Laius The act of regicide is the exact equivalent visavis the polis of the act of patricide visavis the family In both cases the criminal strikes at the most fundamental essential and inviolable distinction within the group He becomes literally the slayer of distinctions Patricide represents the establishment of violent reciprocity between father and son the reduction of the paternal relationship to fraternal revenge This reciprocity is explicitly indicated in the tragedy as we have noted Laius displays violence towards Oedipus even before his son actually attacks him When it has succeeded in abolishing even the traditional fatherson relationship violent reciprocity is left in sole command of the battlefield Its victory could hardly be more complete for in pitting father against son it has chosen as the basis of their rivalry an object solemnly consecrated as belonging to the father and formally forbidden the son that is the fathers wife and sons mother Incest is also a form of violence an extreme form and it plays in consequence an extreme role in the destruction of differences It destroys that other crucial family distinction that between the mother and her children Between patricide and incest the violent abolition of all family differences is achieved The process that links violence to the loss of distinctions will naturally perceive incest and patricide as its ultimate goals No possibilOedipus and the Surrogate Victim 15 ity of difference then remains no aspect of life is immune from the onslaught of violence1 Patricide and incest will thus be defined in terms of their consequences Oedipuss monstrosity is contagious it infects first of all those beings engendered by him The essential task is to separate once more the two strains of blood whose poisonous blend is now perpetuated by the natural process of generation Incestuous propagation leads to formless duplications sinister repetitions a dark mixture of unnamable things In short the incestuous creature exposes the community to the same danger as do twins These are indeed the manifestations real and transfigured of the sacrificial crisis always referred to by primitive societies in connection with incest Indeed the mothers of twins are often suspected of having conceived their children in incestuous fashion Sophocles attributes Oedipuss incest to the influence of the god Hymen who after all is directly implicated in the affair as the god of matrimonial laws and the regulator of family distinctions Hymen O Hymen to whom I owe my birth and who having engendered me employed the same seed in the same place to cast upon the outraged world a monstrous commingling of fathers brothers sons of brides wives and mothers In contradistinction to the Ulysses of Shakespeare and his crisis of Degree the Oedipus myth note that we are not referring here to the tragedy makes no effort to link patricide and incest to anything else not even to Laiuss abortive attempt at infanticide They are presented as separate events so anomalous that it is impossible to think of them as part of the tumult that rages around them involving elements of conflicting symmetry The dual disasters incest and patricide seem to be 1 In an essay entitled Ambiguite et renversement sur la structure enigmatique TOedtpe Roi JeanPierre Vernant has apdy defined this loss of cultural difference Patricide and incest he writes constitute    a direct violation of the game of draughts in which each piece stands in relation to the others at a specified place on the draught board of the city In effect the results of the two crimes are always expressed in terms of lost distinctions The equalization of Oedipus and his sons is expressed in a series of brutal images the father has sown his children in the same place where he himself was sown Jocasta is a wife not wife but mother whose furrows have yielded a double harvest of father and children she has been sown and from these same furrows these equal furrows he has obtained his children But it is left to Tiresias to endow this talk of equality with its true tragic weight when he addressed Oedipus in the following terms Evils will befall you which will establish an equality between yourself and your children in Echanges et co7tmiuritcationsy ed Jean Pouillon and Pierre Maranda The Hague 1970 p 425 16 Violence and the Sacred divorced from all context and visited on Oedipus alone either by pure chance or at the bidding of Destiny or some other sacred force Patricide and incest serve the same purpose here as do twins in many primitive religions The crimes of Oedipus signify the abolishment of differences but because the nondifference is attributed to a particular individual it is transformed into a new distinction signifying the monstrosity of Oedipuss situation The nondifference became the responsibility not of society at large but of a single individual Patricide and incest thus play the same role in the Oedipus myth as do the other mythical and ritual motifs considered previously They serve to conceal the sacrificial crisis far more effectively than they reveal it To be sure they manage to express both aspects of the crisis both reciprocity and forced similarities but they do so in a way that strikes terror into the beholder and suggests that they are the exclusive responsibility of a particular individual We lose sight of the fact that this same reciprocity operates among every member of the community and signifies the existence of a sacrificial crisis Another thematic device in addition to patricide and incest cloaks the sacrificial crisis in parallel and inverse fashion the motif of the plague or epidemic We have already referred to various epidemics as symbols of the sacrificial crisis Even if Sophocles had in mind the famous Athenian plague of 430 BC he clearly did not mean to limit his reference to one specific microbiotic visitation The epidemic that interrupts all the vital functions of the city is surelv not unrelated to violence and the   loss of distinctions The oracle itself explains matters it is the infectious presence of a murderer that has brought on the disaster The play makes it clear that the infection and the onslaught of reciprocal violence are one and the same The process by winch the three protagonists are each in turn tainted with violence corresponds to the progress of the disease always quick to lay low those who would contain it Without explicitly declaring the identical nature of the two strains the text nonetheless calls attention to their parallel qualities Begging Oedipus and Creon to end their quarrel the chorus exclaims The sight of this dying country fills me with anguish Must we now add to our misery the miseries which flow from you In tragedy and outside it as well plague is a symbol for the sacrificial crisis that is it serves the same function as patricide and incest It seems reasonable to ask why two different symbols are used when one would do and whether these two symbols really play identical roles We need only compare the two themesplague and patricideincest to remark how they differ and what this difference implies Vital aspects of the sacrificial crisis are apparent in both symbolic presentaOedipus and the Surrogate Victim 77 tions but they are differently distributed The plague motif illuminates but a single aspect the collective character of the disaster its universally contagious nature This motif ignores violence and the nondifferential character of the crisis With the patricideincest motif on the other hand violence and nondifference are presented in magnified and highly concentrated form but limited to a single individual Here it is the collective element that has been ignored Both the patricideincest and the plague motifs serve to disguise the presence of the sacrificial crisis but the disguises are not the same When viewed separately each appears unrecognizable without form One complements the other however and when they are brought together and uniformly applied to all members of the community the shape and substance of the crisis becomes clear Once again it is impossible to make any affirmative or negative judgements about the participants The responsibihtv for the events is evenly distributed among all If the crisis has dropped from sight if universal reciprocity is eliminated it is because of the unequal distribution of the very real parts of the crisis In fact nothing has been truly abolished nothing added but everything has been misplaced The whole process of mythical formulation leads to a transferral of violent undifferentiation from all the Thebans to the person of Oedipus Oedipus becomes the repository of all the communitvs ills In the myth the fearful transgression of a single individual is substituted for the universal onslaught of reciprocal violence Oedipus is responsible for the ills that have befallen his people He has become a prime example of the human scapegoat At the conclusion of his drama Sophocles has Oedipus address the Thebans in the terms best calculated to quell their doubts and fears He assures them that all the evils abroad in the community are the sole responsibility of the surrogate victim and that he alone as that victim must assume the consequences for these ills Believe me you have nothing more to fear My ills are mine alone no other mortal is fit to bear them Oedipus is indeed the responsible party so responsible that he frees the community from all accountability The concept of the plague is a result of this situation The plague is what remains of the sacrificial crisis when it has been emptied of all violence It calls to mind the passivity of the patient in the modern world of medicine Everyone is sick Nobody owes anybody anything by way of recompense or atonementexcept of course Oedipus If the community is to be freed of all responsibility for its unhappy condition and the sacrificial crisis converted into a physical disorder a plague the crisis must first be stripped of its violence Or rather this 18 Violence and the Sacred violence must be deflected to some individualin this case Oedipus In the course of the tragic debate all the characters do their utmost to assist in this process As we have seen the inquest on Laiuss death is in fact an investigation into the general subject of the sacrificial crisis and it is clearly a matter of pinning the responsibility for the troubled state of the community on some individual of framing a reply to the mythical question par excellence Who initiated the crisis Oedipus fails to fix the blame on Creon or Tiresias Creon and Tiresias are successful in their efforts to fix the blame on him The entire investigation is a feverish hunt for a scapegoat which finally turns against the very man who first loosed the hounds Having oscillated freely among the three protagonists the full burden of guilt finally settles on one It might very well have settled on another or on none What is the mysterious mechanism that determines how the guilt shall fall The attribution of guilt that henceforth passes for true differs in no way from those attributions that will henceforth be regarded as false except that in the case of the true guilt no voice is raised to protest any aspect of the charge A particular version of events succeeds in imposing itself it loses its polemical nature in becoming the acknowledged basis of the myth in becoming the myth itself The mythical attribution can only be defined as a phenomenon of unanimity xt the point where two three or hundreds of symmetrical and inverted accusations meet one alone makes itself heard and the others fall silent The old pattern of each against another gives way to the unified antagonism of all against one How does it happen that the communitys sense of unity destroyed by the sacrificial crisis is suddenly almost miraculously restored Here we are in the very midst of the crisis when all the circumstances seem to militate against any unified course of action It is impossible to find two men who agree on anything and each member of the community seems intent on transferring the collective burden of responsibility to the shoulders of his enemy brother Chaos reigns No connecting thread however tenuous links the conflicts antagonisms and obsessions that beset each individual Yet at this very moment when all seems lost when the irrational runs amok amid an infinite diversity of opinions the resolution of the dilemma is at hand The whole community now hurls itself into the violent unanimity that is destined to liberate it What is the source of this mysterious unanimity The antagonists caught up in the sacrificial crisis invariably believe themselves separated bv insurmountable differences In realitv however these differences gradually wear away Everywhere we now encounter the same Oedipus and the Surrogate Victim 19 desire the same antagonism the same strategiesthe same illusion of rigid differentiation within a pattern of everexpanding uniformity As the crisis grows more acute the community members are transformed into twins matching images of violence I would be tempted to saythat they are each doubles of the other In Romantic literature in the animistic theory of primitive religious practices and in modern psychiatry the term double is perceived as essentially unreal a projection of the imagination I mean something different here Although doubles in my use of the term convey certain hallucinatory associations which I shall discuss further on they are in themselves not at all imaginaryno more than the tragic symmetry of which they form the ideal expression is imaginary If violence is a great leveler of men and everybody becomes the double or twin of his antagonist it seems to follow that all the doubles are identical and that any one can at any given moment become the double of all the others that is the sole object of universal obsession and hatred A single victim can be substituted for all the potential victims for all the enemy brothers that each member is striving to banish from the community he can be substituted in fact for each and every member of the community Each members hostility caused by clashing against others becomes converted from an individual feeling to a communal force unanimously directed against a single individual The slightest hint the most groundless accusation can circulate with vertiginous speed and is transformed into irrefutable proof The corporate sense of conviction snowballs each member taking confidence from his neighbor by a rapid process of mimesis The firm conviction of the group is based on no other evidence than the unshakable unanimity of its own illogic The universal spread of doubles the complete effacement of differences heightening antagonisms but also making them interchangeable is the prerequisite for the establishment of violent unanimity For order to be reborn disorder must first triumph for myths to achieve their complete integration they must first suffer total disintegration Where only shortly before a thousand individual conflicts had raged unchecked between a thousand enemy brothers there now reappears a true community united in its hatred for one alone of its number All the rancors scattered at random among the divergent individuals all the differing antagonisms now converge on an isolated and unique figure the surrogate victim The general direction of the present hypothesis should now be abundantly clear any community that has fallen prey to violence or has been stricken by some overwhelming catastrophe hurls itself blindly into the search for a scapegoat Its members instinctively seek 80 Violence and the Sacred an immediate and violent cure for the onslaught of unbearable violence and strive desperately to convince themselves that all their ills are the fault of a lone individual who can be easily disposed of Such circumstances bring to mind the forms of violence that break out spontaneously in countries convulsed by crisis lynchings pogroms etc It is perhaps worth noting that these forms of collective violence generally justify themselves by making accusations of an Oedipal variety parricide incest infanticide Such comparisons are of only limited value but they shed some light They reveal a hidden connection among certain tragedies that at first glance seem utterly foreign to one another It is impossible to say whether Sophocles was aware of the full implications of his theme though to judge from the passages we have cited from Oedipus the King it is difficult to believe that he shared our ignorance It could well be that the tragic inspiration was neither more nor less than the sudden inkling of the origins of certain mythological themes This view seems to find support in other tragedies besides Oedipus and other tragedians besides Sophoclesin particular in the work of Euripides The heroine of Andromache is Neoptolemuss mistress Hermione is his wife The two women prime examples of enemy sisters engage in a tragic debate The humiliated wife accuses her rival of the typical crimes of parricide and incest those with which Tiresias charged Oedipus at the same crucial moment of another tragedy Have you woman no shame at all You do not scruple to sleep with the son of your husbands murderer Neoptolemuss father Achilles had killed Hector or to bear his children Such is the way of barbarians the father sleeps with the daughter the son with the mother the brother with the sister And they think nothing of killing one another nor does their law condemn the practice We want no such customs here The substitution is clear The foreigner Andromache is made to appear the incarnation of the sacrificial crisis that threatens the community She is declared capable of committing precisely those crimes that figure so predominantly in mythology and that consequently form the subject of classical tragedy Hermiones ominous final phrase We want no such customs here already hints at the collective fury and fear that might be launched against Andromache at Hermiones instigation Already the mechanism has been put in motion for the selection of a surrogate victim It is difficult to believe that Euripides did not know what he was doing when he framed these passages that he was unaware of the close relationship between the genesis of mythology and the collective Oedipus and the Surrogate Victim 81 mechanism he alludes to here nor can I believe that he was not attempting to issue a warning to his public to instill a sense of uneasiness without defining the problem precisely or confronting it directly We like to believe that we are well acquainted with the mechanisms of collective violence In fact we know them only in their most degenerate forms as poor imitations of the collective machinery that processed such mythological material as the story of Oedipus In the following pages violent unanimity will I believe reveal itself as the fundamental phenomenon of primitive religion although wherever it plays a crucial role it is completely or almost completely absorbed by the mythological forms it engenders We perceive only its marginal and bastardized manifestations which are unproductive as far as myths and ritual are concerned It is generally assumed that collective violencein particular the pitting of all against oneis an aberration in the history of a society a perversion more or less pathological in nature whose study can hardly be expected to yield anything of sociological significance Our rationalist bent about which I will have more to say further on leads to an innocence of outlook that refuses to concede to collective violence anything more than a limited and fleeting influence a cathartic action similar in its most extreme forms to the catharsis of the sacrificial ritual However the fact that the Oedipus myth has survived over several millenia and that modern culture continues to hold it dear would suggest that the effects of collective violence are greatly underestimated The mechanism of reciprocal violence can be described as a vicious circle Once a community enters the circle it is unable to extricate itself We can define this circle in terms of vengeance and reprisals and we can offer diverse psychological descriptions of these reactions As long as a working capital of accumulated hatred and suspicion exists at the center of the communitv it will continue to increase no matter what men do Each person prepares himself for the probable aggression of his neighbors and interprets his neighbors preparations as confirmation of the latters aggressiveness In more general terms the mimetic character of violence is so intense that once violence is installed in a community it cannot burn itself out To escape from the circle it is first necessary to remove from the scene all those forms of violence that tend to become selfpropagating and to spawn new imitative forms When a community succeeds in convincing itself that one alone ol its number is responsible for the violent mimesis besetting it when it i able to view this member as the single polluted enemy who is contaminating the rest and when the citizens are truly unanimous in thi 82 Violence and the Sacred convictionthen the belief becomes a reality for there will no longer exist elsewhere in the community a form of violence to be followed or opposed which is to say imitated and propagated In destroying the surrogate victim men believe that they are ridding themselves of some present ill And indeed they are for they are effectively doing away with those forms of violence that beguile the imagination and provoke emulation It may seem absurd to assign any practical purpose to the concept of the surrogate victim Yet we have only to substitute the word violence as it is used in these pages for the particular ills or sins that the victim is supposed to take upon himself to realize that we are indeed dealing not simply with an illusion and a mystification but with the most formidable and influential illusion and mystification in the whole range of human experience one whose consequences are real and manifold Because modern man clings to the belief that knowledge is in itself a good thing he grants litde or no importance to a procedure such as the one involving the surrogate victim that only serves to conceal the existence of mans violent impulses The optimistic falsification could well constitute the worst sort of ignorance Indeed the formidable effectiveness of the process derives from its depriving men of knowledge knowledge of the violence inherent in themselves with which they have never come to terms As Oedipus and Tiresias show us the knowledge of these violent impulses continues to expand in the course of the sacrificial crisis However far from restoring peace the knowledge only increases the antagonists awareness of the others violence thereby serving to intensify the controversy This baleful knowledge this lucidity that is only another manifestation of violence is succeeded by an allinclusive ignorance At a single blow collective violence wipes out all memory of the past Now we see why the sacrificial crisis is never described in myths and ritual as it really is There human violence is envisioned as issuing from some force exterior to man It is one with religion as well as with those forces that really do emanate from without human will death illness natural phenomena Men cannot confront the naked truth of their own violence without the risk of abandoning themselves to it entirely They have never had a very clear idea of this violence and it is possible that the survival of all human societies of the past was dependent on this fundamental lack of understanding The Oedipus myth as we have attempted to explain it in the preceding pages follows a structural pattern that conforms to that of the surrogate victim Let us now try to determine whether the pattern recurs in other myths From what we have seen it seems likely that the Oedipus and the Surrogate Victim S3 process of finding a surrogate victim constitutes a major means perhaps the sole means by which men expell from their consciousness the truth about their violent naturethat knowledge of past violence which if not shifted to a single guilty figure would poison both the present and the future The Thebansreligious believerssought a cure for their ills in a formal acceptance of the myth in making it the indisputable version of the events that had recently convulsed the city and in making it the charter for a new cultural orderby convincing themselves in short that all their miseries were due exclusively to the plague Such an attitude requires absolute faith in the guilt of the surrogate victim And the very first results the sudden restoration of peace seemed to confirm the identification of the guilty party and also the general correctness of the diagnosis The crisis is seen as a mysterious illness introduced into the community by an outsider The cure lies in ridding the community of the sole malignant element The curative process is not an illusion and if we give our attention to the matter we see that no attempt has been made to conceal that process In fact it is constantly mentioned but in a language and with a thematic content of its own derivation Naturally this process manages to encompass the oracular pronouncement reported by Creon the cure must depend on the identification and expulsion of the individual whose presence pollutes the community In other terms everybody must agree on the selection of the guilty individual The surrogate victim plays the same role on the collective level as the objects the shamans claim to extract from their patients play on the individual levelobjects that are then identified as the cause of the illness Later on in Chapter 9 we shall see that the same forces are at work in both cases but though similar the two facets of the metaphor are not equivalent The mechanism of violent unanimity is not modeled on the technique of the shamans nor is it basically metaphorical in nature on the other hand there is reason to believe that the technique of the shamans is modeled on the mechanism of unanimity interpreted in mythical fashion Parricide and incest provide the community with exactly what it needs to represent and exorcise the effects of the sacrificial crisis The myth is there to prove that we are dealing with a spontaneous process of collective selfmystification the nature of which escapes not only its direct but also its indirect beneficiariesthe Freudian psychoanalyst for instance As far as can be ascertained the operation does not make use of vulgar dissimulation or willful manipulation of the facts concerning the sacrificial crisis Because the violence is unanimously ordained it effectively restores peace and order And the false premises that it maintains acquire in consequence an impreg84 Violence and the Sacred nable authority These premises serve to hide from sight the unanimous resolution as well as the sacrificial crisis The resolution serves as the framework of the myth invisible as long as the structure remains intact There would be no themes without the structural support of the anathema The anathemas true object is not Oedipus who is only one thematic element among others but the unanimous quality of his selection which if it is to remain effective must be shielded from scrutiny protected from any outside contact or intervention This anathema still operates today in the form of neglect through our total indifference to the concept of collective violence and our refusal to attach any significance to the phenomenon even when it thrusts itself upon our attention The structure of the myth remains unshaken even today Transferring it intact into the realm of the imaginary only serves to strengthen it to render it even less susceptible to analysis No interpretation has penetrated to the core of the myth Even Freuds famous explanation of the Oedipus story the most brilliant and misleading of many failed to establish the true identity of the object being suppressed not the desire for patricide or incest but the violence that lurked behind these alltoovisible motifs the menace of total destruction that was diverted and concealed by means of the surrogate victim My hypothesis does not require that the mythological text offer a thematic treatment of condemnation or expulsion directly related to the underlying source of violence Quite the contrary The absence of this theme in certain versions of the myth by no means invalidates my theory All traces of collective violence can and may be eliminated This does not mean that the effects of the violence have been spent in fact they are stronger than ever In order for the anathema to deploy its full force it must slip from sight and from conscious memory It is not the absence of the anathema from tragedy but rather its presence that would pose a problem were it not for our belief that the tragic muse effects a partial demolition of the myth The traces of religious anathema unearthed in tragedy should be regarded not as anachronistic survivals from a primitive past but as being in the nature of an archaeological find The anathema of Oedipus the King should be viewed as part of Sophocles reading of the myth a reading perhaps more radical in its implications than we originally imagined The poet puts some very revealing words in Oedipuss mouth Quickly in the name of the gods hide me somewhere far away from here Kill me or hurl me into the sea where I will never be seen again The extent of the poets understanding of the myth and its origins is hard to ascertain but it does not have to be complete for tragedy to represent a progress in the direction of mythical dismantling The Oedipus and the Surrogate Victim 85 mechanism that produces the surrogate victim is dependent on no one particular theme because it has engendered them all it cannot be comprehended by means of a purely thematic or structural interpretation of the play     UNTIL N O W WE HAVE SEEN OEDIPUS only in terms of his polluted presence as a receptacle for universal shame And prior to the onslaught of collective violence the hero of Oedipus the King is just that Another Oedipus emerges however from the final operation a definitive Oedipus first glimpsed in the final tragedy of the Oedipus cycle Oedipus at Colonus In the opening episodes we are still dealing with the original polluted figure whose appearance within their boundaries fills the inhabitants of Colonus with dread As the play progresses however a remarkable change takes place Oedipus is still a dangerous even a terrifying figure but he has also become very precious to the community Colonus and Thebes begin to squabble over the future possession of the patricides corpse which is already looked upon as a valuable relic What has brought about this change Initially Oedipus was associated with the evil aspects of the crisis He possessed no positive qualities If his exile was a good thing it was so in a purely negative sense as the amputation of a gangrenous limb is good for an afflicted body In Oedipus at Colonus however the scope of the drama has been enlarged Having plunged the community into strife the surrogate victim restores peace and order by his departure Whereas all the previous acts of violence compounded the violence the violence directed against the surrogate victim banished all trace of violence The explanation for this extraordinary difference falls naturally within the domain of religion whose concern with the problem is far from idle since its solution touches on the wellbeing if not the survival of the community Because human thought has never succeeded in grasping the mechanism of violent unanimity it naturally turns toward the victim and seeks to determine whether he is not somehow responsible for the miraculous consequences of his own death or exile Attention is drawn not only to the distinctive traits of the decisive actthe form of the murder for examplebut also to the victims personality Because the violence directed against the victim was intended to restore order and tranquillity it seems only logical to attribute the happy result to the victim himself At the supreme moment of the crisis the very instant when reciprocal violence is abruptly transformed into unanimous violence the two faces of violence seem to be juxtaposed the extremes meet The surro86 Violence and the Sacred gate victim serves as catalyst in this metamorphosis And in performing this function he seems to combine in his person the most pernicious and most beneficial aspect of violence He becomes the incarnation as it were of a game men feign to ignore one whose basic rules are indeed unknown to them the game of their own violence2 It is not enough to say that the surrogate victim symbolizes the change from reciprocal violence and destruction to unanimous accord and construction after all the victim is directly responsible for this change and is an integral part of the process From the purely religious point of view the surrogate victimor more simply the final victim inevitably appears as a being who submits to violence without provoking a reprisal a supernatural being who sows violence to reap peace a mysterious savior who visits affliction on mankind in order subsequently to restore it to good health To our modern way of thinking a hero cannot be good without ceasing to be evil and vice versa Religious empiricism sees matters in a different light in a sense it confines itself to recording events as it sees them Oedipus is initially an evil force and subsequently a beneficial one It is not a question of exonerating him because the question of blaming him in the modern moralistic sense of the term never arises Nor for that matter does religious empiricism show any interest in initiating one of those programs of rehabilitation so fashionable today among thinkers who claim to have freed themselves from the shackles of morality The claims of religious thought are too modest too tempered by fear for its proponents to assume such lofty attitudes The mysterious union of the most evil and most beneficial forces is of vital concern to the community and can neither be challenged nor ignored Nevertheless it is a paradox that totally escapes human comprehension and religion humbly acknowledges its impotence The beneficial Oedipus at Colonus supercedes the earlier evil Oedipus but he does not negate him How could he negate him since it was the expulsion of a guilty Oedipus that prompted the departure of violence The peaceful outcome of his expulsion confirms the justice of the sentence passed on him his unanimous conviction for patricide and incest If Oedipus is indeed the savior of the community it is because he is a patricidal and incestuous son Sophocles two Oedipus tragedies show a pattern of transgression and salvation long familiar to scholars Such a pattern is to be found in 2 We will see further on that this phenomenon of the transformation of secular into sacred elements is facilitated by hallucinatory effects that are basic to the primordial religious experience However it is not essential to have experienced these effects to grasp the main principles of primitive religious systems The logic of such systems is now open to view Oedipus and the Surrogate Victim 81 innumerable tales from folklore and mythology in fairy stories legends and even in works of literature A source of violence and disorder during his sojourn among men the hero appears as a redeemer as soon as he has been eliminated invariably by violent means It also happens that the hero while remaining a transgressor is cast primarily as a destroyer of monsters Oedipus appears in this role in the episode of the Sphinx The Sphinx plays a role similar to that of the plague terrorizing all Thebes and demanding a periodic tribute of victims We must now inquire whether the explanation I have proposed for the principal episode of the Oedipus myth is equally applicable to similar mythological tales in other words whether we are in each instance dealing with a different manifestation of the surrogate victim Indeed in all such myths the hero draws to himself a violent reaction whose effects are felt throughout the community He unwittingly conjures up a baleful infectious force that his own deathor triumph transforms into a guarantee of order and tranquillity The plague motif is only one of many that could serve equally well to conceal the presence of the sacrificial crisis and its violent outcome For example there are stories of collective salvation in which the death of a single victim serves to appease the anger of some god or spirit A lone individual who may or may not have been guilty of some past crime is offered up to a ferocious monster or demon in order to appease him and he ends up killing that monster as he is killed by him The functioning of the surrogate victim explains the principal motifs of the Oedipus myth and illuminates the genesis and structure of these motifs Moreover I believe that this same process serves to explain a great many other myths so many in fact that we cannot help wondering whether it might not be the structural mold of all mythology Nor do my speculations stop here If the generating spark of religion itself and the transcendental force that characterizes it are in fact the product of violent unanimityof social unity forged or reforged by the expulsion of the surrogate victimthen even more momentous matters are at issue If this is indeed the case we will find ourselves dealing not only with myths but also with rituals and the whole question of religion At present I have done little more than oudine a hypothesis some of whose elements are still lacking In the chapters to come I hope to fill out this theory to make clear what must now of necessity seem somewhat obscure The first task however is to examine the basis of my hypothesis and attempt to situate it in the context of contemporary thought 88 Violence and the Sacred Even at this stage it is apparent 1 believe that the hypothesis casts light on certain passages in mythological literature Heraclitus who has been called the philosopher of tragedy and who has equal claim to the title philosopher of myth seems to have been on the track of the same structuring force I am now pursuing Perhaps I anticipate but I cannot refrain from mentioning that certain fragments of Heraclitus until now mute and indecipherable suddenly assume an obvious meaning in the light of my hypothesis Does not Fragment 60 display a clear summation of the origins of myth of the role of violence in the engendering of the gods and of distinctions Does it not oflFer a resume of all the questions that have been addressed in this chapter Strife is the father and king of all Some it makes gods others men some slaves and others free 5a3 Chapter Four The Origins of Myth and Ritual efjurll I N T H E STUDY OF PRIMITIVE RELIGION two   W J theories have long held sway The older attributes the origins of ritual to myth seeking in the mythological construct either some real event grounded in historical fact or a specific belief that gave birth to ritualistic practices The more recent theory reverses the procedure attributing to ritual not only the origin of myth but also the origin of the gods andin Greeceof tragedy and other cultural forms as well Hubert and Mauss belong to the latter school of thought In sacrifice they see the genesis of the gods The repetition of these ceremonies in which either by custom or for any other reason an identical victim reappears at regular intervals ends by creating a sort of personality The accumulation of past sacrifices thus culminates in the creation of a god while the individual rite preserves its secondary effects1 Sacrifice is here visualized as engendering religion This means of course that we cannot expect to learn anything about the origin of sacrifice itself from Hubert and Mauss for when a phenomenon is used to explain other phenomena it can generally be assumed that no explanation of the explanatory phenomenon will be forthcoming The latter becomes a kind of unformulated dogma to be accepted on pure faith Whatever makes other things clear does not need apparently to be made clear itself Hubert and Mauss have nothing to say about the origins of sacrificial practice and very little about its nature and function even though their discussion is entitled Sacrifice Its Nature and Function As we have already seen the notion that sacrifice serves primarily to bring us into contact with the gods makes little sense For even if the gods are imaged forth at the conclusion of a long series of sacrifices what are we to make of the preliminary rounds What were the sacrificers thinking about at a time when they did not yet possess gods with 1 Hubert and Mauss Sacrifice p 81 90 Violence and the Sacred whom to communicate Whyfor whomwere those rites performed under the vast celestial void The passion that prompts modern antitheists to shift all blame onto the godsv must not lead us astray Sacrifice deals with humankind and it is in human terms that we must attempt to comprehend it Hubert and Mausss failure to come to grips with the origin and function of sacrifice makes their accurate description of its operation even more remarkable One cannot attribute this accuracy to some a priori concept for sacrifice still awaits its proper interpretation The resemblances among the rites practiced in disparate cultures are striking and the variations from one culture to another are never sufficient to disguise the basic similarities Hubert and Mauss can thus feel justified in describing the sacrificial process outside the context of any specific culture as if it were some kind of technique And a technique it truly is but does this technique as these two authors contend have no real object and serve no function in the social process How can an institution that is ultimately judged fantastical and imaginary manifest such remarkable similarities from culture to culture It is no longer a question of appealing to diffusionist theories they had already been discredited and with good reason at the time Hubert and Mauss were writing The more one reflects on these structural similarities the more one is tempted to qualify them as not merely surprising but dowrnright miraculous And while admiring the descriptive powers of Hubert and Mauss one cannot help wishing they shared that irrepressible inquisitiveness that characterized some of their predecessors Yet it was undoubtedly necessary to set aside a great many problems in order to schematize certain forms of analysisand that is precisely what these two authors did Undoubtedly a provisional limiting of the field of study serves to bring into relief certain areas that had previously been neglected and misunderstood In scientific research as in warfare it is always prudentfor the sake of moraleto represent strategic retreats in a positive light All the same workers in the field must take care not to mistake these retreats for glorious victories In all the social sciences today the tendencies apparent in the work of Hubert and Mauss seem to have swept the field It is no longer a question of relating ritual to myth or even myth to ritual Such procedures invariably produced a circular train of argument from which the only means of escape seemed to lie in designating some arbitrary point of departure It is good that this futile mode of thought has been abandoned Another positive development is the recognition that if a solution to the problem exists it exists at the center of the circle not on the periphery What is decidedly not good The Origins of Myth and Ritual 91 is the conclusion that either this center is totally inaccessible or there is no center at all Such pessimistic suppositions based on past failures purport to be ultrascientific but are in fact questions of philosophy and temperament Past failures prove nothing outside their own context It is foolhardy to condemn the search for a real origin simply because the search has not been successful so far Antimetaphysical speculation is after all another form of metaphysics At any moment a new theory may arise that will provide a satisfactorythat is a scientificanswer to the question of the origins nature and function not onlv of sacrifice but also of religion in general It is not enough to declare certain problems null and void after a cursory and purely symbolic investigation in order to lay claim to a scientific approach Science is not a refuge for philosophic skepticism a pose of sage resignation All great discoveries begin with a sense of curiositv that is todav often dismissed as childish and a faith in the resources of language even the most commonplace language that is often condemned as naive When the nil admixari of those bourgeois dandys caricatured by Stendhal passes for the last word in understanding we have just cause for alarm The relative failure of Frazer Freud or Robertson Smith is no reason to regard their insistence on getting to the bottom of things as foolish or outdated To assert that there is nothing to be gained by seeking out the function and origin of ritual is to say that the language of religion is destined to remain forever a dead letter a kind of gibberishcleverly codified perhaps but devoid of any real meaning From time to time a voice is heard calling our attention to the very strangeness of institutions such as sacrifice and attempting to satisfy our deep need to find a firm basis in reality for these institutions Adolphe Jensen for one managed to reopen the great inquiries of the pastand it is perhaps for that very reason that his work has received so litde notice from contemporary scholars Jensen writes Man must have been subjected to some particularly overwhelming experiences to have been led to introduce such cruel practices into his life What could have been the reasons What could have persuaded men to kill their fellowbeingsnot in the wanton amoral manner of barbarians succumbing to their instincts but as a reflex of the awakened consciousness of the creator of cultural forms seeking to comprehend the innermost nature of the world and to transmit this knowledge to future generations by means of dramatic representations    iMythological thought always returns to what happened initially to the act of creation justly assuming that this occurrence sheds the brightest most revealing light on a given subject    92 Violence and the Sacred If murder plays such a decisive role in the sacrificial rite this means that it must have played a particularly important part in the initial impulse2 I do not deny the utility of recent descriptive contributions But I believe the time has come for us to ask ourselves once again whether something of vital importance did indeed take place imtially We must return to the traditional questions reframing them in terms of the rigorous methodology of our own times Once we have determined the underlying principle of our search we should consider the a priori conditions that any theory must fulfill to command our scrutiny If sacrifice has a real origin the memory of which myths keep alive in one way and rituals commemorate in another then it seems clear that wre are dealing with an event that initially made a very strong impression Very strong but not unforgettablefor in the end it is forgotten But this impression although subject to later modification lives on in the religious observances and perhaps in all the cultural manifestations of the society There is no need to postulate some form of individual or collective subconscious to account for its survival The extraordinary number of commemorative rites that have to do with killing leads us to imagine that the original event must have been a murder Freud in Totem and Taboo lucidly perceived this necessity And the remarkable similarities among the sacrificial rites of various localities suggest that the murder was always of the same general type This does not mean that the murder was a single historical event or that it belongs exclusively to prehistory Although the event looks exceptional from the perspective of any given society it seems quite commonplace in a broad comparative context The sacrificial crisis and the surrogatevictim mechanism fulfill all the conditions required of a satisfactory hypothesis But it may be protested if such an event had actually taken place science would already have discovered it This assertion fails to take into account an extraordinary deficiency of modern science The presence of a religious element at the source of all human societies is indubitable yet of all social institutions religion is the only one to which science has been unable to attribute a genuine objective a real function I contend that the objective of ritual is the proper reenactment of the surrogatevictim mechanism its function is to perpetuate or renew the effects of this mechanism that is to keep violence outside the community 2Adolphe E Jensen Mytbes et cultes chez les peuples prhnitifs Paris 1954 pp 20W The Origins of Myth and Ritual 93 QJ4 I BEGAN BY REMARKING on the cathartic function of sacrifice and went on to define the sacrificial crisis as the loss of this function as well as of all cultural distinctions If the unanimous violence directed against the surrogate victim succeeds in bringing this crisis to an end clearly this violence must be at the origin of a new sacrificial system If the surrogate victim can interrupt the destructuring process it must be at the origin of structure We shall see further on whether it is possible to verify this assertion with regard to those rites and regulations that are essential to a cultural orderfestivals rites of passage proscriptions against incest etc At present we have good reason to believe that the violence directed against the surrogate victim might well be radically generative in that by putting an end to the vicious and destructive cycle of violence it simultaneously initiates another and constructive cycle that of the sacrificial ritewhich protects the community from that same violence and allows culture to flourish If this is true the generative violence constitutes at least the indirect origin of all those things that men hold most dear and that they strive most ardently to preserve This notion is affirmed though in a veiled and transfigured manner by the many etiological myths that deal with the murder of one mythological character by other mythological characters That event is conceived as the origin of the cultural order the dead divinity becomes the source not only of sacred rites but also of matrimonial regulations and proscriptions of every kind in short of all those cultural forms that give man his unique humanity In some cases the mythological characters are said to grant men whatever they need to live in society in other cases they deny them these same benefits In either case men manage to obtain what they require sometimes by theft or trickery but not before one of the mythological characters has been isolated from the others and subjected to some unusual accident or misfortune This accident may be fatal sometimes it is merely ludicrous We must recognize in it a mask of the collective violence that terminates the crisis Sometimes the central figure breaks away from the group and flees taking with him the object in dispute Generally he is overtaken and put to death occasionally he is merely wounded or beaten Sometimes it is he who demands to be beaten and at each blow extraordinary benefits accrue giving rise to a fertility and an abundance that assures the harmonious functioning of the cultural order The mythical narrative sometimes takes the form of a contest or game a quasisportive or pugilistic event that evokes the rivalries inherent in the sacrificial crisis Behind all these themes one can detect 94 Violence and the Sacred the outline of reciprocal violence gradually transformed into a unanimous act It is certainly astonishing that all human activities and even the course of nature itself are subordinated to this metamorphosis of violence taking place at the heart of the community When relationships between men are troubled when men cease to cooperate among themselves and to come to terms with one another there is no human enterprise that does not suffer Even the success of the hunt of fishing expeditions of food gathering is put in question Therefore the benefits attributed to the generative violence extend beyond mankind to nature itself The act of collective murder is seen as the source of all abundance the principle of procreation is attributed to it and all those plants that are useful to man everything beneficial and nutritive is said to take root in the body of the primordial victim Even Hubert and Mauss cite facts that should serve to bring socially aware investigators into direct contact with social realities Side by side with myths in which the element of generative mob action is barely discernible there exist others in which its presence is explicitly acknowledged Such transparent myths are by no means confined to those cultures we Western humanists might be tempted to qualify as primitive or crude Hubert and Mauss offer an exemplary specimen from Greece At Troezen in the peribolos of the temple of Hippolytos the death of the foreign goddesses Damia and Auxesia was commemorated by an annual festival the lithobolia According to tradition the two virgin goddesses from Crete were stoned to death in the course of an uprising These foreigners represent the foreigner the passerby who often plays a role in the harvest festivals and the lapidation is a sacrificial rite3 Associated with the Oedipus myth are rites like those involving the pharmakos whose true significance becomes clear in the light of the above comments The city of Athens prudently kept on hand a number of unfortunate souls whom it maintained at public expense for appointed times as well as in certain emergencies Whenever some calamity threatenedplague famine foreign invasion or internal dissensionthere was always a pharmakos at the disposal of the communitv The complete explanation of the Oedipus myththat is the determining of the precise function of the surrogate victimpermits us to understand the aim of the sacrificers They are striving to produce a replica as faithful as possible in every detail of a previous crisis that was resolved by means of a spontaneously unanimous victimization All the dangers real and imaginary that threaten the community are sub3 Hubert and Mauss Sacrifice p 83 The Origins of Myth and Ritual 95 sumed in the most terrible danger that can confront a society the sacrificial crisis The rite is therefore a repetition of the original spontaneous lynching that restored order in the community by reestablishing around the figure of the surrogate victim that sentiment of social accord that had been destroyed in the onslaught of reciprocal violence Like Oedipus the victim is considered a polluted object whose living presence contaminates everything that comes in contact with it and whose death purges the community of its illsas the subsequent restoration of public tranquillity clearly testifies That is why the pharmakos was paraded about the city He was used as a kind of sponge to sop up impurities and afterward he was expelled from the community or killed in a ceremony that involved the entire populace If my thesis is correct the pharmakos like Oedipus himself has a dual connotation On the one hand he is a woebegone figure an object of scorn who is also weighed down with guilt a butt for all sorts of gibes insults and of course outbursts of violence On the other hand we find him surrounded by a quasireligious aura of veneration he has become a sort of cult object This duality reflects the metamorphosis the ritual victim is designed to effect the victim draws to itself all the violence infecting the original victim and through its own death transforms this baneful violence into beneficial violence into harmony and abundance It is not surprising that the word pharmakon in classical Greek means both poison and the antidote for poison both sickness and cure in short any substance capable of perpetrating a very good or very bad action according to the circumstances and the dosage The pharmakon is thus a magic drug or volatile elixir whose administration had best be left by ordinary men in the hands of those who enjoy special knowledge and exceptional powerspriests magicians shamans doctors and so on4 The comparison of Oedipus and the pharmakos is not meant to imply that we accept the views of certain scholars most notably the earlytwentiethcentury Cambridge Ritualists who have proposed a purely ritualistic interpretation of tragedy It is evident that the Oedipus myth is intimately associated with rites analogous to those involving the pharmakos but we must take care not to confuse the myth and ritual on the one hand with the essentially antimythical and antiritualistic inspiration of the drama on the other The Cambridge Ritualists and their disciples have based their interpretation of the role of the pharmakos on the idea that seasonal changethe death and resurrection of natureconstitutes the original model for the rite its deep Cf Chapter 11 pp 29697 96 Violence and the Sacred seated meaning In fact there is nothing in nature that could encourage or even suggest such an atrocious sort of ritual killing as the death of the pharmakos In my opinion the sole possible model remains the sacrificial crisis and its resolution Nature enters the picture later when the ritualistic mind succeeds in detecting certain similarities between natures rhythms and the communitys alternating pattern of order and disorder The modus operandi of violencesometimes reciprocal and pernicious sometimes unanimous and beneficialis then taken as the model for the entire universe To portray tragedy as a repetition and an adaptation of the seasonal rites a sort of sacre du printemps is surely to strip it of those very elements that mark it as tragedy This remains true even if it is correct ultimately to confer on tragedy a quasiritualistic value in Western culture Frazer and the Cambridge Ritualists center their interpretation on seasonal and agricultural connotations that do play an important role in many festivals but that are ultimately derived like all other connotations from the victimization mechanism The connection between the drama and the major mythological themes is undeniable but in order to grasp its full significance we must transcend the approach that limits itself to thematic analysis and renounce those prejudices that might lead us to portray the scapegoat purely as a product of blind superstition a nonfunctional device bereft of any operative value In the scapegoat theme we should recognize the very real metamorphosis of reciprocal violence into restraining violence through the agency of unanimitr This unique mechanism structures all cultural values even as it conceals itself behind them it is associated even more fundamentally with the doubleedged images of myths and rituals Sophocles appends nothing to the scapegoat theme its broader meaning is not simply tacked on nor has the tragic poet on his own initiative turned Oedipus into a reflection of the human condition Scapegoat effects are more deeply rooted in the human condition than we are willing to admit5 My hypothesis is becoming at once broader and more precise It should permit us to see through certain previously impenetrable reli5 A number of French scholars have detected in the Oedipus of both myth and tragedy a pharmakos and a scapegoat According to Marie Delcourt the institution of the scapegoat explains the fate of the infant Oedipus abandoned by his parents Oedipus is offered as a scapegoat by a father called Laius that is to say Publius the representative of the people The murder by exposure of weak or illformed infants was extremely widespread and is certainly associated with the concept of the surrogate victimthat is with the unanimous basis of all sacrificial rites It is the indication of that unanimity among the general populace that Marie Delcourt has touched upon here Legendes et cultes de keros en Grece Paris 1942 p 102 Cf also her Oedipe et la legende du conquerant Paris 1944 The Origins of Myth and Ritual 91 gious acts such as the execution of the pharmakos and to discern their perfectly intelligible aims As we will soon discover this same hypothesis pertains not only to rites as a general category but also to their most minute details Hitherto I have examined only those sacrifices that involve human victims The link between the rite and the functioning of violent unanimity is especially apparent when the original victim also happens to have been a human being In such instances the effort at imitation is easy to discern We should now ask ourselves whether animal sacrifices too cannot be defined as the mimesis of an initial collective murder In my first chapter I suggested that there was no essential difference between human and animal sacrifice If this is true the origin of all sacrifices must be the same The celebrated Judaic scapegoat and all animal rites of the same type lend strong support to my hypothesis But there is surely no harm in pausing a moment longer to examine a classical case of animal sacrifice in order to demonstrate if possible its direct connection with the execution of a surrogate victim If it can be shown that the sacrificial rites are indeed striving to reproduce the mechanism of violent unanimity and that the surrogate victim is indeed the key to all these rites considerable new light will be shed on the matter of animal sacrifice Let us turn our attention to one of those rare societies in which sacrifice survives to this day as a living institution and whose customs have been diligently recorded by a trained ethnologist In Divinity and Experience Godfrey Lienhardt describes in detail several sacrificial ceremonies that he witnessed among the Dinka I will summarize the general substance of his descriptions taking care to emphasize those points that seem especially significant The insistent rhythm of choral incantations gradually captures the attention of a crowd of bystanders who at first appeared scattered and selfabsorbed Participants begin to brandish weapons in mock warfare A few isolated individuals strike out at others but without any real hostility In these preparatory stages violence is therefore already present in a ritual form but it is still manifestly reciprocal the ritualistic imitation deals first with the sacrificial crisis itself with the chaotic antecedents to the unanimous resolution From time to time somebody detaches himself from the group to beat the cow or calf that has been More recently JeanPierre Vernant has taken up these ideas and exploits some of their possibilities in his thematic analysis of Oedipus the King Divine ruler and pharmakos these are the two faces of Oedipus It is this duality that accounts for his enigmatic aspect that unites in him like an ambiguous phrase two inverse images superimposed one upon the other To this inversion in Oedipuss nature Sophocles appends a broader meaning the hero as a reflection of the human condition Vernant Ambiguite et renversement p 1271 98 Violence and the Sacred tied to a nearby stake or to hurl insults at it There is nothing static or stilted about the performance it succeeds in giving shape to a collective impulse that gradually triumphs over the forces of dispersion and discord by bringing corporate violence to bear on a ritual victim In this rite the metamorphosis of reciprocal violence into unilateral violence is explicitly and dramatically reenacted And it seems to me that the same can be seen to hold true for an infinite number of rites if one keeps a sharp eye out for signs often admittedly fragmentary and elusive that reveal the functioning of this particular metamorphosis In the oftencited example of the Greek Bouphonia the participants make a point of quarreling among themselves before turning their attention to the designated victim 11 the mock battles that generally take place prior to sacrificial ceremonies and all the ritual dances whose formal symmetry is reflected in a perpetual confrontation between the performers lend themselves to an interpretation in which the performances are seen as imitative responses to a sacrificial crisis In the Dinka sacrifice it seems that the paroxysm takes place not at the death of the victim but in the course of the ritual curses pronounced before its death One gets the impression that these curses are in themselves able to destroy the victim that it is as in tragedy for all practical purposes killed by words And these words even if they are not firmly fixed by custom are fundamentally identical to the accusations hurled by Tiresias against Oedipus The actual execution sometimes consists of a veritable stampede of the entire group directed against the victim In this case it is the victims genitals that are singled out The same is true of the pharmakos who is whipped on his sexual organs with herbaceous plants There is thus some reason to believe that the animal victim is a standin for an original victim accused like Oedipus of patricide incest or of some other sexual transgression that signifies the violent abolition of distinctionsthe major cause of cultural disintegration The means of dispatching the victim may vary depending on the nature of the crime but the death sentence itself remains invariable The ritualistic mentality imagines that this death will result in benefits too great to be ascribed to a simple punitive measure These benefits must be real But the ritualistic mentality does not understand why they have accrued the only explanations it can offer are mythic However this same mentality has a good notion of how these benefits are obtained and it tries unceasingly to repeat the fruitful process The scorn hostility and cruelty displayed toward the animal prior to the ritualistic slaughter are replaced upon its death by a show of ritualistic veneration In bearing away into death the scourge of reciprocal violence the victim has performed its assigned function The Origins of Myth and Ritual 99 Henceforth the victim will incarnate violence in both its guises beneficial and baneful that is it will personify the AllPowerful who rules from on high Having been so flagrantly abused it is only reasonable that the victim should be greatly honoredjust as it was reasonable to banish Oedipus when he seemed the bearer of ill fortune and reasonable to honor him when his departure assured the communitys wellbeing That adopting the former attitude assures the latter result seems to confirm the rationality of the plan despite its contradictory appearance Lienhardt himself defines the victim as a scapegoat who becomes the receptacle of human passions We are dealing here with an animal pharmakos a calf or cow that assumes not some vague and illdefined sins but the very real though often hidden hostilities that all the members of the community feel for one another Our portrayal of sacrifice as an imitation and reenactment of spontaneous collective violence in no way conflicts with the definition I proposed in Chapter 1 In fact spontaneous violence contains an element of appeasement that can also be found in ritual sacrifice though in diluted form In the original event it is unleashed violence that is checked and at the same time partially appeased in the ritual reenactment it is the more or less latent aggressions that are dealt with The community is both attracted and repelled by its own origins It feels the constant need to reexperience them albeit in veiled and transfigured form By means of rites the community manages to cajole and somewhat subdue the forces of destruction But the true nature and real function of these forces will always elude its grasp precisely because the source of the evil is the community itself The only way in which the ritualistic imagination can succeed in its selfappointed task a task both painstaking and elusiveis by allowing violence a certain amount of free play as in the original instance but not too much that is by exercising its memory of the collective expulsion on carefully designated objects and within a rigorous framework In societies where sacrifice is still a living institution it displays the cathartic function I attributed to it in my first chapter The catharsis is performed in a structural setting so strikingly similar to that of unanimous violence that one can only conclude that it is a deliberate if not an entirely exact imitation of unanimous violence X A N Y THESIS THAT MAINTAINS that ritual is the imitation and reenactment of spontaneous unanimous violence may well seem fanciful even fantastic as long as one considers a few isolated rites But when one widens the scope of the inquiry supporting evidence appears at every turn Seen from a broad perspective certain 100 Violence and the Sacred mythological and ritualistic analogies previous overlooked leap into view Even a cursory examination reveals that the theme of unanimity recurs with extraordinary frequency in all aspects of religious life in rituals and in myths It recurs in cultures so far apart in forms so disparate and in texts so diverse in nature that it is impossible to explain it away through some diffusionist theory As noted above the Dinka sacrificial execution often takes the form of a stampede of young men who trample the beast down and crush him by their sheer mass When the animal is too large to be killed in this way he is slaughtered in a more conventional manner but a simulated stampede is still performed as a prelude to the slaughter The sacrificial ceremony requires a show of collective participation if only in purely symbolic form This association of the collectivity with the killing of the sacrificial victim is found in numerous instancesnotably in the Dionysiac sparagmos which I will discuss later on6 All the participants without exception are required to take part in the death scene The same is true for the Arabian camel sacrifice described in Robertson Smiths Religion of the Semites and for a good many other sacrificial rituals It is a unanimous group that Odysseus and his companions plunge the redhot stake into the Cyclops eye It is as a unanimous group that the gods of some of the generative myths conspire and bring about the death of one of their divine colleagues In Hindu mythology the same motif recurs The YadjonrVeda speaks of a sacrificial ceremony in which a god Soma is to be put to death by the other gods Mithra at first refuses to join his divine companions in the act but he is finally persuaded to do so by the argument that the sacrifice will be totally ineffective if not performed by all This myth offers a prescription for the correct performance of a sacrifice Unanimity is a formal requirement the abstention of a single participant renders the sacrifice even worse than uselessit make it dangerous In the story of the murder of Hainuwele mythological heroine of the Ceram Islanders the sacrificers stamp on her grave in a manner that emphatically underlines the unanimous and collective character of the enterprise The signs of unanimity displayed in some local myth can reappear in identical form in a ritual peformed by some other community For example the NgadjuDayaks of Borneo first sacrifice slaves then perform a burial rite that involves all the participants stamping on the graves In fact the NgadjuDayaks demand total participation in all their sacrificial rites The long drawn out agony of the  Cf Chapter 5 131 The Origins of Myth and Ritual 101 slaves execution yields nothing to psychological explanations What counts is the communal gesture of unanimity therefore all the participants in the sacrifice are required to strike the victim before its death The ritualistic structure of the ceremony is strictly regulated and reflects the hierarchical distinctions that govern the cultural order Animal sacrifices are performed in the same manner7 Even in a society such as the Kaingang wracked by reciprocal violence the demand for unanimity reappears in bastard form The murderers never wanted to act alone They insisted on the collaboration of the members of the group To demand that the final blow be delivered by someone else is the usual practice at Kaingang murders8 There is no question of denying the psychological significance of such accounts quite the contrary In the absence of any collective structuralization our only recourse is the psychological interpretation No ritual context is available evil violence runs wild k THE FUNCTION OF SACRIFICE as defined in Chapter 1 not only allows for but requires a surrogate victimin other words violent unanimity In ritual sacrifice the victim when actually put to death diverts violence from its forbidden objectives within the community But for whom precisely is this victim substituted Heretofore we could only conceive of this substitution in terms of individual psychological mechanisms which clearly do not provide an adequate picture of the process If there were no surrogate victim to transform the sacrifice from an essentially private concern into one involving the whole community we would be obliged to regard the victim as a substitute for particular individuals who have somehow provoked the sacrificed anger If the transfer is purely personal as it is in psychoanalysis then sacrifice cannot be a true social institution involving the entire community But sacrifice as we know is essentially a communal institution Individualization marks a later decadent stage in its evolution a development contrary to its original spirit To understand how and why sacrifice functions as it does we should consider the proposition that the ritual victim is never substituted for some particular member of the community or even for the community as a whole it is always substituted for the surrogate victim As this victim itself serves as a substitute for all the members of the community the sacrificial substitution does indeed play the role that we 7 H Sharer Die Bedeutung des Menschenopfers im Dagakischen Toten Kult Mitteilungen der deutschen Gesellschaft fur Volkerkunde 10 1940 Cited by Jensen Mythes ex cultes chez les peuples prhnitifs p 198 8 Jules Henry Jungle People New York 1964 p 123 102 Violence and the Sacred have attributed to it protecting all the members of the community from their respective violencebut always through the intermediary of the surrogate victim This observation should clear me of any suspicion of psychologizing while eliminating a serious objection to basing the present theory on sacrificial substitution If the entire community were not already subsumed under a single head that of the surrogate victim it would be impossible to attribute to the sacrificial substitution the significance we have claimed for it impossible to establish a social basis for the institution The original act of violence is unique and spontaneous Ritual sacrifices however are multiple endlessly repeated All those aspects of the original act that had escaped mans controlthe choice of time and place the selection of the victimare now premeditated and fixed by custom The ritual process aims at removing all element of chance and seeks to extract from the original violence some technique of cathartic appeasement The diluted force of the sacrificial ritual cannot be attributed to imperfections in its imitative technique After all the rite is designed to function during periods of relative calm as we have seen its role is not curative but preventive If it were more effective than it in fact isif it did not limit itself to appropriate sacrificial victims but instead like the original act of violence vented its force on a participating member of the communitythen it would lose all effectiveness for it would bring to pass the very thing it was supposed to prevent a relapse into the sacrificial crisis The sacrificial process is as fully adapted to its normal function as collective murder is to its abnormal and normative function There is every reason to believe that the minor catharsis of the sacrificial act is derived from that major catharsis circumscribed by collective murder Ritual sacrifice is founded on a double substitution The first which passes unperceived is the substitution of one member of the community for all brought about through the operation of the surrogate victim The second the only truly ritualistic substitution is superimposed on the first It is the substitution of a victim belonging to a predetermined sacrificial category for the original victim The surrogate victim comes from inside the community and the ritual victim must come from outside otherwise the community might find it difficult to unite against it How it may be asked does the second substitution graft itself onto the first How does the original violence succeed in imposing a centrifugal force on the rite In short how does the sacrificial technique operate I will attempt to return to these questions but at this point I wish to draw attention to the essentially mimetic character of sacrifice The Origins of Myth and Ritual 103 with regard to the original generative act of violence Thanks to this mimetic aspect we can understand how the sacrificial process can exist and function without being obliged to attribute to the ritualistic mind a manipulative ability or a clairvoyance that it most certainly does not possess It is entirely possible to regard the sacrificial rite as a commemoration of a real event without reducing it to the triviality of one of our own national holidays or for that matter without ascribing it to some neurotic compulsion as psychoanalysts are wont to do A trace of very real violence persists in the rite and there is no doubt that the rite succeeds at least partially because of its grim associations its lingering fascination but its essential orientation is peaceful Even the most violent rites are specifically designed to abolish violence To see these rites as expressions of mans pathological morbidity is to miss the point It goes without saying that the rite has its violent aspects but these always involve a lesser violence proffered as a bulwark against a far more virulent violence Moreover the rite aims at the most profound state of peace known to any community the peace that follows the sacrificial crisis and results from the unanimous accord generated by the surrogate victim To banish the evil emanations that accumulate within the community and to recapture the freshness of this original experience are one and the same task Whether order reigns supreme or whether its reign is already challenged the same model the same plan of action is invariablv proposed It is the plan associated with the victorious resolution of all communal crises that involves violence against the surrogate victim e4 WE ARE EVOLVING A THEORY of myth and ritual in short of religion as a whole Up to this point the analyses of the crucial role attributed to the surrogate victim and to unanimous violence may have appeared too summary too incomplete for this theory to seem much more than a working hypothesis At this stage of our exposition we can hardly hope to have banished all the readers doubts A thesis that attributes a real origin to religion demands the abandonment of too many currently accepted ideas and the rethinking of too many fundamental concepts to be readily accepted expecially when it is not susceptible to direct verification If ritual imitation no longer recalls precisely what it is imitating if the secret of the primordial event has been allowed to slip from its memory then the rite involves a form of delusion that has never subsequently been understood No single rite will reproduce point for point the operations my hypothesis proposes as the origin of all rites A delusion concerning its own factual basisnot the absence of that basisis characteristic of 104 Violence and the Sacred religion And the source of this delusion is none other than the surrogate victim or rather the fact which remains unperceived that the surrogate victim is arbitrarily chosen The ritualistic mind strives to reproduce the operation of violent unanimity without understanding its mimetic nature If my hypothesis is correct no single religious form will suffice to illuminate the whole picture but a multiplicity of examples will cast light on its various aspects until everything gradually becomes clear and certainty prevails In order to verify my hypothesis then it must be applied to many different forms of ritual and myth as far apart in content history and geography as possible If it is correct the complex rites will provide the most striking confirmation The more complex a system the more numerous will be the elements it strives to reproduce in the operation analyzed above As most of these elements are in principle already in our possession the most difficult problems should resolve themselves of their own accord The scattered fragments of the system should cohere and the unintelligible become intelligible The sacred monarchies of continental Africa have long resisted all attempts at analysis In discussing the complexity of their structures scholars have had recourse to such adjectives as strange and aberrant In an era when it was still believed possible to classify all rituals under more or less logical headings the African rites were generally grouped under the rubric Exceptions In one important group situated between Egypt and Swaziland the king is required to commit an act of incest either real or symbolic on certain solemn occasionsnotablv at his enthronement or in the course of the periodic rites of renewal Among the kings possible partners are virtually all the women formally forbidden him by matrimonial regulations mother sisters daughters nieces cousins etc Sometimes the parentage is real sometimes classificatory In societies where the incestuous act is no longer actually consummatedif indeed it ever wasa symbolism of incest persists As Luc de Heusch has pointed out the important role played by the queen mother in these societies can only be understood in the context of ritual incest9 In order to understand royal incest we must take care not to wrench it from its context as is too often done by writers captivated by its sensational aspects This rite forms part of an overall ritualistic procedure that prescribes the other transgressions the king must commit before he takes office For example he must eat certain forbidden foods and commit certain acts of violence In some instances he is literally bathed in blood and fed concoctions whose ingredients 9 Luc de Heusch Essai ntr le symbolisme de Vinceste royal en Afrique Brussels 1958 The Origins of Myth and Ritual 105 bloody offal and refuse of all kinds indicate their evil character In some societies the whole enthronement ceremony takes place in an atmosphere of bloodstained confusion It is not a question then of one particular forbidden act or of one act being particularly forbidden On occasion the king is required to commit all the forbidden acts that are imaginable and possible for him to commit The encyclopedic character of the transgressions as well as the eclectic nature of the incestuous act betray who it is that the king is supposed to incarnate the paragon of transgressors the man who holds nothing sacred and who fearlessly assumes every form of hubris We are not dealing here with royal peccadilloes in the class let us say of Louis XIVs mistressesobjects of amused forebearance perhaps but accorded no official position by the community The African peoples close their eyes to nothing in fact they keep them wide open and incest in their judgment often constitutes the sine qua non of accession to the throne That is not to say that such infractions are no longer considered reprehensible when committed by a king On the contrary it is because of their ability to remain reprehensible that these infractions are selected These acts bestow on the king a particularly potent form of pollution which is repeatedly alluded to in the symbolic imagery of the ceremonies Among the Bushongs for example where rats are regarded as nyec disgusting and held as taboo the king is formally presented at his coronation with a basket full of these rodents10 The theme of the leperking is sometimes associated with this same ceremony the new king is proclaimed the descendant and heir of a royal leper who was the first to occupy the throne11 The cultures that practice royal incest sometimes offer an interpretation of it that cannot be taken seriously It is asserted that the king chooses a wife from among his close relatives in order to preserve the purity of the royal blood This explanation will not do Clearly the incest as well as the other forbidden acts are designed to make the king the very incarnation of impurity It is because of this impurity that the king in the course of the enthronement and renewal ceremonies is subjected to the ritualistic insults and abuse of his people A hostile crowd denounces the misconduct of this miscreant who is as yet nothing more than a criminal and a social outcast In some instances the royal army stages a mock attack on the kings personal bodyguard and even on the king himself If one chooses to make a criminal of ones king and requires him to violate the most sacred laws in particular the laws of exogamy it i J Vansina

Sacred cannot be for the pleasure of pardoning him or of displaying ones generosity of spirit On the contrary all this takes place because punishment of the severest sort seems to be in order and the needful insults and hostilities find their outlet in sacrificial ceremonies in which the king plays the chief rolethe role of the original victim I have insisted on the need to view royal incest in its proper ritual context This context is not limited to the act itself it appears also to include the real or symbolic sacrifice of the monarch And the sacrifice of the king is clearly a punishment for his transgressions The idea that the king is sacrificed because he has lost his strength or virility is as fanciful as the theory that royal incest preserves the purity of the family strain Both theories are tardy afterthoughts designed to supply an ideological basis for the rites Few ethnologists take them seriously and ethnological evidence offers good reason to doubt them In Ruanda for example the king and the queen motherclearly an incestuous couplemust periodically submit to a sacrificial rite that can only be regarded as a symbolic punishment for incest The royal pair appeared in public bound like captives condemned to death A bull and a cow their substitutes were clubbed to the ground and slaughtered The king then mounted the flanks of the bull and some of the bulls blood was poured over him so as to carry the symbolic resemblance between the two as far as possible12 It should now be clear what scenario the king is acting out and what place incest occupies in the plot This scenario is very like the Oedipus mythnot by reason of historical affiliation but because the mythic and ritualistic imaginations are using the same model in both cases Behind the pageantry of the African monarchies lurks the specter of the sacrificial crisis suddenly resolved by the unanimity arising from the generative act of violence Each African king is a new Oedipus obliged to play out his own myth from beginning to end because ritualistic theory sees in this enactment the means of renewing and perpetuating a cultural order that is constantly on the brink of destruction As in the case of Oedipus there was a charge of incest associated with the original act of mob violence and serving as its justification an accusation seemingly confirmed by the effective results of the collective action The king is thus required to do what he was originally accused of and to do it not to public acclaim but to the angry protests that accompanied the original accusation In principle the charge of incest will at each successive enthronement give rise to the same indignation the same collective violence that on the original occasion ac12 Luc de Heusch Aspects de la sacralite du pouvoir en Afrique in Le Pouvoir et le sacre Brussels 1962 Cited in L de Lagger Le Ruanda ancient Namur 1939 pp 20916 The Origins of Myth and Ritual 707 companied the slaughter that allayed the universal rage and led to the triumphant advent of the cultural order The relationship between royal incest and a prior accusation of incest is often confirmed by an etiological myth H J Krige and J D Krige report such a myth among the Lovedu13 Incest presides over the birth of society it is the bearer of peace and abundance to mankind But incest is neither a first cause nor an essential condition Although it may initially appear to offer justification for the act of sacrifice on a deeper level it is the act of sacrifice that justifies the incest The king reigns only by virtue of his future death he is no more and no less than a victim awaiting sacrifice a condemned man about to be executed The sacrifice itself is not the first but a ritualized form of the original outburst of violent unanimity Although the king is required to eat disgusting concoctions and commit all sorts of violent crimes there is no reason to associate his performance with the avantgarde theater or to see him as a sort of antihero of the contemporary counterculture The spirit behind these rites has nothing in common with such modern phenomena Rather than welcome the powers of evil with open arms the rites seek to exorcise them The king must show himself worthy of his punishmentfully as worthy as the original outcast from whom the ceremony derives It is important to cultivate the future victims supposed potential for evil to transform him into a monster of iniquitynot for esthetic reasons but to enable him to polarize to literally draw to himself all the infectious strains in the community and transform them into sources of peace and fecundity The principle of this metamorphosis has its source in the sacrifice of the monarch and subsequently pervades his entire existence on earth The investiture hymn of the Mossis Ouagadougous expresses with classic concision a dynamic formula for salvation that only my hypothesis of the surrogate victim can render intelligible You are a turd You are a heap of refuse You have come to kill us You have come to save us14 The king has a genuine function identical to that of any sacrificial victim He is the catalyst who converts sterile infectious violence into positive cultural values The monarchy might be compared to the factories that convert household refuse into fertilizer In both cases the 13 H J Krige and J D Krige The Lovedu of Transvaal in African Worlds London 1954 14 T Theuws Naitre et mourir dans le rituel Luba Zaire 14 23 Brussels 1960 172 Quoted by Makarius uDu roi magique au roi divin p 685 108 Violence and the Sacred resulting products are too potent to be applied at full strength they must be used with moderation and caution and on occasion be mixed with neutral agents The king fertilizes a farmers field from a safe distance if he passes too close the surface will be singed if he walks on it a blight will ensue The parallelism between the Oedipus myth and these African observances is striking There is no theme in the myth or the tragedy that does not find an echo here In certain cases the regulations relating to incest seem to reflect the double motif of infanticide and parricide as in the formal edict that forever separates the king from his son In other societies one can detect reflections of the other double motifs of the myth Like the son of Laius the king of the Nyoros has two little mothers and the chief of the Jukuns has two mistresses whom Luc de Heusch compares to the Nyoro pair15 5 MoroNaba film by J Rouch and D Zahan Produced by Comitc du film ethnolographique de 1IFAN Cited by Makarius Du roi magique au roi divin p 685 This parallelism is undoubtedly rooted in the presence of a sacred monarchy of the African type in archaic Greece Yet no matter how legitimate and even necessary this historical hypothesis may be it does not really serve to explain the Oedipus myth In order to explain the relationship between the myth ritual and tragedy as well as its parallelism with the African observances we must have perceived the real mechanism that hides behind all these cultural accretionsin particular the sacred monarchy which can 4 by no means be considered the irreducible element in the analysis We must grasp the role of the surrogate victim that is the conclusion of a crisis of reciprocal violence brought about through unanimous accord directed or redirected against a victim In Ambiguite et renversement pp 127172 JeanPierre Vernant has brought together many mythological and ritualistic details that forcefully suggest the inadequacy of certain fashionable psychological assumptions and the obstacles they present to a true appreciation of the scapegoatV role and associated phenomena The polarity between the king and the scapegoat a polarity the tragedy situates at the very heart of the figure of Oedipus was hardly invented by Sophocles It is ingrained in the religious practices and social theories of the Greeks The poet has lent it new meaning however in making it the symbol of mans fundamental ambiguity If Sophocles chose the tyrannospbarrnakos to illustrate what we have called the reversal theme it was because these two opposing figures appear symmetrical and to some degree interchangeable Each regards itself as an individual responsible for the collective salvation of the group In the works of Homer and Hesiod it is the king an offspring of Zeus who is responsible for the fertility of the soil the herds and the women As long as he shows himself irreproachable annembn in the dispensing of justice his people prosper but if he falters the whole community pays the penalty for the failing of this one individual The gods then visit misfortune on oWlrmos and lormos famine and plague The men kill each other the women cease to bear children the earth remains sterile and the flocks and herds no longer reproduce When such a divine calamity descends on a people their natural recourse is to sacrifice their king For if the king is responsible for the communitys fertility and this fertility ceases that indicates that the power invested in him as sovereign has somehow become inverted his justice turns to crime his integrity to corruption and the best aristos seems to be replaced by the worst kakistos The legends of Lycurgus Athamas and Oinoclus therefore involve as a means of putting the loimos to rout the lapidation of the king The Origins of Myth and Ritual 109 Behind the Athenian pharmakos behind the Oedipus myth there is real violence at work reciprocal violence brought to an end by the unanimous slaughter of the surrogate victim In almost every case the enthronement or renewal ritualsand in some cases the actual definitive death of the monarchare accompanied by mock combats between two factions These ritual confrontations sometimes enlisting the participation of the whole community recall the chaos and factionalism whose only cure lies in the surrogate victim And if this violent treatment of a surrogate victim serves as a model everywhere it is because it has actually proved effective in restoring peace and unity Only the social utility of this collective violence can account for a politicoritualistic scheme that consists not only of constantly repeating the process but also of making the surrogate victim the sole arbitrator of all conflicts proclaiming it a veritable incarnation of absolute sovereignty In many cases succession to the throne entails a ritual battle between father and son or between sons Luc de Heusch offers a description of such a struggle The death of the king triggers a war of succession a war whose ritualistic character can hardly be underestimated The princes reputedly employ their most potent magic medicines to eliminate their fraternal rivals At the core of this royal magic contest in Nkole appears the old theme of enemy brothers Factions congregate around the various claimants and the surviving brother is accorded the throne As we remarked earlier in a conflict whose course is no longer strictly regulated by a predetermined model the ritualistic elehis ritual murder or the sacrifice of his son But there are also instances where a member of the community is delegated to assume the role of the unworthy king the antisovereign The king then unloads on this inverted image of himself all his negative attributes We now have the true pharmakos the kings double but in reverse He is similar to those mock kings who are crowned at carnival time when everything is set topsyturvy and social hierarchies turned upside down when sexual prohibitions are lifted and theft permitted when servants take the place of their masters and women exchange clothing with men when in short the throne is yielded only to the basest ugliest most ridiculous and criminal of beings But once the carnival is over the antiking is expelled from the community or put to death and his disappearance puts an end to all the disorder that his person served to symbolize for the community and also to purge for it Vernants observations on Oedipus and the African monarchies are equally applicable to many other cases for they ultimately concern the ritualistic response to the presence of violence Once we recognize the role of unanimity in the operation of the surrogate victim it becomes clear that in these instances we are not dealing with gratuitous elaborations of superstition That is why Sophocles version should not be looked upon as something entirely new that adds a further dimension to the myth but as a reduction the partial demolishing of its mythological meaning both in regard to modern psychology and sociology and in regard to other ancient myths The poet lends no new meaning to the royal scapegoat he simply draws nearer the universal source of meanings 110 Violence and the Sacred rnents disintegrate into actual events and it becomes impossible to distinguish history from ritual This confusion is in itself revealing A rite retains its vitality only as long as it serves to channel political and social conflicts of unquestionable reality in a specific direction On the other hand it remains a rite only as long as it manages to restrict the conflictual modes of expression to rigorously determined forms e4 WHEREVER WE POSSESS DETAILED DESCRIPtions of specific renewal rites we observe that they too follow the general pattern of the sacrificial crisis incorporating its original violence These rites are to royalty as a whole what the microcosm is to the macrocosm The royal rites of Incwala in Swaziland have received particularly careful attention10 As the rites begin the king retires to his sacred enclosure where he imbibes various noxious potions and commits incest with a tribal sister These actions are intended to augment the kings silwane a term whose literal translation is to be like a savage beast Although this attribute is not the exclusive property of the king it serves to set him apart from his subjects The kings sihvane is always superior to anyone elses even that of his bravest warrior During this preparatory period the people intone a hymn the simemo which expresses their hatred of the king and their desire to see him expelled from the community From time to time the monarch more savagebeastly than ever puts in an appearance His nudity and the black paint with wrhich he has decorated his body serve as a symbol of defiance There then takes place a mock battle between the people and the royal clan in which the very person of the king is at stake Fortified in their turn with magic potions and swollen with silivane though to a lesser extent than their chiefthe armed warriors encircle the sacred enclosure and endeavor as it seems to take possession of the king who is protected by his entourage In the course of the rites presented here in abridged form a symbolic execution of the king also occurs With a touch of his wand the royal incarnation of violence transfers his own silwane to a cow thus transforming the animal into a raging bull which is then put to death As in the Dinka sacrifices the warriors hurl themselves all together and without weapons onto the beast belaboring it with their fists iT O Beidelman Swazi Royal Ritual Africa 36 1966373405 P A W Cook The Inqwala Ceremony of the Swazi Bantu Studies 4 1930 20510 M Gluckmaa Rituals of

temporarily efFaced This loss of differences has nothing to do with fraternization Rather it is the result of the violence that engulfs all the participants T O Beidelman defines this portion of the rites as a dissolving of distinctions11 Victor Turner describes the Incwala as a play of kingship in the Shakespearean sense of the expression The ceremony unleashes an increasing exaltation a dynamism that draws its energy from the very forces it puts in play forces that initially seem to claim the king as their victim but from which he eventually emerges as the absolute ruler At first almost sacrificed himself the king then presides at rites which show him to be the sacrificer par excellence There is nothing surprising about this duality it simply confirms the role we attributed to the surrogate victim its ability to master all violence Even when he is a victim the king remains the final arbiter of the contest and can intervene at anv point He plays all the roles and no form of violence no matter how extreme or eccentric is foreign to him At the height of the battle between the warriors and the king the king withdraws once more to his enclosure He reemerges armed with a gourd which he hurls at the shields of his assailants After this attack the groups disband H Kupers native informants told him that in time of war any warrior struck by the royal gourd would forfeit his life In the light of this information the anthropologist suggests that we look upon the warrior whom the king singles out to be struck by the gourd as a sort of national scapegoat This amounts to seeing him as a double for the king a man who symbolically dies in his place as the cow had done earlier in the ceremony The Incwala rites begin at the end of an old year and close at the beginning of a new year A relationship exists between the crisis commemorated by the rites and the end of a temporal cycle The rites follow certain natural rhythms but these rhythms can scarcely be regarded as a prime factor in the ceremonies even if they occasionally seem to overshadow the violence For it is the violence whose very presence establishes the essential function of all myths and rituals to disguise to divert and to banish disorder from the community At the close of the ceremonies a great bonfire is lit and on it are consumed all the pollutions accumulated in the course of the rites and in the course of the past year A symbolism of cleansing and purification pervades all the important stages of the ceremony 17 Beidelman Swazi Royal Ritual p 391 n 1 112 Violence and the Sacred e4 TO BE PROPERLY UNDERSTOOD royal incest must be perceived as part of a ritual pattern that is identical with the monarchy itself The king must be looked upon as a future sacrificial object that is as the replacement for the surrogate victim Incest then plays a relatively minor role in the proceedings Its purpose is to augment the effectiveness of the sacrifice And although the sacrifice directly linked as it is to spontaneous collective violence is perfectly intelligible without reference to incest the incest is unintelligible without reference to sacrifice To be sure the sacrificial element can disappear completely while the incest or incest symbolism persists This does not mean however that the sacrifice is subsidiary to the incest or that the incest can be considered without reference to the sacrifice Rather the participants have moved so far from the origin of events that they now regard their own rites from the same general perspective as Western observers one is almost tempted to say Western voyeurs The incest persists owing to its very strangeness In the collapse of ritualwhich in one sense is not really a collapse since it prolongs and reinforces the original delusionincest alone survives it alone is remembered when all else has been forgotten The African monarchy has now been reduced to a tourist attraction In addition modern ethnology has almost invariably isolated institutional incest from its context it consistently fails to appreciate its meaning because it insists on viewing incest as an autonomous event something so remarkable that it should have a significance all its own without reference to the surrounding phenomena Psychoanalysts perpetuate this error one might say they are its chief perpetrators It is by means of incest that the king assumes the mantle of royalty but the act itself is royal only in its demanding the death of those who commit it in its harkening back to the original victim This becomes apparent when we turn to a rather remarkable exception in the midst of those societies that prescribe royal incest namely a society in which the practice is formally and absolutely forbidden One might suppose that such a refusal simply entails a reversion to the general rule that prohibits incest But matters are not that simple The practice is not merely rejected and forbidden as it would be in most societies but these measures are accompanied by extraordinary precautions The monarchs entourage undertakes to remove all his close relatives from his presence and he is forced to imbibe not fortifying potions but debilitating ones All of which means of course that an aura of incest surrounds the throne an aura no less strong than those in The Origins of Myth and Ritual 113 the neighboring monarchies where royal incest is obligatory18 These special precautionary measures are justified solely by the kings dangerous vulnerability to this particular transgression Thus it might be said that the basic criterion of royalty remains the same Even in a society that formally excludes incest the king replaces an original victim who is believed to have violated the rules of exogamy It is as the heir and successor of this victim that the king is considered particularly susceptible to incest The copy is assumed to have all the qualities of the original The general rule proscribing the practice of incest is here reaffirmed but in such a peculiar manner that we can only regard it as an exception to the exception and classify it with the cultures that practice royal incest The essential question is this Why is the repetition of an incestuous actinvariably traced back to some original banished transgressor some founding father or mythic hero of the community regarded as salubrious by one society and noxious by its neighbor A contradiction of this kind among communities whose religious outlooks with the exception of their treatment of incest are so very similar seems to defy all efforts at rational inquiry The distribution of a religious theme such as royal incest throughout a cultural milieu of a certain range and variety suggests that influences in the traditional sense of the word are at work The incest theme cannot be original to each of these cultures that much seems clear Does this mean that my general hypothesis no longer applies I maintain that the original act of violence is the matrix of all ritual and mythological significations Strictly speaking this is only true of an act whose violence is absolute so to speak perfect completely spontaneous extreme Between this instance of complete originality and the mechanical repetition of rites at the other end of the scale we can assume the existence of an infinite number of intermediary forms 18 The Nioka impose continence on their chief for the rest of his life He is obliged to send away all the women of his household wear a penis sheath at all times and take sedative drugs Among the Njumbas of Kasai the chief wife the first wife of the chief is required to take medications that produce not only sterility but a complete suppression of the menstrual cycle The excessive character of these customs can be readily explained in terms of the conflict between a tradition of royal incest and the desire to allow no breach of the exogamic prohibition The Pendes in fact regard any hint of royal incest with great severity and they dismissed a chieftain from his position because he had once as a warrior treated his sister for an abdominal abscess You have seen the nakedness of your sister you are no longer fit to be our chief Makarius Du roi magique au roi divin p 671 On the Pendes see L Sousberge Etuis peniens ou gaines de chastete chez les baPende Africa 24 1954 and Structures de parente et alliance dapres les formules Pende Memoires de VAcadhnie royale des sciences coloniales beiges 4 no 1 1951 114 Violence and the Sacred The fact that certain religious and cultural themes pervade a vast area does not exclude the possibility that truly spontaneous collective violence working through one of the intermediary forms and endowed with real if limited creative powers on the mythic and religious level might occur in many places This would explain the many variants of the same myth the same cults from locality to locality and also the claim made by various places to be the birthplace of the same god It should be noted however that even though the myths and rituals are susceptible to infinite variation in detail they all revolve around a few major themes one of which is incest As soon as a community begins to regard an isolated individual as responsible for a sacrificial crisisthat is responsible for the disintegration of distinctions within the communityit follows that this same individual is accused of violating societys most fundamental rules the rules of kinship In short the individual is considered essentially incestuous in nature The theme of the incestuous outcast is not universal but it is found in many widely scattered cultural areas The fact that the theme turns up spontaneously in so many different places is not incompatible with the notion of cultural diffusion within a broad geographical expanse The surrogatevictim hypothesis offers a means of traversing the vast theoretical terrain between the passivity and excessively rigid continuity of the diffusionist theories on the one hand and the equally rigid discontinuity of modern formalism on the other While not excluding borrowings from other cultures my hypothesis confers on these borrowed elements a large degree of autonomy within their new setting This accounts for the strange contradiction of the strict requirement and the formal prohibition of royal incest existing side by side in neighboring societies In each instance we can see the same incest theme but reinterpreted in terms of local experience The ritualistic imagination strives to repeat the original generative process The unanimity that regulates pacifies and reconciles supplants the opposite situation displacing the paroxysm of violence that divides destroys and levels The transition from disruptive violence to order and peace is almost instantaneous The two different faces of the primordial experience are juxtaposed unanimity is attained in the course of a brief and terrifying meeting of opposites All sacrificial rites then reproduce certain forms of violence and appropriate certain associations that seem more suitable to the sacrificial crisis itself than to its cure Incest is an example In societies where it is an accepted practice royal incest is regarded as a means of salvation and in consequence an institution to be carefully preserved Such a reaction is perfectly intelligible The Origins of Myth and Ritual 115 The primaryin fact the solepurpose of the rite is to prevent the return of the sacrificial crisis Incest is a product of this crisis and even when it is attributed to the surrogate victim it still signifies the crisis it retains a sinister connotation We can understand therefore that the ritualistic mind might refuse to consider incest as a contribution to the communitys salvation even in its association with the surrogate victim It might persist in regarding incest even when committed by the representative and heir of the original victim as the ultimate act of evil capable of plunging the community into a highly contagious form of violence Incest then is simply another aspect of the affliction that the rites are designed to prevent But they attempt to prevent it by means of a cure that is intimately associated with the most virulent form of the affliction The ritualistic mind thus finds itself obliged to separate what cannot be separated and the solution must ultimately be an arbitrary one The ritualistic mind is perhaps more willing than we are to admit that good and evil are simply two aspects of the same reality but eventually it must distinguish between them even in the ritualistic framework where there are fewer differences than in any other area of human culture a distinction between the two must be apparent The purpose of the rite is to consolidate this difference newly restored after the terrible undifferentiation of the crisis There is nothing arbitrary or imaginary about the difference between violence and nonviolence but men always treat it as a difference within a process that is violent from beginning to end That is how the rite is made possible The rite selects a certain form of violence as good as necessary to the unity of the community and sets up in opposition to it another sort of violence that is deemed bad because it is affiliated to violent reciprocity In the same way the rite can designate certain forms of incest as goodfor example royal incestand others as bad It can equally well decide that all forms of incest are bad and refuse to admit even royal incest among those actions which if not actually sacrificial in character are still capable of contributing to the sacrificial powers of the monarch Given the fundamental importance to mankind of the transformation of bad violence into good and the equally fundamental inability of men to solve the mystery of this transformation it is not surprising that men are doomed to ritual nor is it surprising that the resulting rites assume forms that are both highly analogous and highly diverse That the ritualistic imagination can confront royal incest and derive two diametrically opposed solutions from it demonstrates both the arbitrary and the fundamental character of the difference between good that is sacrificial and bad violence In each culture the inverse 116 Violence and the Sacred solution can be felt behind each chosen solution In societies where it is an accepted and even an obligatory practice incest even royal incest still retains a sinister connotation it invites punishment and justifies the death of the king But in societies where it is forbidden incest has a certain beneficial quality in that the king is perceived as having a special predilection for incest and nothing closely associated to the king can be completely bad since the king brings unity and salvation to the community iMthough incest may have contradictory associations it is not simply a pawn on a structural chessboard to be moved about at will Nor can it be added or subtracted from the cultural picture simply to satisfy the whims of intellectual fashion We must take care that a formal structuralistic approach does not strip it completely of its dramatic impact nor must we permit psychoanalysis to pass it ofF as the meaning of meanings      IT IS IN THE DOMAIN of general anthropology that orthodox Freudianism is most vulnerable There is no formal psychoanalytical explanation of royal incest not even of the Oedipus myth no explanation of the interesting similarities between the Oedipus myth and the African monarchies With brilliant intuition Freud pointed the way toward patricide and incest but his disciples failed to follow his lead Instead of conceding the impotence of psychoanalysis in dealing with the subject most scholars even those hostile to psychoanalysis tacitly acknowledge its privilege to deal with anything remotely concerned with incest Nobody can approach the question of royal incest without saluting the stately ghost of Freud Yet psychoanalysis has never said and never can say anything decisive on the subject of royal incest anything that could add substantially to our understanding or for that matter approach the Master at his best The almost total absence of the incest motif in latenineteenthcentury Western culture led Freud to conclude that all human society is warped by a universal desire universally suppressed to commit maternal incest The presence of incest in the mythology and rituals of primitive peoples seemed to Freud an irrefutable proof of his hypothesis But psychoanalysis has never managed to explain why the absence of incest in one culture has exactly the same significance as the presence of incest in another There is no doubt that Freuds hypothesis was mistaken but he often had good reasons for being wrong whereas those who denounce his errors often have the wrong reasons for being right Freud perceived that the incest and patricide motifs of the Oedipus myth concealed something essential to the understanding of all aspects The Origins of Myth and Ritual 111 of culture The cultural context in which he functioned led him to believe that the crimes attributed to the surrogate victim were indeed the hidden desires of all men the secret source of human conduct Some of the cultural phenomena of the period could be at least partially explained in terms of the absence of patricidal or incestuous manifestations Psychoanalysis could not claim equal success as limited as this success might be in its approach to myths and religion When patricide and incest are openly displayed it is hard to see what it is they are hidingsome still better hidden instance of incest or patricide perhaps Even if one concedes such a theory it in no way serves to explain the other themes of the myth or even incest itself when it appears in a real form within a ritualistic framework19 Until some other approach succeeds where psychoanalysis has failed the claims of psychoanalysis will continue to influence us However once the Freudian interpretation of mythological and ritual incest has been replaced by another explanation at once very close to and very far removed from the Freudian viewpoint many thematic aspects of the issue will suddenly become clear and we will have good cause to believe that Freuds theory has finally had its day In the African monarchies as in the Oedipus myth incestmaternal or otherwiseis not primary matter absolute and irreducible It is an allusion that can readily be translated into other terms The same is true of patricide or any of the crimes perversions and monstrosities with which mythology abounds All these motifs and others as well serve to conceal and disguise rather than reveal the violent elimination of differences It is this particular violence that is the suppressed matter of the myths not suppressed desire but terror terror of absolute violence And who would deny that far stronger than desire in fact 19 The most favorable situation for psychoanalytic theories of this sort would be the total absence of incest and patricide from the entire corpus of mythology and ritual However psychoanalysis could also adjust to its constant presence to a continual intrusion of incest and patricide motifs The truth lies between these extremes Patricide figures in mythology and ritual but hardly more than any other type of criminal activity the same applies to incest Among the different kinds of incest maternal incest will at most play the role of primus inter pares unless it is replaced by the incestuous relationship with a sister or some other relative but never so fully or so systematically that one can attribute it merely to a reflex of the unconscious A statistical survey has been made dealing with violence between relations in myths of the Oedipus type These myths were drawn from some fifty selected cultures more or less evenly distributed within the six broad cultural regions defined by Murdock Clyde Kluckhohn sums up the results One can make a good case for antagonism against close relativesusually of the same sex as a prominent motif and a fair case for physical violence against such relatives But neither parricide nor Raglans regicide motifs will stand up literally without a great deal of farfetched interpretation Recurrent Themes in Myths and Mythmaking pp 5354 118 Violence and the Sacred the only force that can snuff out desire is that nameless but irresistible terror Widespread patricide and incest signify the final stages of the sacrificial crisis Limited to a single individual patricide and incest shift the whole burden of the crisis onto a surrogate victim The hidden basis of myths is not sexual it cannot be for that motif is openly revealed Nonetheless sexuality is important insofar as it stimulates violence and provides occasions for it to vent its force Like other natural phenomena sexuality is a real presence in myths In fact it plays a more important role in them than does nature itself but a role that is not truly decisive Sexuality becomes almost completely explicit in the incest motif There it is associated with a purely individual violence one however that still masks the collective violence This violence would surely wipe out the community were it not for the religious delusion that the surrogate victim provides The theory that mythological themes serve to express mans fear of natural phenomena has in the twentieth century given way to the idea that these same themes conceal mans fear of the purely sexual and incestuous nature of his desires The two theories are themselves mythic like the other theories we have discussed they function within the context of myth and help to perpetuate the delusions of myth However the two theories should not be put on the same footing Freud is less mythic than his predecessors sex is more involved in human violence than are thunder and earthquakes closer to the hidden sources of mythic elaboration Naked or pure sexuality is direcdy connected to violence It is the final veil shielding violence from sight at the same time it is the beginning of violences revelation Historically these two aspects of sexuality often dominate in turn periods of sexual liberation often precede some violent outburst This is true even in the chronological sequence of Freuds own work The dynamism of this work tends to transcend the initial pansexualism to engage itself in the ambiguous enterprise of Totem and Taboo or the radical concept of the death wish We can thus look on Freuds work as a step toward the revelation of something far more profound than the theory of suppressed desires a theory whose inadequacy he may have dimly perceived toward in fact the absolute violence still concealed by a certain delusion the nature of which remains in the broad sense sacrificial a3 Chapter Five ionvsus y f  y j l ALMOST EVERY SOCIETY HAS FESTIVALS that     1 have retained a ritualistic character over the centuries Of articular interest to the modern inquirer are observances involving the leliberate violation of established laws for example celebrations in yhich sexual promiscuity is not only tolerated but prescribed or in virich incest becomes the required practice Such violations must be viewed in their broadest context that of the verall elimination of differences Family and social hierarchies are emporarily suppressed or inverted children no longer respect their Darents servants their masters vassals their lords This motif is rejected in the esthetics of the holidaythe display of clashing colors he parading of transvestite figures the slapstick antics of piebald fools For the duration of the festival unnatural acts and outrageous behavior are permitted even encouraged As one might expect this destruction of differences is often accompanied by violence and strife Subordinates hurl insults at their superiors various social factions exchange gibes and abuse Disputes rage in the midst of disorder In many instances the motif of rivalry makes its appearance in the guise of a contest game or sporting event that has assumed a quasiritualistic cast Work is suspended and the celebrants give themselves over to drunken revelry and the consumption of all the food amassed over the course of many months I have no doubt that these festivities commemorate a sacrificial crisis It may seem strange to memorialize a traumatic event in such an uproarious manner but the explanation lies ready to hand The specifically festive aspects of the celebration those that most effectively capture the attention that dominate the spectacle and that are the only ones to survive the evolutionary transformations of the festival these aspects have nothing to do with the festivals underlying cause The fundamental purpose of the festival is to set the stage for a sacrificial act that marks at once the climax and the termination of the festivities Roger Caillois has pointed out the sacrificial origin of fes119 120 Violence and the Sacred tivals1 If the crisis brought on by the loss of distinctions and the subsequent advent of reciprocal violence can be celebrated in such a jubilant fashion it is because these holocausts are seen in retrospect as the initial stages of a cathartic process The beneficial character of the generative unanimity tends to be projected onto the past affecting the initial impression of the crisis and making it seem other than it was The violent dismissal of distinctions now acquires a favorable connotation which will eventually manifest itself as a festive display I have already advanced a number of interpretations that may prove relevant to the subject of festivals For example ritual incest ultimately acquires a beneficial aspect that seems to be almost wholly independent of its sacrificial quality In certain societies the aristocrats and even the artisans have recourse to ritual incest more or less furtively to bring them good luck before a difficult or hazardous undertaking The rites performed during the enthronement of certain African monarchs or in the course of renewal ceremonies often resemble festival practices Conversely in festivals in which the monarch plays no direct role we encounter a substitute kingsometimes a king of foolswho is himself nothing more than a sacrificial victim endowed with sacral privileges at the conclusion of the festivities he or his representative will be sacrificed The kings sovereigntyreal or imagined permanent or temporaryseems to derive from an original generative act of violence inflicted on a surrogate victim The function of the festival is no different from the function of other sacrificial rites As Emile Durkheim perceived the festival revitalizes the cultural order by reenacting its conception reproducing an experience that is viewed as the source of health and abundance reenacting in fact the moment when the fear of falling into interminable violence is most intense and the community is therefore most closely drawn together Primitive peoples regard their cultural tradition as a fragile and precious inheritance to be carefully nurtured and protected from any change for change could only serve to damage it perhaps mortally The skepticism and resentment we moderns feel toward taboos of any kind which feelings we tend to assume are shared by primitive peoples play no part in their festivities The oftencited syndrome of release of tensions or that muchridden hobbyhorse of psychosociologists the necessary outlet has relevance only to a single aspect of the ritual process and an exclusive emphasis on these syndromes distorts the original spirit of the ritual Festivals are based on the assumption that there is a direct link 1 Roger Caillois Man and the Sacred trans Meyer Baxash Glencoe 111 1959 chap 4 pp 97127 Dionysus 121 between the sacrificial crisis and its resolution The crisis is inseparable from its happy ending and becomes itself a cause for jubilation But this interpretation is not the only one possible As we have already noticed in the case of royal incest religious thinking on the relationship between the crisis and its conclusion can result in two divergent viewpoints Either it is the continuity between crisis and conclusion that strikes the imagination or it is the rupture in each instance the resulting interpretation must be both partially true and partially false Yet religious thinking tends to adopt one or another of the two solutions and cling to it for dear lifeeven if at the outset the choice could easily have gone the other way It can be assumed almost a priori that certain societies will opt for the second solution the one that emphasizes the rupture between the crisis and the founding violence In such cases another kind of festival will arise one that in comparison with the festival we have been describing might perhaps be called an antifestival The rites of sacrificial expulsion are not preceded by a period of frenzied anarchy but by an extreme austerity and an increased rigor in the observance of all interdicts Extraordinary precautions are taken to prevent the community from falling prey once again to reciprocal violence In fact both solutions can be observed In some societies we encounter ritual occasions that resemble festivalsthere is the same periodicity the same interruption of normal activities the same rites of sacrificial expulsionand yet are so very different from festivals that they constitute a vexing problem for ethnologists one similar to the enigma of royal incest which is accepted in some societies and forbidden in others Far from being temporarily suspended in the antifestival all cultural prohibitions are strongly reinforced The rites of the Swazi Incwala correspond closely to the definition of the antifestival Throughout the period of observance all sexual activity including the most legitimate is forbidden Sleeping late in the morning is regarded as a crime and physical contact between individuals is to be avoided even physical contact with ones own body the celebrants are not supposed to wash or to scratch themselves A threat of imminent pollutionthat is of violencehangs over the entire community All singing and loud noise are prohibited Children are scolded if they grow noisy at play In The Golden Bough Frazer offers a fine example of an antifestival For several weeks in the year the Cape tribe on the Gold Coast permit no sound of tomtoms or musket fire Public conversations are forbidden If a dispute arises and voices are raised the contesting parties are summoned before the chieftain who deals out stiff fines to everyone involved To avoid arguments over strayed livestock all lost animals 122 Violence and the Sacred become the property of their finders and the original owners are obliged to relinquish all claim It seems clear that such measures are intended to prevent the outbreak of widespread violence Frazer offers no explanation for them but his anthropological intuition far superior to his theorizing prompted him to classify these practices under the rubric of festivals The logic of the antifestival is as strict as that of the festival The goal is to reproduce the beneficial effects of violent unanimity while abbreviating as much as possible the terrible preliminarieswhich in the case of the antifestival are perceived in a negative light The longer the interval between any two purifying rituals the greater the danger of a violent explosion Impurities accumulate and in the period immediately preceding the celebration of the rite a period saturated with the memory of the sacrificial crisis everyone moves with extreme caution It is as if the community had suddenly become an arsenal piled high with gunpowder The Saturnalia has been transformed into its opposite the feast changed to a fast but the purpose of the ritual remains the same In addition to the festival and the antifestival one finds as might have been expected mixed ceremonies resulting from a more complex more nuanced concept of the relationship between the crisis and the restoration of order a concept that takes into account both the continuity and the discontinuity between them In some instances at least these variations can be seen as a late development resulting from the sheer remoteness of the original violence that is from the cumulative effect of mythological elaboration All too often we go astray when examining the nature of the festival and allow our attention to be diverted to secondary aspects Under these circumstances the events hidden behind the rite become increasingly inaccessible and the rites unity of purpose splinters into many incompatible segments At the very point when the religious aspects of the rite have begun to reflect an ignorance equal to our own the rite suddenly appears to have a timely and original function whereas this function is in fact belated and derivative The asceticism and mortifications of the antifestivals seems very far removed from the kind of activity we associate with a festival We fail to grasp that they share a common origin and that in those communities where the ritual has retained its greatest vitality they often achieve a dialectical equilibrium The more the rites diverge from their true function the more differentiated they appear and the more interesting they become to scholars who can sort them out in different categories Modern scholarship notably since Frazer is no longer unaware that certain festivals entailed human sacrifice Nonetheless we are still far Dionysus 123 lorn suspecting that the distinctive traits of this practice and their nnumerable variations can be traced back directly or indirectly to a generative act of collective violence a liberating gesture of mob anger The origin of the festival can still be discerned even in those instances where sacrificial immolation has been eliminated from the proceedings The disappearance of the sacrificial event may lead to new rites whose sacrificial character is easily identifiablerites of exorcism for example These rites occupy the same place as the vanished sacrifice and even when they are not directly linked to sacrifice they serve the same function in the ceremonies In short they can be said to be a replacement for the sacrifice What is the correct procedure for ridding a person or place of devils and evil spirits Often it is a matter of shouting clanging weapons or cooking vessels and beating the air with a stick Nothing seems more natural than to take a broom to the devilif that is one is stupid enough to believe in his existence The modern intellectual the liberated Frazerian therefore concludes that primitives liken the spirit of evil to some great beast that takes to its heels when frightened The rationalistic mind does not bother with customs that seem not only puerile in conception but lacking all reason In this case as in many others a complacent intellect and the seeming naturalness of the circumstances can serve to conceal their most interesting aspects In principle the act of exorcism is an act of violence perpetrated against the devil or his associates In some festivals this terminal violence is preceded by mock combat between the exorcists themselves We recognize here a pattern repeated in many sacrificial rites the actual immolation is preceded by ritual disputes between the sacrificers in which the violence is to some extent simulated This phenomenon of mock combat must stem in all instances from the same general source In an example adduced by Frazer the young men of the village go from house to house pausing at each to perform the rites of exorcism The tour begins with a quarrel about which house to visit first hs a good positivist Frazer takes care to include even those details that do not fit neatly into his own scheme for this reason alone he deserves our gratitude and respect The preliminary quarrel is a reminder of the sacrificial crisis the sacrifice or exorcism that follows emulates the unanimous violence which is in effect promptly grafted onto the reciprocal violence and distinguished from it only by its miraculous results At the conclusion of the quarrel unanimity is achieved and the moment has come for the surrogate victim for the performance of the sacrifice The object of the quarrel is ostensibly the sacrifice itself that is the selection of the victim In the course of the quarrel each 124 Violence and the Sacred disputant strives to put in a final word reducing his antagonist to silence each wants to get in the decisive blow the one that permits no response and that will therefore serve as a model for the rite itself Greek legends often contain vague reference to a sacrificea human sacrificeoffered bv a community city or army to some god The persons involved agree on the need for such a sacrifice but disagree on the choice of victim To understand the situation the investigator must reverse the order of events First comes the violence spontaneous and senseless then comes the sacrificial explanation genuinely sacrificial in that it conceals the senseless and basically intolerable aspect of the violence The sacrificial explanation is rooted in an act of terminal violence violence that can only be labeled sacrificial retrospectively because it brought all hostilities to an end These stories may represent the minimal form of mythological fabrication A collective murder that brings about the restoration of order imposes a kind of ritualistic framework on the savage fury of the group all of whose members are out for one anothers blood Murder becomes sacrifice the angry freeforall that preceded it is transformed into a ritual dispute over the choice of the most suitable victim one that satisfies the piety of the faithful or has been selected by the god In effect the real question behind these preliminaries is Who will kill whom The dispute concerning the first dwelling to be exorcised screens the same confiictual process leading to the violent resolution of the crisis Exorcism represents the last chain in a series of reprisals Having succumbed to reciprocal violence the celebrants as a group vent their fury on the empty air We see here manifested a truth common to all rites but never more clearly displayed than in this type of exorcism Ritual violence awakens no hostility confronts no antagonist as long as their blows are directed as a group against an insubstantial presence which for excellent reasons shows no tendency to retaliate in kind the exorcists are not likely to resume their quarrel And here the rite reveals its origin and function The unanimity attained through the intervention of the surrogate victim must not be lost The community stands united before the onslaught of evil spirits and remains faithful to its vow to reject mutual hostility The rite reaffirms and reinforces this resolution And religious thought returns again and again to that supreme wonder that last word of violence which is all the more precious for being pronounced so late in the day Sacrifice is the boon worthy above all others of being preserved celebrated and memorialized reiterated and reenacted in a thousand different forms for it alone can prevent transcendental violence from turning back into reciprocal violence the violence that really hurts Dionysus 125 setting man against man and threatening the total destruction of the community 43 THIS GENERAL THEORY of the sacrificial crisis and violent unanimity seems to clarify aspects of the festival that have hitherto remained obscure As the ritualistic aspects of the festival dwindle it degenerates into a communal letting off of steamthe very idea of the festival held dear by modern scholars The gradual loss of ritualistic structure and the constantly increasing misunderstandings surrounding the festival seem to go hand in hand The disintegration of myths and rituals and indeed of religious thought in general leads not to genuine demythologizing but to the outbreak of a new sacrificial crisis The joyous peaceful facade of the deritualized festival stripped of any reference to a surrogate victim and its unifying powers rests on the framework of a sacrificial crisis attended by reciprocal violence That is why genuine artists can still sense that tragedy lurks somewhere behind the bland festivals the tawdry utopianism of the leisure society The more trivial vulgar and banal holidays become the more acutely one senses the approach of something uncanny and terrifying The theme of holidaygonewrong dominates Fellinis films and has recently surfaced in various different forms in the work of many other artists The holidaygonewrong serves nicely to symbolize decadence As an artistic motif it is rich in fruitful paradoxes What is more it is a very real part of the scene in any decadent society To ascertain this we have only to look at the festal practices of obviously failing societies such as the Yanomamo who are torn apart by perpetual civil war or even more strikingly of societies in the final stages of disintegration such as the Kaingang The festival as celebrated in these societies has lost all its ritual characteristics it has gone wrong in the sense that it has reverted to its violent origins Instead of holding violence in check the ceremonies inaugurate a new cycle of revenge By a process of inversion that can befall all rites and that we have already had occasion to observe in the case of sacrificial rites the festival ceases to function as a preventive measure and lends its support to the forces of destruction The killing was to be done in traditional Kaingang style they the future victims were to be invited to a festa made to drink and then slaughtered Although the Kaingang associate festas with quarreling and murder they never refused an invitation to one even though they knew their lives were in danger One might imagine that at a festa where large 126 Violence and the Sacred sections of the tribe came together to enjoy themselves the bonds of kinship would be renewed and strengthened and old attachments of man for man would draw new warmth from the general good feeling Although this was true of some Kaingang festas they were as often the scene of violent quarreling and disruption as they were of friendliness and solidarity The men and women got drunk and the men boasted to their children of their invulnerability and their deeds of blood The men told their waikayu hubris walking about shaking either clubs or lances slashing at the air crying out the deeds they had done and the murders they would yet commit As the beer and the excitement mounted to their heads they turned on their neighbors and quarreled with them because they suspected them of adultery with their wives or because they themselves had had affairs with their neighbors wives and themselves felt suspected and hatedKaingang folklore abounds in accounts of festivals that turn into massacres and the Kaingang expression We shall make beer for him has decidedly sinister connotations e4 LET US NOW APPLY our newfound concept of the festival to the myth of Dionysus as portrayed in Euripides tragedy The Bacchae This analysis will concern itself with issues referred to in the discussion of the Oedipus mvth I hope it will help to clarify my thesis of the role of violence while also directing attention to new7 problems of significance A bacchanal is a festival in the sense just defined it displays all the characteristics previously discussed The Bacchae begins as a ritual bacchanal The poet underlines the destruction of distinctions as the god sweeps away all the barriers that usually divide mortals wealth age sex and so on Everyone is called on to worship Dionysus the chorus proclaims that graybeards will now mingle with youths women will be on a par with men The bacchanal portrayed by Euripides involves the women of Thebes Having established his worship in Asia Dionysus arrives in his native city in the guise of a young disciple of his own cult who exerts a potent influence over almost everyone who encounters him Seized by the spirit of the god Dionysuss own aunt Agaue his cousin Ino and all the women of Thebes desert hearth and home to wander the slopes of Mount Cithaeron celebrating the first bacchanal Idyllic at first the bacchantes revel soon becomes a bloodthirsty nightmare The delirious women hurl themselves indiscriminately on men and beasts Only Pentheus king of Thebes and son of Agaue 2 Henry jungle People pp 5657 Dionysus 121 persists in denying the divinity of his cousin Like Tiresias and Creon in Oedipus the Kiig Pentheus is an outsider who before succumbing to the universal frenzy lucidly defines the situation I have just returned from my travels to hear news of the strange illness that afflicts our city The strange illness is clearly the sacrificial crisis It has struck with lightning speed inciting its victims to irrational acts The sacrificial crisis makes no distinction between those who submit to its demands out of prudence or opportunismlike the two old menand the only man who has the boldness to reject itthe unfortunate Pentheus Whether one chooses to fight or to submit violence triumphs Throughout the tragedy the Bacchic spirit is presented as indistinguishable from the infectious evil Pentheus rebukes his grandfather who has attempted to persuade him to join in worshiping the god Do not breathe your infection on me go and play the bacchant The Dionysiac outbreak spells the disintegration of social institutions and the collapse of the cultural order both of which disasters are dramatically symbolized by the destruction of the royal palace at the climax of the action It is futile to attempt to restrain the god of violence Pentheus tries to imprison the defiant youth whose form Dionysus has assumed but even as everything around him is engulfed in flame the god steps forth unharmed from the ruins The Bacchae takes as its subject a festival that goes wrong And we will hardly be surprised at this unpleasant turn of events when we consider that this bacchanal is none other than the original bacchanal that is the sacrificial crisis The tragedy seems to offer strong evidence in support of my theory of the meaning of festivals It traces the festival back to its violent beginnings back to its origins in reciprocal violence Euripides subjects the myth and worship of Dionysus to the same sort of treatment that Sophocles applied to the Oedipus myth He brings into plav the conflictual symmetry behind the mythological message and as with Oedipus behind the ritea message that conceals this symmetry at least as much as it displays it The playwrights task was made easier because the bacchanal perpetuates an essential aspect of the sacrificial crisis the destruction of differences Beginning as a gesture of harmony the Dionysiac elimination of distinctions rapidly degenerates into a particularly virulent form of violent nondifferentiation The abolishment of sexual differences which appears in the ritual bacchanal as a celebration of love and brotherhood becomes in the tragedy an act of hostility The women take up the most violent masculine activities hunting and warfare They deride men for their weakness and femininity Dionysus in the 128 Violence and the Sacred guise of a longhaired adolescent personally takes a hand in fomenting the disorder Pentheus having reproached the god for his effeminate appearance is seized bv the desire to disguise himself in womans dress so that he can spy on the bacchantes on the slopes of Mount Cithaeron We also find in The Bacchae reference to that loss of distinction between man and beast that is always linked to violence The bacchantes hurl themselves on a herd of cattle which they mistake for prying men and tear them apart with their bare hands And Pentheus mad with rage imprisons a bull in his stable in the belief that he has captured Dionysus himself Agaue commits the inverse error when the bacchantes discover her son Pentheus spying on them she mistakes him for a young lion and strikes the first blow to kill him Another difference that tends to disappear in the course of the tragedy is the seemingly indelible distinction between man and godin this instance between Pentheus and Dionysus There is no aspect of Dionysus that fails to find a reflection in Pentheus Dionysus is a dual figure On the one hand there is the Dionysus of the Maenads the defender of divine and human laws the jealous guardian of legality on the other there is the subversive agentprovocateur of the tragedy the figure we have considered above This same duality can be seen in Pentheus The king of Thebes introduces himself to us as a pious conservative a guardian of traditional values Yet the chorus denounces him as a bold lawbreaker whose blasphemy exposes the city to divine retribution There is no doubt that Pentheus contributes to the chaos he claims to oppose He dons the garb of a bacchant and becomes possessed by Dionysus that is by violencea violence that eliminates all distinctions between creatures whether men or gods through the paradoxical means of fierce antagonism The characteristics of each protagonist are all reproduced to a degree in the other For example the divinity of Dionysus is counterbalanced by a secret humanity implied by his appearance as a longhaired youth Similarly the humanity of Pentheus is counterbalanced if not bv divinity at least by a delusion of divinity revealed in the superhuman claims that accompany his final submission to the Dionysiac spirit Could I not lift up on my shoulders Gthaeron and all its groves w7ith all the reveling bacchantes In the Dionysiac frenzy all differences between man and god tend to disappear If there is a voice of Dionysiac orthodoxy in the play it can only be that of the Lvdian Maenads who address us in unequivocal terms Godinspired madness has made each celebrant another Dionysus The Lvdian chorus declares Who leads the dance becomes a Bromios It has been said that the delirium of Pentheus and the Theban bacDionysus 129 chantes is due to a culpable hubris whereas everything relating to Dionysus and his Maenads is truly divine Even the worst forms of violence are legitimate because god is god and man is man There is some apparent truth in that As far as the overall plot of the play is concerned the difference between man and god is never lost sight of in fact it is strongly proclaimed at the beginning and end of the tragedy Yet in the middle all differences mingle and dissolve including the distinction between human and divine As we have seen tragic inspiration leads to the same results in The Bacchae as in Oedipus the Kiig Mythological and ritual values are abolished by reciprocal violence The subjective nature of all differences is exposed We are compelled to confront a vital question pertaining to myth and the cultural order Sophocles stopped just short of framing this question and concludes by reaffirming the compromised mythological values Euripides follows the same procedure in The Bacchae The symmetry is so implacably applied that in the end it dissolves the difference between man and god Divinity becomes nothing more than a prize in the struggle between two rivals You know    how happy you are when a great crowd greets you at your doors and all the city glorifies the name of Pentheus Bacchus also loves such honors I am sure  In any case at the end of the play the uniqueness of the deity is reaffirmed and in terrifying fashion It is made abundantly clear that no real contest ever existed between the omnipotent Dionysus and the culpably weak Pentheus The triumph of difference once again shields from sight the recently exposed tragic symmetry Once again tragedy seems to oscillate between audacity and indecision In the case of Sophocles the conflict between the symmetry of the tragic action and the dissymetry of the mythological content is our only reason for believing that the poet knowingly or unknowingly recoiled before an act of even greater audacity In the case of The Bacchae the same textual conflict is present and we are led by the same process to a similar conclusion Euripides too backed off from commiting an act of even greater audacity But this time the backing off is not performed in silence His tragedies contain numerous passages whose emphatic tone and repetition of theme clearly mark them as expressions of the poets decision to retreat and his attempts to justify himself Human wisdom is not wisdom and to aspire to more than mans due is to shorten life is to sacrifice the fruit at hand for what is out of reach I think it is sheer madness or plain stupidity to act in such a manner    Keep heart and mind aloof from overreaching intellects The beliefs and practices common to the common man are good enough for me 130 Violence and the Sacred Scholars are far from agreement on the interpretation of such passages and much of the modern debate on Euripides centers on this problem It may be that the whole question has been falsified by a postulate implicitly accepted by all the commentators This postulate relates to the type of knowledge the poet has declined to confront We have taken it for granted that such knowledge cannot be unknown to us the idea that anyone so remote from modern thought as Euripides could have perceived a danger wholly unsuspected by us could have anticipated a truth whose existence has escaped us completely hardly seems worth consideration Modern critics are convinced that Euripides drew back before that same skepticism of which they are themselves the proud proponents an intellectual viewpoint that denies the existence of a real basis for religion and declares the whole institution purely imaginary Euripides they suggest hesitated from conventional propriety or simple prejudice to acknowledge that religion was nothing more than mystification an illusion specifically designed to offer consolation or impose restraints Timidity kept him from acknowledging that religion was a figment of the imagination The modern intellectual is a romantic soul who likes to think of himself as the boldest iconoclast in history7 At times he cannot but challenge the high place accorded Euripides by tradition and wonder whether the poet is not essentially too bourgeois in spirit to warrant such esteem But Euripides speaks less in terms of religious faith in the modern sense than in terms of the transgressing of limits of the fearsome knowledge that exists beyond these limits We do not seem to be dealing in his case with a simple choice between belief and disbelief two equally abstract concepts Something else is at play something more to the point than sterile religious scepticism This something else still to be discerned is nonetheless near at hand in the text of The Bacchae k THE MURDER OF PENTHEUS serves as both culmination and resolution of a crisis provoked by the god himself in revenge for the Thebans failure to pay homage to him and especially for the resistance of his own family Having brought about Pentheus death the god banishes the rest of the family from the city Peace and harmony now return to Thebes which will henceforth honor the god in the manner ordained by him The murder thus appears as the outcome of a divine plan and at the same time the result of a spontaneous outburst The divine plan falls within the formalized framework of ritual sacrifice In this instance the Dionysus 131 god himself is the sacrificer and prepares the future victim the sacrificial act ordained by him coincides with the act of revenge that will appease his anger Under the pretext of arranging his costume and coiffure Dionysus manages to touch Pentheus ritualistically on his head waist and feet The murder itself is performed in accordance with Dionysiac practice it includes the distinctive sparagmos or dismemberment which we have already encountered in other sacrificial contexts In addition 1 all the bacchantes participate in the killing This satisfies the requirements of unanimity which figures in so many rituals And 2 no weapon is used the victim is torn apart by the womens bare hands Such a performance is not peculiar to the Dionysiac cult We have already cited two examples of collective murders without weapons one in a Dinka sacrifice and the other part of the Swazi Incwala where a cow is substituted for the king there are many similar examples The assertionmade by Rudolf Otto among others that the Dionysiac rites were unique can easily be disproved There is no aspect of the Dionysiac myth or ritual that does not find a distinct echo in many primitive societies The Euripidean version of the myth emphasizes the spontaneous aspect of the ritualistic proceedings and thus affords us a fleeting glimpseor at least a strong intimationof a real relationship between the rite and a past event grounded in fact and partially reconstituted by the dramatist The dismemberment of a living victim by unarmed assailants each participating wholly in the act takes on a clear meaning Even without Euripides detailed description we can imagine the original scene It would not have been a case of premeditated assassination Everything suggests a crowd whose intentions were initially pacific a disorganized mob that for unknown reasons of no real importance to our argument came to a high pitch of mass hysteria The crowd finally hurled itself on one individual even though he had no particular qualifications for this role he served to polarize all the fears anxieties and hostilities of the crowd His violent death provided the necessarv outlet for the mass anguish and restored peace3 The ritual sparagmos reenacts with scrupulous exactitude the mob violence that brought riot and disorder to an end In the ritual performance the community tries to mimic the gestures that effected its salvation It is also trying paradoxically enough to recapture through ritual the element of complete spontaneity Here as elsewhere tragedy occupies an ambiguous intermediary position between the ritual performance and the spontaneous model that the ritual attempts to reproduce From the point of view of established religious doctrine 3 The best treatment of the crowds role in abolishing differences is Elias Canettis Crowds and Power trans Carol Stewart New York 1966 132 Violence and the Sacred Dionysus is wholly responsible for Pentheus murder After all the god is master of events it is he who prepares from afar the details of the first sacrifice his own sacrificial enterprise that is the most awesome and effective of all sacrifices the one that truly mends the shattered community But from the point of view of a religioninthemaking the murder of Pentheus appears as a spontaneous resolution that could be neither planned nor anticipated The collective violence is openly displayed but the essential process the arbitrary choice of the victim and the sacrificial substitution that restores unityremains concealed The actual expulsion of the victim recedes from sight and maintains its efficiency by appearing only in the guise of institutionalized sacrifice From the viewpoint of the sacrificial crisis the relationship between the doubles Dionysus and Pentheus is reciprocal in a double sense There is no reason why it should be Dionysus rather than Pentheus who sacrifices his companion Yet from the viewpoint of established religion even if this reciprocity is at one level acknowledged and the sacrificer and his victim are recognized as doubles on another and more basic level this same reciprocitv is abolished The direction must not be allowed to reverse itself it has been fixed once and for all and the expulsion is always understood to have already taken place We cannot hope to understand the rite merely by attributing it to psychic motivations either conscious or unconscious And in spite of all appearances gratuitous sadism plays no part in the procedure The rite is directed toward order and tranquillity not violence It strives to achieve violence solely in order to eliminate it Nothing is more naive or in the final analysis more futile than the speculations psychological theorists derive from the brutality of a rite such as the sparagmos The Bacchae offers ample evidence in support of my definition of sacrifice Euripides tragedv and the whole cult of Dionysus seem to provide strong support for the hypothesis that traces myth and ritual to a generative act of unanimity e4 THE IMPARTIAL READER approaching the play free of the influence of Nietzsche or Rudolf Otto is always struck by the sheer perfidy of Dionysuss role Throughout the play the god wanders from place to place engendering violence and crime with the artfulness of a satanic seducer Only the quixotic masochism of our own age the result of a long immunity to the violence that threatens primitive societies allows us to see anything attractive in the Dionysus of The Bacchae It seems clear that Euripides shares none of our illusions which would be comic if they were less disquieting Dionysus 133 The god has no proper being outside the realm of violence All his attributes are linked to violence if he is associated with the gift of prophetic inspiration like the Delphic Apollo who figures in the Oedipus myth it is because prophetic inspiration is part of the sacrificial crisis And if he later appears as the god of wine that is probably a more sedate version of his original designation as the god of homicidal fury Certainly there is nothing in the ancient Dionysiac tradition that alludes directly to viniculture or the production of wine4 In The Bacchae the epiphany of the god arises from the catastrophic consequences of the sacrificial crisis which is symbolized by the destruction of Pentheuss palace Chorus Divine tremor shake the floor of the earth Dionysus See The palace of Pentheus trembles It falls Dionysus is standing there Bow down before him Chorus We bow down before him Ah see the marble friezes fall Bromios will shout with triumph within Dionysus Let divine lightning be the torch Now set afire the ruins of Pentheuss palace Chorus Ah ah Look look Around the sacred tomb of Semele the eversmouldering fire leaps in flame Prostrate yourselves before your god O Maenads The palace falls He is coming the son of Zeus It may seem surprising even scandalous that the incarnation of the most terrible forms of violence should be an object of veneration as well as of fear In this case however it is not the worshipers who are naive but the bewildered observers If we examine more closely the specific types of violence associated with the god we find that an overall pattern appears This pattern seems to confirm our interpretation of Pentheuss murder as a Dionysiac sacrifice Under the name of Brontiosthe Noisemaker the EarthshakerDionysus presides over disasters that have nothing to do with the thunderstorms and earthquakes beloved of nineteenthcentury scholars but that in fact always involve a mob impelled by sheer panic to the performance of extraordinary acts Tiresias defines Dionysus as the god of mob hysteria of sudden onslaughts of collective fear Soldiers in full battle array and poised for combat are transfixed by panic before a lance has touched them This hysteria is Dionysuss work Such statements added to the ones we have already collected and to 4Cf Henri Jeanmaire Dionysos Histoire du culte de Bacchus Paris 1970 p 23 134 Violence and the Sacred the body of evidence drawn from other rices leads to the inescapable conclusion that Dionysus is the god of decisive mob action Once stated it should be easy to see why such a god is called for and why he is revered He claims legitimacy not from his ability to disturb the peace but from his ability to restore the peace he has himself disturbed thereby justifying a posteriori having disturbed it in the first place Divine intervention is transformed into legitimate anger against a blasphemous hubris which until the crucial display of unanimity seemed to implicate the god himself Textual criticism confirms the theories that portray the Dionysiac cult as a consequence of major political and social upheavals In spite of its limitations a work like Erwin Rohdes Psyche manifests a profound intuitive grasp of reality In the absence of new documentary evidence the traditional historical method can make little progress Only a comparative analysis of texts and of significant religious phenomena a method utilized by Rohde but on too small a scale can substantially increase our knowledge5 Along with any known historical context we can infer behind a myth like that of The Bacchae a sudden outbreak of violence so extreme as to threaten the very existence of the community This threat will eventually be withdrawn as rapidly as it appeared thanks to a type of mob violence that reconciles all members of the community because it involves the participation of all The metamorphosis from peaceable citizens into raging beasts is too terrifying and too transitory for the community to accept it as issuing from within itself As soon as calm has been miraculously restored the past tumult will be looked upon as a supreme example of divine intervention Angered at discovering himself ignored or misrepresented a god has made known his wishes in a thoroughly godlike manner Having accepted a final victim a victim of his own choice in which he may also be incarnated he silently withdraws from the scene He will be as benevolent from afar as he was terrible in propinquity Religion then is far from useless It humanizes violence it protects man from his own violence by taking it out of his hands transforming it into a transcendent and everpresent danger to be kept in check by the appropriate rites appropriately observed and by a modest and prudent demeanor Religious misinterpretation is a truly construc5 Erwin Rohde Psyche The Cult of Souls and Belief in Immortality among the Greeks trans W B Hillis from the 8th ed London and New York 1925 In his remarkable Dionysos Jeanmaire offers a critical appraisal of the sociological approach His thesis which emphasizes ecstatic aspects of the cult and the signs of possession can be reconciled with an awareness of social and historical aspects through my hypothesis of the sacrificial crisis and unanimous generative violence Dionysus 135 tive force for it purges man of the suspicions that would poison his existence if he were to remain conscious of the crisis as it actually took place To think religiously is to envision the citys destiny in terms of that violence whose mastery over man increases as man believes he has gained mastery over it To think religiously in the primitive sense is to see violence as something superhuman to be kept always at a distance and ultimately renounced When the fearful adoration of this power begins to diminish and all distinctions begin to disappear the ritual sacrifices lose their force their potency is no longer recognized by the entire community Each member tries to correct the situation individually and none succeeds The withering away of the transcendental influence means that there is no longer the slightest difference between a desire to save the city and unbridled ambition between genuine piety and the desire to claim divine status for oneself Everyone looks on a rival enterprise as evidence of blasphemous designs It was at such a moment that all the distinctions between Dionysus and Pentheus were effaced Men set to quarreling about the gods and their skepticism leads to a new sacrificial crisis that will appear retrospectively in the light of a new manifestation of unanimous violenceas a new act of divine intervention and divine revenge Men would not be able to shake loose the violence between them to make of it a separate entity both sovereign and redemptory without the surrogate victim Also violence itself offers a sort of respite the fresh beginning of a cycle of ritual after a cycle of violence Violence wrill come to an end only after it has had the last word and that word has been accepted as divine The meaning of this word must remain hidden the mechanism of unanimity remain concealed For religion protects man as long as its ultimate foundations are not revealed To drive the monster from its secret lair is to risk loosing it on mankind To remove mens ignorance is only to risk exposing them to an even greater peril The only barrier against human violence is raised on misconception In fact the sacrificial crisis is simply another form of that knowledge which grows greater as the reciprocal violence grows more intense but which never leads to the whole truth It is the knowledge of violence along with the violence itself that the act of expulsion succeeds in shunting outside the realm of consciousness From the very fact that it belies the overt mythological messages tragic drama opens a vast abyss before the poet but he always draws back at the last moment He is exposed to a form of hubris more dangerous than any contracted by his characters it has to do with a truth that is felt to be infinitely destructive even if it is not fully understoodand its de136 Violence and the Sacred structiveness is as obvious to ancient religious thought as it is to modern philosophers Thus we are dealing with an interdiction that still applies to ourselves and that modern thought has not yet invalidated The fact that this secret has been subjected to exceptional pressure in the play must prompt the following lines May our thoughts never aspire to anything higher than the laws What does it cost man to acknowledge the full sovereignty of the gods That which has always been held as true owes its strength to Nature  G   FOR DIONYSUS AS FOR OEDIPUS the mythic elaboration the transfiguring medium of the story leads to the reorganization of certain elements that properly pertain to collective phenomena anterior to the myth elements that would be wholly unsuitable even unintelligible if they were evenly distributed among the characters if that is the reciprocal nature of the violence were duly acknowledged In both cases reciprocity yields to difference and this difference severs the god or mythic hero from the community while drawing to him all the communitys violent impulses Henceforth the role of violence in the crisisin addition to its function in purely ritualistic or sacrificial termswill be recalled solely as that of a passive agent of contagion the plague in the Oedipus myth or the fraternal nondifferentiation or the Dionysiac bacchanal All the elements that enter into the composition of the myth are borrowed from the reality of the crisis nothing has been added nothing taken away no conscious alterations have been made Mythological elaboration is an unconscious process based on the surrogate victim and nourished by the presence of violence This presence is not repressed not cast off on the unconscious rather it is detached from man and made divine Tragic inspiration dissolves fictive differences in reciprocal violence it demystifies the double illusion of a violent divinity and an innocent community The mixed choruses at the festivals of Dionysus and the temporary permission granted women to drink wine are faint echoes of a more awesome type of intoxication Tragic inspiration demystifies the bacchanal consequently it destroys the delusion based on the collective transference upon which a major portion of the rite depends The rite is not oriented toward violence but toward peace The tragic demystification discloses a bacchanal that is pure frenzy naked violence And the process of tragic demystification is itself violent for it cannot but weaken the rites and contribute to their going wrong Far from toiling in the cause of peace and universal understanding as a world blind to the social role of human violence likes to believe antiDionysus 131 religious demystification is every bit as ambiguous as religion itself If it takes up arms against a certain type of violence it may well bring about another undoubtedly more destructive type Unlike the moderns Euripides confronts this ambiguity head on and that is wrhy he never advances in one direction without subsequendy retracing his steps in another In his oscillations between audacity and timidity he appears to be alternately defending and denouncing the bacchanal At the beginning of the play the bacchanal is presented in a favorable light by Cadmus and Tiresias who both make speeches in praise of Dionysus Euripides seems anxious to defend the cult against those who would associate Dionysiac nondifferentiation with promiscuity and violence The bacchantes are presented as models of tranquillity and decorum and the hostile aspersions cast on the cult are indignantly rejected by the poet The defense of the bacchantes however is immediately belied by events As Marie DelcourtCurvers remarks in her introduction to the play we wonder what meaning the poet intended to give to the antics of Agaue and her companionsinnocent at first to the point of seeming slightly ridiculous then disquieting and finally murderous so that having doubted the very existence of a problem of The Bacchae we are forced to acknowledge both the problem and our inability to resolve it6 The rite may stem from violence and be steeped in violence but it still aspires to peace In fact it is a means of promoting harmony between the members of the community Euripides tried to save the rite from the destruction visited on all religious concepts by sacrificial crises and the tragic mode But this effort was doomed to failure the poets tragic inspiration all too easily overcame his good intentions and once the sacrificial and nonsacrificial have been mixedlike the two drops of Gorgons bloodthere is no separating them The problem of The Bacchae would never have arisen if Euripides had fully acceded to the violent origin of the rite the playing out of violence and had acknowledged the generative act of unanimity preserved by the rite lost in the onslaught of reciprocal violence and recovered through the mechanism of the surrogate victim He could then have demonstrated that the good and bad aspects of the bacchanal correspond to the two faces of the generative act The same creatures who are at each others throats during the course of a sacrificial crisis are fully capable of coexisting before and after the crisis in the relative harmony of a ritualistic order Indeed there would have been no problem if Euripides had been Euripide ed and trans Marie DelcourtCurvers Paris 1962 138 Violence and the Sacred able to adopt the perspective of primitive religion openlv espousing the sacred while stripping man of his violence and reattributing it to divine influences Again there would have been no problem of The Bacchae if the play had been able to bring his perplexities to rest with one of the intermediate positions between the two extremes of the religious solution which transfers the whole burden of violence to the divinity and the unadorned truth which passes the violence back to man In this intermediate system which is the system of modern man the opposition between violent disjunction and peaceful harmonya difference that should unfold in the course of time as a diachronic processis transmuted into a synchronic difference We enter a universe populated by good and evil influencesthe only universe in which we feel truly at home Such a universe is adumbrated in The Bacchae All the elements of its establishment are there the concept of an impious revolt against the gods the partitioning of the gods retinue into authentic Lydian and inauthentic Theban maenads However at the core of the tragic action all distinctions between a good and a bad Dionysiac possessionbetween enthusiasm rewarded as a prize to the faithful and enthusiasm meted out as a punishment to the wickedare effaced The Manichaean division between good and evil is no sooner proposed than it vanishes from sight This division it should be noted is reflected in the continuing hunt for a scapegoat on the cultural and ideological level a hunt that has gone on long after Pentheus met his fate on the slopes of Mount Cithaeron To resolve the problem of The Bacchae we would need to establish a system of differentiation that did not dissolve under scrutiny and that permitted us to affirm the plays literary psychological and moral coherence Such a system would be based once again on recourse to arbitrary violence The foundations of The Bacchae have not been uncovered but they have been soundly shaken It is not Euripides psychological approach that is ultimately responsible for the incoherence of the tragedy its oscillation between audacity and timidity Rather it is the snaking of degrees which Euripides cannot and will not explicitly acknowledge but which blunts all distinctions and multiplies all meanings allowing none of them to remain unshaken The tragedy never succeeds in finding its equilibrium but then there is no place for equilibrium in the drama It is from this that the plays fertile incoherence stemsan incoherence very different from the sterile coherence of lesser works of art intellectuaIly and esDionysus 139 hetically beyond reproach There is no point in trying to resolve the problem of The Bacchae any more than there is in trying to resolve he opposition between the symmetry of the tragic action and the iissymetry of the mythological message in Oedipus the King Ultimately these two problems are one Instead of trying to force tragedy to conform to our trivial and insignificant criterion of coherence we should concentrate on the logical flaws of tragedy and try to penetrate the inviolate interiors of the myths to see how they are put together We must generalize the problem of The Bacckae so that it applies to all culturesreligious and nonreligious primitive and nonprimitive Our problem then will relate to cultures violent origins previously hidden but now discernible in the rapid disintegration of the last sacrificial practices of the modern world     THE PREPONDERANCE OF WOMEN in the Dionvsiac cult remains a subject of conjecture We may well wonder without retracting any of our previous suppositions whether the charges brought against the womentheir responsibility for Pentheuss murder the homicidal frenzy that characterizes their behavior throughout the original bacchanal that is throughout the sacrificial crisisare not every bit as false as the idyllic portrait of the bacchanal at the beginning of the play as a rustic interlude amid the flowers and forests of Cithaeron The two protagonists are male but behind them there are only women and old men Homicidal fury is very real during the crisis but it pertains to the entire community the violence directed against the surrogate victim cannot be limited strictly to the women We may therefore wonder whether the preponderance of women does not constitute a secondary mythological displacement an effort to exonerate from the accusation of violence not mankind as a wrhole but adult males who have the greatest need to forget their role in the crisis because in fact they must have been largely responsible for it They alone risk plunging the community into the chaos of reciprocal violence We can therefore postulate a mythological substitution of women for men in regard to violence That is not to say that the womens link to Mount Cithaeron was pure invention Myths invent nothing but the true meaning of this mass migration of women accompanied by their children and perhaps by old men may well have been as badly distorted by the tragic handling as by pastoral idealizing We are told that the exodus from the city was prompted by divine inspiration and Dionysiac enthusiasm Thus exodus becomes a characteristic trait of the crisis but it is neither a triumphal procession nor an irresistible 140 Violence and the Sacred charge Rather it is likely to have been a frantic flight of those members of the community whose age or sex prevented them from bearing arms The weaker leave the field to the stronger who spread terror throughout the city Anthropological evidence seems to support this hypothesis Napoleon Chagnon describes a festival organized by a number of closely related Yanomamo communities The program of entertainment included a series of chest pounding duels ostensibly of friendly intent and traditional to the occasion At the moment when the imminent defeat of one team threatened to turn the contest into a bloody battle the women and children began to cry knowing that the situation was getting serious and they grouped into the farthest corners of their houses near the exits Shortlv after while the warriors of both factions were preparing for combat and gathering their poisoned arrows the women and children    began fleeing from the village screaming and wailing7 The role played by women in the religious and cultural structure of a societyor rather the minor importance of that roleis graphically illustrated by the social framework prevailing in certain South American villagesin those of Bororo for example8 The village is laid out in the form of an almost perfect circle divided up according to social categories In the center is the mens house entrance is forbidden to women Cultural and religious activities consist for the main part of a complex system of comings and goings confined entirely to the men with the central house serving as a sort of general meeting place The women inhabit the houses on the periphery of the circle and unlike the men they never move to another house This immobility of the women was one of the factors that led early researchers to affirm the existence of a matriarchy In fact far from attesting to womens importance this very stability suggests that women are only passive spectators at a masculine tragicomedy The elegant dance ritual practiced by the men in time of order and tranquillity amounts to a precautionary measure designed to prevent the violent encounters that occur in times of turbulence The physical structure of the Bororo village seems to reflect the centrifugal inclinations of its weakest inhabitants the women by making the center an exclusively masculine preserve This inclination is universal it was observed by Chagnon in its most literal form during the Yanomamo festival and it can be surmised behind the less convincing aspects of the Dionysus myth The motionless groups of women gathered together in the periph7 Napoleon Chagnon Yanomamo the Fierce People New York 1968 p 116 8Cf Claude LeviStrauss Tristes Tropiques trans John Weightman and Doreen Weightman New York 1975 chap 22 Dionysus 141 eral houses bring powerfully to mind the people who cluster on sidewalks or at street corners whenever something is going onusually some dispute or brawl The desire not to miss any part of the show balanced by the desire to remain at a safe distance from the action causes the spectators to form themselves into a circle around the object of interest Psychoanalysts will note of course that the mens house has been inserted like a phallus in the feminine circle but this observation scarcely helps to explain the situation Beyond the sexual symbolism is the violence that gives shape to the events and that literally inscribes itselffirst as a cultural order then as sexuality hidden behind that order and finally and openly as violence which underlies all possible meanings and remains indecipherable as long as any other meaning overlays it Returning to the subject of Dionysus we repeat that the presence of the women outside the city might well represent a real circumstance of the original crisis transfigured by a mythological operation analogous to but distinct from the one we have already analyzed A transfer of violence can be assumed parallel to the one that engenders the god but of less consequence We are dealing here with a mythological elaboration that probably took place early at an epoch when the divinity had not yet absorbed the most violent and repulsive aspects of the sacrificial crisis The characteristic features of the crisis are not yet sufficiently blurred and indistinct for men to be willing to acknowledge them as their own The tendency to attribute to women what is probably a masculine trait of violence can be related to a major thematic motif of The Bacchae the loss of sexual differentiation As we have remarked one of the effects of the sacrificial crisis is a certain feminization of the men accompanied by a masculinization of the women For the idea that men behave like women and women like men is substituted the idea that the sinister Dionysiac practices are almost exclusively womens work The abolishment of sexual differencesfor that matter of all differencesis a reciprocal phenomenon and the mythological redistribution has been carried out as always at the expense of reciprocity The symmetrical elements regroup under a nonsymmetrical form a form reassuring to male dignity and authority for it grants what amounts to a virtual monopoly on Dionysiac delirium to the women Here again tragedy restores lost reciprocity but only partially it does not dare challenge the dominant feminine role in the origins of the Dionysiac rites And if the lost sexual difference makes it easier to shunt the responsibility for violence onto the women it still cannot explain away the necessity for violence Like the animal and the infant but to a lesser degree the woman qualifies for sacrificial status by 142 Violence and the Sacred reason of her weakness and relatively marginal social status That is why she can be viewed as a quasisacred figure both desired and disdained alternately elevated and abused A reading of Greek mythology and tragedy especially the plays of Euripides with particular attention to the possible inversion of the sexes would undoubtedly yield some striking results sy Chapter Six From Mimetic Desire to the Monstrous Double CfSrf IN THE BACCHAE the intervention of the god coin  cides with the loss of generative unanimity and the inevitable slide into reciprocal violence When the transcendental element descends to the human sphere it is reduced to immanence transformed back into mimetic fascination Reciprocal violence now demolishes everything that unanimous violence had erected And as the institutions and interdictions based on generative unanimity perish violence roams at will unchallenged and unchecked The god who has appeared malleable and complaisant a willing servant of mankind always manages to slip away at the last moment leaving destruction in his wake Then the men who sought to bend him to their uses turn on one another with murderous intent In Oedipus the King the tragic conflict still centers at least in appearance on specific concerns the throne of Thebes and the queen who is both mother and wife In The Bacchae by contrast Dionysus and Pentheus have nothing concrete to fight over Their rivalry centers on divinity itself but behind that divinity there lies only violence To compete for divinity is to compete for a chimera because the reality of the divine rests in its transcendental absence It is not the hysterical rivalry of men that will engender godsonly unanimous violence can accomplish that Insofar as divinity is real it cannot serve as a prize to be won in a contest Insofar as it is regarded as a prize it is merely a phantom that will invariably escape mans grasp and turn to violence Every tragic protagonist is fated to pursue this phantom And as soon as one individual attempts to incarnate divine violence rivalries spring up The violence remains reciprocal there is no profit to anyone when only blows are traded The chorus perceives the train of events and scrupulously avoids involving itself in the tragic action We must take care not to view the tragic conflict in terms of its immediate goals even when they are objects of such consequence as a 143 144 Violence and the Sacred throne or a queen The Baccbae teaches us that we must invert the usual order of things in order to appreciate the import of tragic rivalry In the traditional view the object comes first followed by human desires that converge independently on this object Last of all comes violence a fortuitous consequence of the convergence As the sacrificial conflict increases in intensity so too does the violence It is no longer the intrinsic value of the object that inspires the struggle rather it is the violence itself that bestows value on the objects which are only pretexts for a conflict From this point on it is violence that calls the tune Violence is the divine force that everyone tries to use for his own purposes and that ends by using everyone for its ownthe Dionysus of The Baccbae In the light of this knowledge even the preliminary stages of the sacrificial crisis can be seen to reveal the dominant influence of violence Certain scenes of Oedipus the King while less explicit in their violence than those of The Baccbae gain intensity and significance when viewed with the lessons of The Baccbae in mind When Oedipus and Laius meet at the crossroads the fatherson and kingsubject relationship is not initially in question Their encounter begins with a strangers menacing gesture the older man barring the road to the younger one Oedipuss reaction is to strike out at the stranger then at his throne then at his wife that is to strike at the objects belonging to the initiator of violence Only in the end is the aggressor identified as father and king In other words it is violence that bestows value on the violent mans possessions Laius is not violent because he is a father rather it is because of his violence that he passes as a father and a king Is that not what Heraclitus had in mind when he proclaimed that violence is the father and king of all Nothing perhaps could be more banal than the role of violence in awakening desire Our modern terms for this phenomenon are sadism or masochism depending on its manifestations we regard it as a pathological deviation from the norm We believe that the normal form of desire is nonviolent and that this nonviolent form is characteristic of the generality of mankind But if the sacrificial crisis is a universal phenomenon this hopeful belief is clearly without foundation At the very height of the crisis violence becomes simultaneously the instrument object and allinclusive subject of desire This is why social coexistence would be impossible if no surrogate victim existed if violence persisted beyond a certain threshold and failed to be transmuted into culture It is only at this point that the vicious circle of reciprocal violence wholly destructive in nature is replaced by the vicious circle of ritual violence creative and protective in nature From Mimetic Desire to the Monstrous Double 145 At the height of the sacrificial crisis mans desires are focused on one thing only violence And in one way or another violence is always mingled with desire The statement that violence is kinstinctive adds nothing to our understanding of this strange and startling relationship on the contrary it only clouds the issue Today we know that animals possess individual braking mechanisms to insure that combats between them seldom result in the actual death of the vanquished Because such mechanisms tend to assure the perpetuation of the species it would perhaps be not inappropriate to term them instinctive To use the same term in connection with mans lack of such a braking device however would be absurd The notion of an instinct or if one prefers an impulse that propels men toward violence or deathFreuds famous death wishis no more than a last surrender to mythological thinking a final manifestation of that ancient belief that human violence can be attributed to some outside influenceto gods to Fate to some force men can hardly be expected to control Once again it is a mode of thought that refuses to confront human conflicts squarely It is an act of evasion an attempt to pass the buck1 and find an alternate sacrificial solution in a situation which makes such a solution increasingly difficult In the midst of the sacrificial crisis there is no point in attaching desire to any one object no matter how attractive for desire is wholly directed toward violence itself This does not mean however that we must endow man with an instinctive drive toward death or violence There is still another approach open to us In all the varieties of desire examined bv us we have encountered not only a subject and an object but a third presence as well the rival It is the rival who should be accorded the dominant role We must take care however to identify him correctly not to say with Freud that he is the father or in the case of the tragedies that he is the brother Our first task is to define the rivals position within the system to which he belongs in relation to both subject and object The rival desires the same object as the subject and to assert the primacy of the rival can lead to only one conclusion Rivalry does not arise because of the fortuitous convergence of two desires on a single object rather the subject desires the object because the rival desires it In desiring an object the rival alerts the subject to the desirability of the object The rival then serves as a model for the subject not only in regard to such secondary matters as style and opinions but also and more essentially in regard to desires When modern theorists envisage man as a being who knows what he wants or who at least possesses an unconscious that knows for him they may simply have failed to perceive the domain in which human 146 Violence and the Sacred uncertainty is most extreme Once his basic needs are satisfied indeed sometimes even before man is subject to intense desires though he may not know precisely for what The reason is that he desires being something he himself lacks and which some other person seems to possess The subject thus looks to that other person to inform him of what he should desire in order to acquire that being If the model who is apparently already endowed with superior being desires some object that object must surely be capable of conferring an even greater plenitude of being It is not through words therefore but by the example of his own desire that the model conveys to the subject the supreme desirability of the object We find ourselves reverting to an ancient notionmimesisone whose conflictual implications have always been misunderstood We must understand that desire itself is essentially mimetic directed toward an object desired by the model The mimetic quality of childhood desire is universally recognized Adult desire is virtually identical except that most strikingly in our own culture the adult is generally ashamed to imitate others for fear of revealing his lack of being The adult likes to assert his independence and to offer himself as a model to others he invariably falls back on the formula imitate me in order to conceal his own lack of originality Two desires converging on the same object are bound to clash Thus mimesis coupled with desire leads automatically to conflict However men always seem half blind to this conjunction unable to perceive it as a cause of rivalry In human relationships words like sameness and similarity evoke an image of harmony If we have the same tastes and like the same things surely we are bound to get along But what will happen when we share the same desires Only the major dramatists and novelists have partly understood and explored this form of rivalry1 Even Freud treated it in an indirect and distorted fashion as we shall see in the next chapter By a strange but explicable consequence of their relationship neither the model nor the disciple is disposed to acknowledge the inevitable rivalry The model even when he has openly encouraged imitation is surprised to find himself engaged in competition He concludes that the disciple has betrayed his confidence by following in his footsteps As for the disciple he feels both rejected and humiliated judged unworthy by his model of participating in the superior existence the model himself enjoys The reason for these misunderstandings is not hard to grasp The 1 For a discussion of these works see my Deceit Desire and the Novel Baltimore 1965 From Mimetic Desire to the Monstrous Double 147 model considers himself too far above the disciple the disciple considers himself too far below the model for either of them even fleetingly to entertain the notion that their desires are identicalin short that they might indeed be rivals To make the reciprocity complete we need only add that the disciple can also serve as a model even to his own model As for the model no matter how selfsufficient he may appear he invariably assumes the role of disciple either in this context or another From all indications only the role of disciple is truly essentialit is this role that must be invoked to define the basic human condition The mimetic aspects of desire must correspond to a primary impulse of most living creatures exacerbated in man to the point where only cultural constraints can channel it in constructive directions Man cannot respond to that universal human injunction Imitate me without almost immediately encountering an inexplicable counterorder Dont imitate me which really means Do not appropriate my object This second command fills man with despair and turns him into the slave of an involuntary tyrant Man and his desires thus perpetually transmit contradictory signals to one another Neither model nor disciple really understands why one constantly thwarts the other because neither perceives that his desire has become the reflection of the others Far from being restricted to a limited number of pathological cases as American theoreticians suggest the double binda contradictory double imperative or rather a whole network of contradictory imperativesis an extremely common phenomenon In fact it is so common that it might be said to form the basis of all human relationships2 Bateson is undoubtedly correct in believing that the effects of the double bind on the child are particularly devastating All the grownup voices around him beginning with those of the father and mother voices which in our society at least speak for the culture with the force of established authority exclaim in a variety of accents Imitate us Imitate me UI bear the secret of life of true being The more attentive the child is to these seductive words and the more earnestly he responds to the suggestions emanating from all sides the more devastating will be the eventual conflicts The child possesses no perspective that will allow him to see things as they are He has no basis for reasoned judgements no means of foreseeing the metamorphosis of his model into a rival This models opposition reverberates in his mind like a terrible condemnation he can only regard it as an act of excommunication The future orientation of his desiresthat is the choice of 2See Gregory Bateson et al Toward a Theory of Schizophrenia in Steps to an Ecology of the Mind New York 1972 pp 20127 148 Violence and the Sacred his future modelswill be significantly affected by the dichotomies of his childhood In fact these models will determine the shape of his personality If desire is allowed to follow its own bent its mimetic nature will almost always lead it into a double bind The unchanneled mimetic impulse hurls itself blindly against the obstacle of a conflicting desire It invites its own rebuffs and these rebuffs will in turn strengthen the mimetic inclination We have then a selfperpetuating process constantly increasing in simplicity and fervor Whenever the disciple borrows from his model what he believes to be the true object he tries to possess that truth by desiring precisely what this model desires Whenever he sees himself closest to the supreme goal he comes into violent conflict with a rival By a mental shortcut that is both eminently logical and selfdefeating he convinces himself that the violence itself is the most distinctive attribute of this supreme goal Ever afterward violence and desire will be linked in his mind and the presence of violence will invariably awaken desire Perhaps this is why the possessions that serve to symbolize being in Oedipus the Kingthe throne and the queenare behind the strangers angry gesture at the crossroads Violence is the father and king of everything Jocasta affirms this truth in declaring that Oedipus belongs to whomever speaks to him of phobouof unhappiness terror disasters nefarious violence of any sort The oracular pronouncements of Laius Creon and Tiresias and the ill tidings of the messengers emanate from that logos phobou to which all the characters in the myth belong The logos phobou is ultimately the wordless language by which mimetic desire and violence communicate with one another Violent opposition then is the signifier of ultimate desire of divine selfsufficiency of that beautiful totality whose beauty depends on its being inaccessible and impenetrable The victim of this violence both adores and detests it He strives to master it by means of a mimetic counterviolence and measures his own stature in proportion to his failure If by chance however he actually succeeds in asserting his mastery over the model the latters prestige vanishes He must then turn to an even greater violence and seek out an obstacle that promises to be truly insurmountable Mimetic desire is simply a term more comprehensive than violence for religious pollution As the catalyst for the sacrificial crisis it would eventually destroy the entire community if the surrogate victim were not at hand to halt the process and the ritualized mimesis were not at hand to keep the conflictual mimesis from beginning afresh As I have already indicated a little later on I will formally examine the evidence there are all sorts of rules and regulations that prevent desire From Mimetic Desire to the Monstrous Double 149 from floating free and attaching itself to the first model that comes along By channeling its energies into ritual forms and activities sanctioned by ritual the cultural order prevents multiple desires from converging on the same object Notably it protects children from the disastrous effects of the double bind  Q t f  AS THE READER MAY RECALL I have tried to demonstrate that the characters in tragedy are ultimately indistinguishable The words used to describe any one of them in psychological sociological moral or even religious termsfor example hottempered tyrannical hubristicare all equally applicable and equally inadequate If the commentators have failed to remark that these traits are the common property of all the characters in the play it is because they are not all affected by them at the same time Anger for example is always transitory It comes in fits emerging from a background of tranquillitywhich is why it is always referred to as sudden and unexpected Tyranny too is essentially unstable A newcomer can ascend unexpectedly to the very summit of power only to plummet while one of his opponents assumes his lost position In short there is always a tyrant and always an oppressed but the roles alternate There is always one character who is angry but while one of the enemy brothers rants and rages the other may temporarily regain his composure In tragedy everything alternates But we must also reckon with the irresistible tendency of the human spirit to suspend this oscillation to fix attention on one extreme or the other This tendency is strictly speaking mythological in nature It is responsible for the pseudodetermination of the protagonists which in turn transforms revolving oppositions into stable differences The concept of alternation appears in tragedy but it figures there deprived of its reciprocity Paradoxically it becomes a pseudospecification it is presented as the characteristic attitude of a single individual in the play Oedipus for instance proclaims himself the child of Fortune and of Chance We moderns would be inclined to use the word destiny which lends an air of solemnity and individuality17 to the situation and avoids any hint of reciprocity The hold of Fortune tukbe on Oedipus is manifested in a series of highs and lows Fortune was my mother and the years that tracked my life saw me in turn both great and small In the final lines of the play the chorus defines the heros existence in terms of his peri peteiai his reversals of fortune that is in terms once again of alternation It matters little whether these lines were or were not written by Sophocles 150 Violence and the Sacred The definition is correct but it is no more correct for Oedipus than for any other tragic hero That is apparent if we turn our attention from a single play to the whole corpus of tragedy If the tragic heroes are all compared their distinctive traits vanish for they all successively assume the same roles Oedipus is an oppressor in Oedipus the King but the oppressed in Oedipus at Colonus Creon is oppressed in Oedipus the King but becomes the oppressor in Antigone Nobody in short incarnates the true oppressor or the true oppressed and the modern ideological interpretations seriously misconstrue the tragic spirit They relegate the plays to the company of romantic melodrama or American Westerns A static Manichaean confrontation of good guys and bad guys an unyielding rancor that holds fast to its victims has replaced the revolving oppositions of real tragedy and completely overshadowed the concept of the tragic peripeteia Tragedy is interested in reversal as such it cares little for the domains these reversals happen to affect Oedipuss alternating states of anger and serenity for example contribute no less to his portrait as a child of Fortune than do his alternating periods of exile and kingship The different rhythm of these alternations and the disparity between the realms to which they belong are such that we would scarcely think of connecting the two indeed as far as I know traditional criticism has never attempted to do so Yet once our attention has been drawn to the subject we may suspect that every motif in tragedy is governed by an alternating movement and our suspicion is confirmed by close examination It is clear that alternation constitutes a relationship In fact alternation is a fundamental fact of the tragic relationshipwhich is why it can scarcely be considered characteristic of any single individual At first glance the alternation of tragedy may well seem dependent on the object under dispute by the enemy brothers The object itself seems of such importance that its loss of possession entails a radical reversal of status a passage from being to nothingness or from nothingness to being Such is the case for Eteocles and Polyneices who decide to take turns wielding the power they are incapable of dividing between them When Eteocles is king Polyneices is one of his subjects and vice versa However this alternation of objects has little direct connection with tragic action The rhythm of the action is faster and more abrupt it is reflected in the tragic dialogue or stichomythia that is in the exchange of insults and accusations that corresponds to the exchange of blows between warriors locked in single combat As we have noticed the description of the duel between Eteocles and Polyneices in The From Mimetic Desire to the Monstrous Double 151 Phoenician Women takes the place of a tragic dialogue and plays an identical role Whether the violence is physical or verbal an interval of time passes between each blow And each blow is delivered in the hope that it will bring the duel or dialogue to an end constitute the coup de grace or final word The recipient of the blow is thrown momentarily off balance and needs time to pull himself together to prepare a suitable reply During this interval his adversary may well believe that the decisive blow has indeed been struck Victoryor rather the act of violence that permits no responsethus oscillates between the combatants without either managing to lay final claim to it Only an act of collective expulsion can bring this oscillation to a halt and cast violence outside the community Desire as we have seen is attracted to violence triumphant and strives desperately to incarnate this irresistible force Desire clings to violence and stalks it like a shadow because violence is the signifier of the cherished being the signifier of divinity If unanimous violence alone that is violence that spends itself can properly be regarded as generative all the implications it makes manifest and all the differences it succeeds in establishing are intimately associated with the backandforth antagonism that precedes with the oscillation of victory from one combatant to another throughout the sacrificial crisis The fits of vertigo that attend the process stem from this terrible oscillation and they ultimately engulf all perceived reality Everything oscillates with a violence that seems to favor first one then another individual or faction Whatever an initial act of violence seems to settle is invariably subverted by a second act which reorders everything anew As long as violence remains present among men and as long as men pursue it as an absolute as a kind of divinity it will continue its devastating oscillations Euripides Bacckae offers the clue The idea of a contest in which divinity is the prize passing from one contestant to the other with uniformly disastrous results is essential to an understanding of all tragic motifs for the structuring of these motifs is really patterned on the action The reader may protest that we are dealing with an abstraction that the idea of a divine stake or prize identical to violence is foreign to The Bacchae This idea may indeed be only suggested here but no one can deny that it is explicit elsewhere and that it is quintessentiallv Greek Certainly it is quite explicit in Homerthat is in a literary text predating the tragedies There arc several terms in Homer that dramatically illuminate the relationship of violence desire and divinity The most useful perhaps 152 Violence and the Sacred in the context of our discussion is the substantive kudos Kudos is best defined in terms of semidivine prestige of mystical election attained by military victory It was the reward sought by both Greek and Trojan particularly in single combat In his Dictionary of IndoEuropean Institutions Benveniste translates kudos as talisman of supremacy It is the fascination of superior violence Violence strikes men as at once seductive and terrifying never as a simple means to an end but as an epiphany Violence tends to generate unanimity either in its favor or against it And violence promotes imbalance tipping the scales of Destiny in one direction or another At the least success violence begins to snowball becoming finally an irresistible avalanche Those who possess kudos see their strength multiplied a hundredfold those deprived of it discover that they are hopelessly handicapped Kudos passes to the man who strikes the hardest the victor of the moment It belongs to the man who manages to convince others and who believes himself that his violence is completely irresistible The opposition must then exert itself to break the spell cast by this conviction and to wrest the kudos from the enemys grasp When the rivalry becomes so intense that it destroys or disperses all its objects it turns upon itself kudos alone becomes the ultimate object The word is sometimes translated glory but as Benveniste has remarked such a translation ignores the magicoreligious aspects that are fundamental to the term Although the modern world lacks a word for this phenomenon the phenomenon itself is familiar The spiritual effects of triumphant violence are readily apparent in sexual activity in games of skill or chance in athletic matches and in contests and competitions of all kinds For the Greeks the issue of violence carried to its extreme was divinity itself The epithet kudros signifies an attitude of triumphant majesty a demeanor characteristic of the gods Man can enjoy this condition only fleetingly and always at the expense of other men To be a god is to possess kudos forever to remain forever a master unchallenged and unchallangeable That is beyond the reach of mortal man It is the gods who confer kudos on men and the gods who take it away The intermingling of human and divine in human conflicts is so obvious that even Benveniste acknowledges it here in other cases where this mixture is present he tries to separate the human and the divine even though their combination might offer a clue to the process of sacralization As long as the concept of kudos existsthat is as long as there exists a prize eminently desirable and thoroughly abstract that men strive From Mimetic Desire to the Monstrous Double 153 onstantlv to wrest from one anotherthere can be no transcendent orce capable of restoring peace What we are witnessing in this strugle for kudos is the decomposition of the divine brought about by iolent reciprocity When the tide of battle turns against them Homrs warriors sometimes justify their retreat with remarks like Today teus has chosen to bestow kudos on our enemies perhaps tomorrow he vill give it to us This alternation of kudos is identical to the alternaions of tragedy We may even wonder whether the division of the rods into two camps in the Iliad is not a late development The original version may have involved a single god the personification of kudos ftho oscillated from one camp to another depending on the course of battle In some Euripidean tragedies the alternation between high and low is sharply delineated It is linked to a form of violence that is no longer physical but spiritual that inverts the relationship between dominating and dominated In Andromache for instance Hermione treats the heroine with complete disdain insisting on the vast gulf that must separate Neoptolemus lawful wife and queen from his mistress a captive slave at the mercy of her captors Presently however the tragic peripeteia takes place Hermione meets her downfall and becomes in effect the slave of Andromache What god would I invoke At what shrine offer prayers Must I slavishly embrace the knees of a slave Euripides is less interested in the changes of circumstance brought about by the plot than in Hermiones overreaction to these changes The nurse remarks My child I did not hide my disapproval when you gave way to such violent hatred for the Trojan woman nor do I now approve your giving way to panic Overreaction is characteristic of these tragic reversals of fortune Yet the overreactions that actually serve to alter the power structure in the play are drawn from other sources Although no decisive action has taken place while Neoptolemus was away in Delphi a tragic debate has taken place between Hermiones father Menelaus who is determined to kill Andromache and the aged Peleus who stands forth as her champion Peleus gains the upper hand and emerges with kudos The transferal of kudos is not simply a subjective matter though it is not objective either It involves a relationship in which the roles of dominating and dominated are constantly reversed Neither psychological nor sociological interpretations can help us here There is no point 14 Violence and the Sacred in invoking a masterslave dialectic because the situation affords no stability of any sort no synthetic resolution In the end the kudos means nothing It is the prize of a temporary victory an advantage no sooner won than challenged It might be compared to those sporting trophies that are passed from winner to winner and that are really nothing but a title an abstraction To take the metaphor too seriously however would only lead to another mythical and ritualistic distortion Far from subordinating religion to sport or play as does Huizinga in Homo Ludens we must subordinate play to religion and in particular to the sacrificial crisis Play has a religious origin to be sure insofar as it reproduces certain aspects of the sacrificial crisis The arbitrary nature of the prize makes it clear that the contest has no other objective than itself but this contest is regulated in such a manner that in principle at least it can never degenerate into a brutal fight to the finish There is no term in any language that is not accompanied by mythological inflections In the case of kudos the reciprocity of the violence is not relinquished but is muted so as to suggest some joust or tourney Because we see that the prize is worthless we tend to assume that the contest itself no matter how perilous is only a pastime an event of limited interest to the protagonists mere sport To correct this impression it suffices to consider some other psychological terms whose mythological inflections are somewhat different Thymos for instance means soul spirit or anger like the anger of Oedipus At first glance thymos has nothing in common with kudos except for one trait which we would normally consider altogether trivial its alternating character When a man possesses thymos he possesses an irresistible dynamism When thymos is withdrawn he is plunged into anguish and despair Thymos is derived from the verb thuein which means to make smoke to offer sacrifices to act violently to run wild The thymos comes and goes at the bidding of the thuein In fact kudos and thymos represent two different and partial aspects of the same problem It is not some vulgar trophy or secondrate divinity the adversaries are trying to wrest from each others grasp but their very souls their vital force their being Each finds this being reflected in the others violence because their mimetic desires have converged on one and the same object Cyclothymia is the term psychiatrists use to designate the alternating presence and absence of thymos Every case of cyclothymia is characterized by mimetic desire and a strong competitive drive Psychiatrists make the mistake of regarding cyclothymia as an essentially individual phenomenon this is a genuinely mythical misconception identical to From Mimetic Desire to the Monstrous Double 155 he delusion whereby men see all sudden reversals of Destiny all maniestations of divine anger as stemming from the action of a single hero cf Oedipus the King An individual perspective on cyclothymia fields only half the truth In all such cases when one person is high in he favor of fortune another is low and vice versa Modern psychiatry often fails to perceive the basic antagonism inderlying the pathological manifestations of cyclothymia because all races of conflict have vanished The physical violence even the harsh anguage of the tragic confrontation no longer manifests itself the idversary himself has disappeared or appears in a static form that onceals the reality of the agonistic process The conflict seems to take place in a domain far removed from the hurlyburly of competition and strife In our own day literary or artistic creation would qualify as such a domain for the romantic and modern artist generally claims to draw his creations from the purest inner sources from a region uncontaminated by imitation In an age where the tyranny of fashion has never been more absolute the artist proclaims his independence from all outside influence The tragic cyclothymia would engulf an increasing number of individuals if nothing intervened to stop it and would end by plunging the whole community into madness and dissolution Thus we can easily understand the terrified response of the chorus its frantic efforts to remain uninvolved and avoid the contamination of mimetic rivalry The virtues of moderation and common sense so dear to ordinary mortals are openly challenged by the constant shiftings of the tragic situation This timidity of the chorus offends the Romantic sensibilities of modernday intellectuals who are scornful of any reluctance to embrace what is forbidden by custom and law Some will attribute the cautiousness of the Greek chorus to a pusillanimous temperament already at this early date imbued with bourgeois attitudes or else to an arbitrary and merciless superego We must be careful to note however that it is not the sinful act in itself that horrifies the chorus so much as the consequences of this act which the chorus understands only too well The vertiginous oscillations of tragedy can shake the firmest foundations and bring the strongest houses crashing to the ground Fortunatelv even among modern readers there are some who do not hold tragic conformism in scorn certain exceptional individuals who have succeeded through genius and a good deal of pain in arriving at a full appreciation of the tragic concept of peripeteia At the very portals of madness Holderlin paused to question Antigone and Oedipus the King Swept up by the same vertiginous movement that seized the heroes of Sophocles he tried desperately to 156 Violence and the Sacred attain that state of moderate equilibrium celebrated by the chorus The relationship between tragedy and Holderlins madness becomes clear if we accept as literal facts the accounts of his existence set forth in the poets own poems novels essays and letters The premises of madness are sometimes neither more nor less than an exceptional encounter with feelings appropriate to Greek tragedy an increasingly stressful alternation between moments of superhuman exhaltation and hours when only the emptiness and desolation of life holds any illusion of reality The god bestows his presence on the poet only it seems to withdraw it A thin thread of remembrance links these alternating visitations and absences a thread just strong enough to assure the individuals sense of continuity and to sustain those visions of the past that heighten the intoxication of possession but render even more painful the anguish of loss A being who thought himself eternally damned finds himself ecstatically involved in his own resurrection a being who thought himself a god is struck with horror at the revelation of his selfdelusion The god is other and the poet though still alive is little better than a corpse for he has lost all reason for living He is like a sacrificial lamb dumbly submitting to the executioners knife Holderlins god often bears a proper namesometimes the name of the poet himself sometimes that of another Usually that other is at the outset a woman who later assumes the features of a manthe poet Schiller Contrary to what Jean Laplanche asserts there is no essential difference between masculine and feminine attributions3 The idolized antagonist undergoes first a feminine incarnation then a masculine incarnation As the poets correspondence makes clear this substitution is unrelated to any sexual difficulties On the contrary amatory success deprives the sexual domain of its value as a test between the I and the other The constant shifting back and forth from divinity to nothingness in Holderlins relationships with others is expressed in poetic mythic quasireligious terms as well as in a perfectly rational form which is at once the most deceptive and most revealing of all His letters to Schiller lucidly describe the plight of the disciple who sees his model transformed into an obstacle and rival In his Thalia Fragment a first draft for the Hyperion Holderlin writes I imagined that the poverty of our nature would change to abundance when two such wretched creatures men could share one heart a single and indivisible life as if all the ills of our existence were brought about by the dissolution of some primitive unity 3 Jean Laplanche Holderlin et la question du pere Paris 1961 From Mimetic Desire to the Monstrous Double 151 With melancholy rapture I can still sense it thinking of naught but how to find someone to accept the gift of my loving smile of how to give myself to the first passerby    Ah How often I then believed I had encountered and possessed the Ineffable simply by having dared to delve to the very depths of my love How often I believed I had been granted direct access to the divine I called out called again and the poor creature put in an appearance embarrassed ill at ease often even slightly aggressivehe wanted only a little pleasure certainly nothing very demanding What a blind imbecile I was I was seeking pearls from beggars even poorer than myself so very poor so sunken in poverty that they were incapable of judging the extent of their misery and delighted in the rags and tatters which covered their naked bodies    In fact when it seemed to me that the last remnants of my lost life were at stake and when my pride began to revive I found that I had become a mass of unleashed activity and I discovered in myself the omnipotence of despair Whenever my wan and languishing spirit happened to imbibe an unexpected draught of happiness I flung myself precipitously into the midst of the crowd spoke out in inspired tones and sometimes even felt welling up in my eyes the tears of felicity Or whenever the thought of image of a hero flashed across the dark firmament of my soul I rejoiced in my surprise as if a god had seen fit to visit my forlorn domain And it seemed to me then that a whole world was about to take shape within me But the more suddenly these dormant powers were stirred into awakening the more precipitous was their subsequent decline and unsatiated nature experienced a redoubling of afflictions In a letter to Schiller Holderlin writes I have sufficient courage and judgment to free myself from other masters and critics and to pursue my own path with the tranquil spirit necessary for such an endeavor but in regard to you my dependence is insurmountable and because I know the profound effect a single word from you can have on me I sometimes strive to put you out of my mind so as not to be overcome by anxiety at my work For I am convinced that such anxiety such worry is the death or art and I understand perfectly well why it is more difficult to give proper expression to nature when the artist finds himself surrounded by masterpieces than when he is virtually alone amidst the living world He finds himself too closely involved with nature too intimately linked with it to consider the need for rebelling against its authority or for submitting to it But this terrible alternation is almost inevitable when the young artist is exposed to the mature genius of a master which is more forceful and comprehensible than nature and thus more capable of enslaving him It is not a case of one child playing with another childthe primitive equilibrium attained between the first artist and his world no longer holds The child is now 158 Violence and the Sacred dealing with men with whom he will never in all probability be familiar enough to forget their superiority And if he feels this superiority he must become either rebellious or servile Or must he    When differences begin to shift back and forth the cultural order loses its stability all its elements constantly exchange places So it is that in tragedy the differences between the antagonists never vanish entirely but are constantly inverted In such a system enemy brothers can never occupy the same position at the same time Earlier I defined this system in terms of abolished distinctions of symmetry and reciprocity Now I am saying that differences never really disappear The contradiction between the two definitions is I trust a contradiction in appearance only In a tragedy the reciprocal relationship between the characters is real but it is the sum of nonreciprocal moments The antagonists never occupy the same positions at the same time to be sure but they occupy these positions in succession There is never anything on one side of the system that cannot be found on the other side provided we wait long enough The quicker the rhythm of reprisals the shorter the wait The faster the blows rain down the clearer it becomes that there is no difference between those who strike the blows and those who receive them On both sides everything is equal not only the desire the violence the strategy but also the alternation of victory and defeat of exaltation and despair Everywhere we encounter the same cyclothymia My original definition therefore holds and I trust that the concept of shifting differences serves to refine it After all it is not the elimination of differences that lends itself to direct observation but the successive inversion of differences In the temporal plan of the system there is not a moment when those involved in the action do not see themselves separated from their rivals by formidable differences When one of the brothers assumes the role of father and king the other cannot but feel himself to be the disinherited son That explains why the antagonists only rarely perceive the reciprocal nature of their involvement Each is too intensely engaged in living out his nonreciprocal moment to grasp the whole picture to take in several of these moments in a single glance and compare them in such a way as to penetrate the illusory quality of singularity that each moment observed in isolation seems to possessin a universe that otherwise appears commonplace banal without interest The same characters who are blind to the phenomenon of reciprocity while they are caught up in it perceive it all too well when they are not involved That is why during the sacrificial crisis all men are endowed with the spirit of From Mimetic Desire to the Monstrous Double 159 prophecya vainglorious wisdom that deserts them when they themselves are put to the test Because they are essentially outsiders and therefore misread the differences shifting back and forth between the antagonists Oedipus Creon and Tiresias in turn imagine themselves capable of banishing the plaguethat is of serving as arbitrator in the conflicts convulsing Thebes Each thinks that he can make it clear to the antagonists that no difference actually stands between them And each in turn is drawn into the conflict whose contagiousness he failed to comprehend From within the system only differences are perceived from without the antagonists all seem alike From inside sameness is not visible from outside differences cannot be seen Only the outside perspective which takes into consideration reciprocity and unity and denies the difference can discern the workings of the violent resolution the cryptic process by which unanimity is reformed against and around the surrogate victim When all differences have been eliminated and the similarity between two figures has been achieved we say that the antagonists are doubles It is their interchangeability that makes possible the act of sacrificial substitution My reading of Oedipus the King is based on this outside perspective on an objectivity that takes in at a glance the identity of all the antagonists However the generative unanimity does not come from outside It is produced by the antagonists themselves to whom the objective outlook is utterly alien The preceding description then cannot be sufficient In order for violent unanimity to become a possibilityin order that is for the sacrificial substitution to function their own identity and reciprocity must somehow impose themselves on the antagonists themselves and triumph within the confines of the system Both the outside and inside viewpoints must communicate yet remain distinct the misapprehension must remain within the system for otherwise the polarization of violence onto the surrogate victim could not be effected and the arbitrary choice of that victim would be too readily evident We must be prepared therefore to start our analysis afresh and try to examine from within the mechanism responsible for sacrificial substitution in the crisisridden communitv As I have said the differences that seem to separate the antagonists shift ever faster and more abruptly as the crisis grows in intensity Beyond a certain point the nonreciprocal moments succeed each other with such speed that their actual passage becomes blurred They seem to overlap forming a composite image in which all the previous highs and lows the extremes that had previously stood out in bold relief now seem to intersect and mingle Where formerly he had seen 160 Violence and the Sacred his antagonist and himself as incarnations of unique and separate moments in the temporal scheme of things the subject now perceives two simultaneous projections of the entire rime spanan effect that is almost cinematographic Up to this point I have described the system in terms of single unique difference the difference between the god and the nongod This is clearly an oversimplification The Dionysiac state of mind can and as we have seen often does erase all manner of differences familial cultural biological and natural The entire everyday world is caught up in the whirl producing a hallucinatory state that is not a synthesis of elements but a formless and grotesque mixture of things that are normally separate It is this monstrosity this extraordinary strangeness of the world that captures the attention not only of the characters involved but also of latterday scholars who till the fields of folklore and psychiatry An attempt is made to classify the monsters but despite their initial disparities they end by resembling one another no stable difference really serves to separate them And there is really nothing very interesting to say about the hallucinatory aspects of an experience that for all practical purposes exists solely to divert attention from the essential fact which is that the antagonists are truly doubles A fundamental principle often overlooked is that the double and the monster are one and the same being The myth of course emphasizes only one aspect usually the monstrous aspect in order to minimize the other There is no monster who does not tend to duplicate himself or to marry another monster no double who does not yield a monstrous aspect upon close scrutiny4 The duality claims precedencewithout however eliminating the monstrous and in the duality of the monster the true structure of the experience is put in relief The nature of the relationship between monster and double stubbornly denied by the antagonists is ultimately imposed on them in the course of the shifting of differencesbut it is imposed in the form of a hallucination The unity and reciprocity that the enemy brothers have rejected in the benign form of brotherly love finally impose themselves both from without and within in the form of monstrous dualitythe most disquieting and grotesque form imaginable We can expect little help from literature and even less from medi4 The hysterical experience of the four lovers in A

its reciprocal charicter its affinity with violence Psychoanalysts and folklorists declare that these hallucinatory phenomena are purely imaginary They refuse to acknowledge the reality of the symmetry that underlies the fantasy This transformation of the real into the unreal is part of the process by which man conceals from himself the human origin of his own violence by attributing it to the gods To say that the monstrous double is a god or that he is purely imaginary is to say the same thing in different terms Our abstract skepticism visavis religion serves admirably to fill the function formerly performed by religion itself To mv knowledge only Dostoevsky both in his early novel The Double and in the masterpieces of his maturity has set forth in concrete terms the elements of reciprocity at work in the proliferation of monsters In the collective experience of the monstrous double the differences are not eliminated but muddied and confused All the doubles are interchangeable although their basic similarity is never formally acknowledged They thus occupy the equivocal middle ground between difference and unity that is indispensable to the process of sacrificial substitutionto the polarization of violence onto a single victim who substitutes for all the others The monstrous double gives the antagonists incapable of perceiving that nothing actually stands between them or their reconciliation precisely what they need to arrive at the compromise that involves unanimity minus the victim of the generative expulsion The monstrous double all monstrous

quick you smiling Bacchant and cast your fatal net about this man who dares to hunt you Maenads We can now appreciate the atmosphere of terror and hallucination that accompanies the primordial religious experience When violent hysteria reaches a peak the monstrous double looms up everywhere at once The decisive act of violence is directed against this awesome vision of evil and at the same time sponsored by it The turmoil then gives way to calm hallucinations vanish and the detente that follows only heightens the mystery of the whole process In an instant all extremes have met all differences fused superhuman exemplars of 162 Violence and the Sacred violence and peace have in that instant coincided Modern pathological experiences offer no such catharsis but although religious and pathological experiences cannot be equated they share certain similarities  Q  4 M  N Y LITERARY TEXTS both ancient and modern make reference to the double to duality to double visionreferences that have long been disregarded In The Bacchae the monstrous double is everywhere As we have seen from the opening of the play animal human and divine are caught up in a frenetic interchange beasts are mistaken for men or gods gods and men mistaken for beasts Perhaps the most intriguing instance of this confusion occurs during the encounter between Dionysus and Pentheus shortly before Pentheus is murderedthat is at the very moment when the enemy brother is due to disappear behind the form of the monstrous double And that is exactly what happens Pentheus has already fallen prey to Dionysiac vertigo he sees double Pentheus I seem to see two suns two Thebes with two times seven gates And you you are a bull walking before rne with two horns sprouting from your head Dionysus You see what you ought to see In this extraordinary exchange the theme of the double appears initially in a form completely exterior to the subject as a double vision of inanimate objects an attack of dizziness Here we are dealing solely with hallucinatory elements they are undeniably a part of the experience but only a part and not the essential one As the passage unfolds so too does its meaning Pentheus associates the double vision with the vision of the monster Dionysus is at once man god and bull The reference to the bulls horns links the two themes doubles are always monstrous and duality is always an attribute of monsters Dionysuss words are arresting You see ivhat you ought to see By seeing double by seeing Dionysus himself as a monster bearing the double seal of duality and bestiality Pentheus conforms to the immutable rules of the game Master of the game the god makes sure that events take their course according to his plan The plan is identical to the process we have just described with the monstrous double making his appearance at the height of the crisis just before the unanimous resolution These lines become even more intriguing when read in conjunction with the passage that follows Now we have to reckon not with hallucination or vertigo but with real flesh and blood doubles The identical nature of the antagonists is explicidy formulated From Mimetic Desire to the Monstrous Double 163 Fentheus Tell me who do I look like Like Ino or like my mother Agaue Dionysus You seem the very image of them both Similarities are at the heart of the encounter but the question is treated ambiguously in terms of family resemblancea formulation brought to mind by Pentheus transvestite masquerade Yet something more is clearly at stake here Surely it is the similarity of doubles that is being suggested that of the surrogate victim and the community that expells it of the sacrificed and the sacrificer All differences are abolished You seem the very image of them both once again it is the god himself who confirms the basic principles of a process initiated by him and which in fact comes to seem a sign of his presence  Q A j  THE WRITINGS OF ANOTHER ANCIENT AUthor are equally vital I believe to a discussion of the monstrous double Empedocles description of the birth of monsters has never been adequately interpreted However if the cycles described by the philosopher correspond to a cultural system founded on an act of generative violence maintained by ritual and destroyed by a new sacrificial crisis then we can scarcely doubt that the birth of monsters as described by him is meant to suggest terrible apparition of the monstrous double The author attributes the cyclical movement to the alternation of two fundamental impulses Love and Hate The birth of monsters come about through the attraction of like for like under the aegis not of Love but of Hate before the birth of a nenx world 57 Then there began to sprout in profusion heads without necks and arms without bodies or shoulders swarmed everywhere and naked eyes floated as planets in the world of Hate 58 The dismembered limbs subservient to the will of Hate wander about separately yearning to unite 59 But as soon as a god draws closer in harmony to another god the limbs begin to link up at random and they all rush together 60 We find creatures with revolving legs and coundess hands 61 Others are born with two faces two torsos there are cows with human heads and men with the heads of cows and hermaphrodites whose sex is shrouded in mystery The interpretation I propose happens to coincide with the recent tendency to reject physical interpretations of preSocratic thought interpretations that are to be sure always dependent on the belief that the primary purpose of myths is to explain natural phenomena Although the more recent interpretations are superior to the early ones 164 Violence and the Sacred they still I believe underestimate the religious element in the thinking of Empedocles and indeed in all the preSocratics My attempt to link the passage from Empedocles with the phenomenon of the monstrous double may seem less farfetched if we consider this passage in conjunction with another work of Empedocles Purifications I alluded to this work earlier on but it seems to take on new significance in this context The father takes hold of his son who has changed form and in a fit of madness sacrifices him the son cries out but his pleas fall on deaf ears the demented father cuts the sons throat and prepares an abominable feast in his palace Similarly the son seizes the father and the children of their mother kills them all and devours their flesh Whether or not we choose to take this passage literally it underscores the atmosphere of acute sacrificial crisis that was the background for Empedocles work The father kills his son who has changed form just as Agaue kills her son who has changed form mistaking him for a lion and just as Pentheus mistakes Dionysus for a bull As in The Bacchae we are witnessing the degeneration of a rite into a form of reciprocal violence that is so irrational it conjures up the monstrous double That is it harkens back to the very origins of the rite and thus closes the circle of religious compositions and decompositions that preoccupied the preSocratics  G   THE APPARITION OF THE MONSTROUS DOUble cannot be verified empirically nor for that matter can the body of phenomena that forms the basis for any primitive religion Despite the texts cited above the monstrous double remains a hypothetical creation as do the other phenomena associated with the mechanism that determines the choice of surrogate victim The validity7 of the hypothesis is confirmed however by the vast number of mythological ritualistic philosophical and literary motifs that it is able to explain as well as by the quality7 of the explanations by the coherence it imposes on phenomena that until now appeared isolated and obscure My hypothesis permits me to essay an explanation of two sets of phenomena that are among the most puzzling in all human culture possession and the ritual use of masks Under the heading monstrous double we shall group all the hallucinatory phenomena provoked at the height of the crisis by unrecognized reciprocity The monstrous double is also to be found wherever we encounter an I and an Other caught up in a constant interchange of differences The same set of images is projected almost simultaneously in two symmetrical locations In The Bacchae we discover two types of phenomena that are capable of rapid interchange From Mimetic Desire to the Monstrous Double 165 The subject of the action Pentheus at first sees the two series of images as exterior to himself this is the phenomenon of double vision A moment later one of the two series is perceived as not me and the other as me It is this second experience we are referring to wrhen we use the term double It is a direct extension of the previous stages and it retains the concept of an antagonist exterior to the subjecta concept crucial to an understanding of possession The subject watches the monstrosity that takes shape within him and outside him simultaneously In his efforts to explain what is happening to him he attributes the origin of the apparition to some exterior cause Surely he thinks this vision is too bizarre to emanate from the familiar country within too foreign in fact to derive from the world of men The whole interpretation of the experience is dominated by the sense that the monster is alien to himself The subject feels that the most intimate regions of his being have been invaded by a supernatural creature who also besieges him without Horrified he finds himself the victim of a double assault to which he cannot respond Indeed how can one defend oneself against an enemy who blithely ignores all barriers between inside and outside This extraordinary freedom of movement permits the godor spirit or demonto seize souls at will The condition called possession is in fact but one particular interpretation of the monstrous double It is hardly surprising that possession should often take the form of a hysterical mimesis The subject seems to be responding to some outside influence he has the jerky movements of a marionette Some presence seems to be acting through hima god a monster or whatever creature is in the process of investing his body He is caught in the double bind of the modelobstacle that condemns both partners to a continual heightening of violence The monstrous double now takes the place of those objects that held the attention of the antagonists at a less advanced stage of the crisis replacing those things that each had sought to assimilate and destroy to incarnate and expel Possession then is an extreme form of alienation in which the subject totally absorbs the desires of another The possessed subject bellows like Dionysus the bull like a lion he is ready to devour anyone who ventures within sight He can even impersonate inanimate objects He is at the same time one and many beings as he reenacts the hysterical trance and the crazy mixture of differences that immediately precedes the collective expulsion There exist entire sects devoted to possession with their own group sessions It is interesting to note that in colonial countries or oppressed societies it is often the representatives of the dominant powerthe governorgeneral or the sentry at the barracks gatewho serve as models 166 Violence and the Sacred Possession like everything pertaining to primordial religious experience tends to acquire a ritual character The existence of a ritual form of possession implies that something in the nature of an intense case of collective possession took place initially for it is of course that spontaneous occurrence that the ritual is striving to reproduce Ritual possession seems inseparable at first from the sacrificial rites that serve as its culmination In principle the religious practices follow the order of the cycle of violence they are attempting to imitate Such is the case with the Dinka in those occasional instances in which possession precedes the immolation of the victim As soon as the excitement aroused by the chants dances and mock combats has reached a certain pitch of intensity the ritual imprecations pass over into signs of possession As Lienhardt recounts it5 first young men then adult men and women are overcome They stagger about among their companions then fall to the ground in convulsions moaning or emitting piercing cries In some sects possession is regarded as beneficial in others as harmful And there are still others that consider possession beneficial or harmful depending on the circumstances Behind these diverse attitudes lies a problem of interpretation similar to the one we have discussed in connection with ritual incest and with festivals In dealing with liberating violence religion can choose either faithfully to reenact the all too characteristic phenomena of the crisis or systematically to ignore them The phenomenon of possession therefore can appear as sickness cure or both at once As the rites disintegrate some of the elements that formed them tend to disappear Others assume new identities divorced from their past context Possessions like many other aspects of primordial experience can become the chief object of religious preoccupation In such cases possession cults arise The group sessions of the cult find their climax in an act of sacrificial slaughter6 At a later stage of the cult the sacrifice disappears from the rites The shamans then try to utilize possession for rnagicomedical purposes They become specialists in the practice of possession K3 STILL ANOTHER RITUAL PRACTICE acquires fresh significance in the light of investigations into the monstrous double the ritual use of masks Masks are among the necessary tools of many primitive sects but we cannot answer with certainty the questions raised by their presence What do they represent What is their purpose How did they originate Surely there must be some unifying factor some criterion for 5 Godfrey Lienhardt Divinity and Experience pp 13637 274 et passim 6Cf Jeanmaires description of the Zar and Bori Dionysos pp 11931 From Mimetic Desire to the Monstrous Double 161 masks among the great variety of forms and styles something we can recognize if not define After all whenever we encounter a mask we do not hesitate to identify it as such The unity of the mask cannot be extrinsic it exists in societies remote from each other in space and culture and it cannot be traced to a single geographical locus The almost universal use of masks is often said to answer some deepseated esthetic need Primitive people we are told are obsessed with disguises they also have a compulsion to create forms This kind of art criticism offers no real answer to the problem of masks Primitive art after all is fundamentally religious And masks will undoubtedly therefore serve a religious function They are certainly not pure inventions their models vary greatly from culture to culture but certain traits remain constant Although it would not be correct to say that masks invariably represent the human face they are almost always associated with it designed to cover the face to replace it or in some way to substitute for it The problem of the unity and diversity of masks is the same as that of the unity and diversity of myths and rituals It undoubtedly originates in some real experience common to a large portion of humanity but now lost to us Like the festival in which it often plays an important role the mask displays combinations of forms and colors incompatible with a differentiated order that is not primarily that of nature but of the culture itself The mask mixes man and beast god and inanimate object Victor Turner makes reference to a ndembu mask that represents at once a human face and a meadow7 iMasks juxtapose beings and objects separated by differences They are beyond differences they do not merely defy differences or efface them but they incorporate and rearrange them in original fashion In short they are another aspect of the monstrous double The ritual ceremonies that require the use of masks are reenactments of the original experience In many cases the celebrants at least those who play the most important role in the ceremony don masks at the climax of the rite just before the sacrifice These rites permit the participants to play out all the roles performed by their ancestors during the original crisis They are enemies first engaging in mock combats and symmetrical dances then they put on their masks and change into monstrous doubles The mask is no apparition drawn from the thin air it is a transformation of the antagonists normal features The different modes of its ritual use the structure within which the masks operate are in most cases more revealing than any terms their 7 Victor Turner The Forest of Symbols Aspects of Ndembu Ritual Ithaca NY 1970 p 105 168 Violence and the Sacred wearers may use to describe them If the mask is intended to conceal human faces at a fixed point in the ritual that is because this is what happened to human faces the first time Masks then serve as an interpretation and concrete representation of phenomena that we described previously in purely theoretical terms There is no point in trying to determine whether masks represent human or supernatural beings An inquiry of that kind is relevant only to later developments of the ritual brought about by a further accentuation of differences a deepening misapprehension of the phenomena that the ritualistic use of masks allows the wearers to reenact Masks stand at that equivocal frontier between the human and the divine between a differentiated order in the process of disintegration and its final undifferentiated statethe point where all differences all monstrosities are concentrated and from which a new order will emerge There is no point in trying to determine the nature of masks because it is in their nature not to have a nature but to encompass all natures Greek tragedy like the festival and indeed all other rites is primarily a representation of the sacrificial crisis and the generative violence The use of masks in the Greek theater requires therefore no special explanation the masks serve the same role as they do elsewhere Masks disappear when the monsters once again assume human form when tragedy completely forgets its ritual origins That is not to say of course that tragedy ceases to play a sacrificial role in the broad sense On the contrary it has taken over the role of ritual GS3 Chapter Seven Freud and the Oedipus Complex c   g y l  WE CAN OBSERVE both similarities and differences   J  N  between the mimetic desire described in the previous chapter and Freuds Oedipus complex Mimetism is a source of continual conflict By making one mans desire into a replica of another mans desire it invariably leads to rivalry and rivalry in turn transforms desire into violence Although Freud may appear on first glance to have ignored this mechanism he in fact came very close to apprehending it A rigorous examination of this text will make it clear why he ultimately failed to do so The mimetic nature of desire plays an important role in Freuds worknot important enough however to dominate and revolutionize his thinking His mimetic intuitions are incompletely formulated they constitute a dimension of his text that is only half visible and tends to disappear in transmission There is nothing surprising about the refusal of presentday psychoanalysts to turn their attention to this subject Factions of psychoanalytic thought bitterly opposed in other respects are here at one The mimetic aspect of desire has been ignored at once by those whose main concern is the elimination of inconsistencies in Freuds work in favor of a unified whole and by that other group who while orthodox Freudians in name quietly reject some of the most lucid and cogent of Freuds analyses on the grounds that they are tainted with psychologism Although traces of the mimetic conception are scattered through Freuds work this conception never assumes a dominant role It runs counter to the Freudian insistence on a desire that is fundamentally directed toward an object that is sexual desire for the mother When the tension between these opposing tendencies becomes too great both Freud and his disciples seem to resolve it in favor of the objectdesire The mimetic intuition of Freud gives rise to a series of concepts ambiguous in definition obscure in status and vague in function Among the offshoots of this illdefined mimetic desire are certain con169 110 Violence and the Sacred cepts that come under the heading identification Among the categories of Freudian identification one that nowadays receives little attention is the first one discussed in the chapter entitled Identification in Group Psychology and the Afialysis of the Ego This category has to do with the father A little boy will exhibit a special interest in his father he would like to grow like and be like him and take his place everywhere We may say simply that he takes his father as his ideal This behavior has nothing to do with a passive or feminine attitude towards his father and towards males in general it is on the contrary typically masculine It fits in very well with the Oedipus complex for which it helps to prepare the way1 There is a clear resemblance between identification with the father and mimetic desire both involve the choice of a model The choice is not really determined by parentage for the child can select as model any man who happens to fill the role that our society normally assigns to the natural father As we have pointed out in the previous chapter the mimetic model directs the disciples desire to a particular object by desiring it himself That is why we can say that mimetic desire is rooted neither in the subject nor in the object but in a third party whose desire is imitated by the subject Granted the passage quoted above is hardly explicit on this point But its implications are clear and conform to our definition of mimetic desire Freud asserts that the identification has nothing passive or feminine about it a passive or feminine identification would mean that the son wanted to become the object of his fathers desire How then will the active and typically masculine identification realize itself Either it is wholly imaginary or it finds concrete form in the desire for some particular object The identification is a desire to be the model that seeks fulfillment naturally enough by means of appropriation that is by taking over the things that belong to his father As Freud says the son seeks to take the father s place everywhere he thus seeks to assume his desires to desire what the father desires The proof that we are not distorting Freuds intention is supplied by the last sentence of the passage The identification fits very well with the Oedipus complex for which it helps to prepare the way What can this sentence mean if not that identification directs desire toward those objects desired by the father We have here an undeniable instance of filial desire undergoing the influence of mimesis Con1 Sigmund Freud The Standard Edition of the Complete Psychological Works of Sigtmtnd Freud ed and trans James Strachey 24 vols London 195366 vol 18 Group Psychology and the Afialysis of the Ego p 105 Freud and the Oedipus Complex 111 sequently there already exists in Freuds thought at this stage a latent conflict between this mimetic process of paternal identification and the autonomous establishment of a particular object as a basis for desire the sexual cathexis toward the mother This conflict is all the more apparent because identification with the father is presented as fundamental to the boys development anterior to aiy choice of object Freud emphasizes this point in the opening sentences of an analysis that will eventually unfold into an overall description of the Oedipus complex and that is to be found in the chapter on identification previously referred to2 After identification with the father comes the sexual cathexis toward the mother which according to Freud first appears and develops independently The objectchoice of the mother appears to have its origins in two factors first the identification with the father the mimesis second the fixation of the libido on the mother These two forces act together and reinforce one another as Freud makes clear a few lines further on After having subsisted side by side for a time without any mutual influence or interference the two come together at last and the libidinal drive is thereby strengthened This is a wholly natural and logical turn of events if we choose to regard this identification as the mimesis of paternal desire Indeed once we have seen matters in this light all other explanations seem irrelevant 1 am not trying to put words in Freuds mouth In fact it is my contention that Freud saw the path of mimetic desire stretching out before him and deliberately turned aside One need only examine his definition of the Oedipus complex which follows a few lines further on to see how he evades the issue The little boy notices that his father stands in his way with his mother His identification with his father takes on a hostile colouring and becomes identical with the wish to replace his father in regard to his mother as well Identification in fact is ambivalent from the very first 3 The passage contains at least one point well worth noting When as Freud explains the son discovers that his father is becoming an obstacle to him his identification fuses with his desire to replace his father in regard to his mother as well That as well rivets the attention Freud has earlier defined identification as the desire to replace the father and he now repeats that formula Must we therefore conclude that the mother was initially excluded implicitly or explicitly from the program On examining the definition we see nothing that suggests such an exclusion quite the contrary As Freud has put 2 Ibid 3 Ibid 112 Violence and the Sacred it The little boy will exhibit a special interest in his father he would like to growr like and be like him and take his place everywhere italics added The casual reader may well assume that the uas well in the phrase in regard to the mother as well is merely a slip of the pen after all if the son wants to replace his father everywhere it follows that he would want to replace him in regard to the mother But this apparent triviality in phrasing conceals an important point As we have seen it is impossible to elucidate Freuds theory of identification without encountering a mimetic mechanism that makes the father into the desiremodel It is the father who directs the sons attention to desirable objects by desiring them himself thus the boys desires are inevitably directed toward his own mother This much is clearly implied by Freuds text yet these conclusions are never made explicit Of course it is possible that they never took shape in his mind though they must surely have hovered there in some form when he was writing the opening passages of chapter 7 Identification Having first implied a mimetic interpretation Freud then rejected it also by implication with the phrase his mother as well Such is the hidden meaning of that as well The two words retrospectively neutralize any mimetic interpretation of identification at least in regard to the object of primary importancethe mother Freuds eagerness to dispell the mimetic elements that were impinging on his Oedipus theory can readily be discerned in his later work Here for instance is his definition of the Oedipus complex as stated in The Ego and the Id 1923 At a very early age the little boy develops an objectcathexis for his mother     the boy deals with his father by identifying himself with him For a time these two relationships proceed side by side until the boys sexual wishes in regard to his mother become more intense and his father is perceived as an obstacle to them from this the Oedipus complex originates His identification with his father then takes on a hostile colouring and changes into a wish to get rid of his father in order to take his place with his mother Henceforward his relation to his father is ambivalent it seems as if the ambivalence inherent in the identification from the beginning had become manifest4 At first glance this looks like a faithful resume of the concepts set forth in Group Psychology and the Analysis of the Ego A further examination reveals certain differences that though apparently minor are in reality very important My previous analysis dealt specifically with the mimetic elements to be found in the earlier text It is precisely 4 Freud Standard Edition vol 19 The Ego and the Id pp 3132 Freud and the Oedipus Complex 775 those elements relegated to the shadows in that earlier description of the Oedipus complex that are banished entirely from this later definition In the earlier text Freud insists on the anteriority of the identification with the father In the later text he does not explicitly repudiate this doctrine but he gives first mention to the sons sexual attraction to the mother In short he discourages us from thinking that one and the same impulsethe wish to take the fathers place everywherestimulates identification with the model and directs desire toward the mother That this inversion of the original order is not a matter of chance becomes abundantly clear when the process is repeated a little further on In the second text we find that the formulation of the complex is preceded by the reinforcement of the sexual wish but instead of presenting this reinforcement as a consequence of the boys first identification with the father Freud inverts the order of the phenomena thereby formally rejecting the causeandeffect relationship suggested initially This reinforcement of the libido is now totally lacking in motivation The effect is retained but because it now precedes the cause neither cause nor effect seems to make much sense As we can see in The Ego and the Id Freud makes a clean sweep of all mimetic effects but in so doing he sacrifices some of the most trenchant insights of Group Psychology and the Analysis of the Ego and some of his coherence as well Why did Freud banish mimesis from his later work The best way to reply to this question is to continue along the path abandoned by him to discover where he might have gone had he chosen to be guided by those mimetic effects that abounded in his earher analyses but that were swept away as if by magic the instant they were found to cast doubt on his Oedipus complex We must in short return to that phrase that is surreptitiously contradicted and canceled out by the mother as well To identify with the father Freud informed us is first of all to want to replace him the little boy would like to grow like and be like him and take his place everywhere italics added In order to exclude the mother from this everywhere it is necessary to assume that the son is already conscious of the law and that he conforms to it without any prior instruction for in principle it is the father who is supposed to teach him But to exclude the mother is in actuality to assert that the Oedipus complex is already in operation if that is not true the mother should be included and that is what Freud has doneinitially The comprehensiveness of the statement that the son wishes to take his fathers place everywhere is wholly appropriate for the son cannot have a clear and distinct impression of 174 Violence and the Sacred his fathers objectsincluding the motherinsofar as they are indeed his fathers In short if the son turns toward his fathers objects it is because he is following the example of his model and this model necessarily turns toward his own objectsthose that are already in his possession or that he hopes to acquire The disciples movement toward the objects of his model including the mother is already accounted for by the concept of identification as defined by Freud Far from discouraging such an interpretation Freud seems initially to have encouraged it Because disciple and model are converging on the same object a clash between them is inevitable The resulting rivalry appears Oedipal but it takes on a wholly different meaning Because it is predetermined by the models choice there is nothing fortuitous about it nor is it strictly speaking a question of one persons usurping what belongs to the other The disciples attraction to the models object is wholly innocent in seeking to take his fathers place with his mother as well the son is simply responding in all candor to a command issued by the culture in which he lives and by the model himself If we pause to consider closely the modeldisciple relationship it should become clear that the socalled Oedipal rivalry reinterpreted in terms of a radically mimetic situation must logically result in consequences that are at once similar to and quite different from those attributed by Freud to his complex Earlier on I defined the effects of mimetic rivalry and affirmed that they invariably end in reciprocal violence This reciprocity is the result of a process If there is a stage in human existence at which reciprocity is not yet in operation and at which reprisals are impossible that stage is surely early childhood That is why children are so vulnerable The adult is quick to sense a violent situation and answer violence with violence the child on the other hand never having been exposed to violence reaches out for his models objects with unsuspecting innocence Only an adult could interpret the childs actions in terms of usurpation Such an interpretation comes from the depths of a cultural system to which the child does not yet belong one that is based on cultural concepts of which the child has not the remotest notion The modeldisciple relationship precludes by its very nature that sense of equality that would permit the disciple to see himself as a possible rival to the model The disciples position is like that of a worshiper before his god he imitates the others desires but is incapable of recognizing any connection between them and his own desires In short the disciple fails to grasp that he can indeed enter into competition with his model and even become a menace to him If this is Freud and the Oedipus Complex 115 true for adults how much truer it must be for the child experiencing his first encounter with mimetic desire The models very first nohowever softly spoken or cautiously phrasedcan easily be mistaken by the disciple for an irrevocable act of excommunication a banishment to the realms of outer darkness Because the child is incapable of meeting violence with violence and has in fact had no real experience with violence his first encounter with the mimetic double bind may well leave an indelible impression The father projects into the future the first tentative movements of his son and sees that they lead straight to the mother or the throne The incest wish the patricide wish do not belong to the child but spring from the mind of the adult the model In the Oedipus myth it is the oracle that puts such ideas into Laiuss head long before Oedipus himself was capable of entertaining any ideas at all Freud reinvokes the same ideas which are no more valid than Laiuss The son is always the last to learn that what he desires is incest and patricide and it is the hypocritical adults who undertake to enlighten him in this matter The first intervention by the model between the disciple and the object is a traumatic experience because the disciple is incapable of performing the intellectual operation assigned him by the adult and in particular by Freud himself He fails to see the model as a rival and therefore has no desire to usurp his place Even the adult disciple is unable to grasp that conflict with the model is indeed rivalry is unable to perceive the symmetry of their situation or acknowledge their basic equality Faced with the models anger the disciple feels compelled to make some sort of choice between himself and the model and it is perfectly clear that he will choose in favor of the model The idols wrath must be justified and it can only be justified by some failure on the part of the disciple some hidden weakness that obliges the god to forbid access to the holy of holies to slam shut the gates of paradise Far from reducing the divinitys prestige this new attitude of vengeful spite serves to increase it The disciple feels guiltythough of what he cannot be sureand unworthy of the object of his desire which now appears more alluring than ever Desire has now been redirected toward those particular objects protected by the others violence The link between desire and violence has been forged and in all likelihood it will never be broken Freud too wants to show that an indelible impression is made on the child when he first discovers his own desires overlapping those of his parents But because he eventually rejected the mimetic elements that had initially intrigued him he takes a different approach To appreciate this difference let us look again at that crucial passage in Group Psychology and the Analysis of the Ego uThe little boy notices that 116 Violence and the Sacred his father stands in his way with his mother His identification with his father then takes on a hostile colouring and becomes identical with the wish to replace his father in regard to his mother as well If we are to believe Freud the little boy has no difficulty recognizing his father as a rivala rival in the oldfashioned theatrical sense a nuisance a hindrance a terzo incommodo But even if this rivalry were provoked by something other than a desire to imitate the fathers desires a child would be unaware of this We have only to look at the numerous everyday displays of envy and jealousy to realize that even adults never attribute their mutual antagonisms to that simple phenomenon Freud is thus conferring on the child powers of discernment not equal but superior to those of most grownups Let me make myself clear I am not objecting to certain basic Freudian assumptions such as the attribution to the child of libidinal desires similar to those of adults but rather to the bold and surely untenable assertion which stands at the very center of his system that the child is fully aware of the existing rivalry of the hostile colouring Undoubtedly I am flying in the face of psychoanalytical orthodoxy denying the alleged evidence of clinical findings and before the doctors scientific mystique the layman can only bow But the texts we have been examining are based on no specific clinical findings Their speculative character is obvious and there is no more reason to treat them as holy writ as some have done than to try to sweep them under the carpet In either case we would be depriving ourselves of some valuable insights even if the object of these insights is not always what Freud takes it to be and depriving ourselves as well of the fascinating spectacle of Freuds intellect at work of the gradual and halting evolution of Freudian doctrine Undoubtedly clinical findings can be turned to almost any account but we can hardly expect them to serve as evidence for a consciousness no matter how transitory of patricidal or incestuous desire After all it is precisely because this consciousness refuses to yield to clinical observation that Freud is obliged to devise such unwieldy and dubious concepts as those of the unconscious or suppression And here we arrive at my principal complaint against Freud The mythical element of Freudianism has nothing to dodespite traditional assertions to the contrarywith the nonconscious nature of those basic impulses that determine the individuals psychological makeup If my complaint were a reiteration of that wellworn theme it would undoubtedly be classified among the reactionary criticism of Freudianism In the final analysis what I object to most is Freuds obstinate attachmentdespite all appearancesto a philosophy of consciousness Freud and the Oedipus Complex 777 The mythical aspect of Freudianism is founded on the conscious knowledge of patricidal and incestuous desire only a brief flash of consciousness to be sure a bright wedge of light between the darkness of the first identifications and the unconsciousbut consciousness all the same Freuds stubborn attachment to this consciousness compels him to abandon both logic and credibility He first assumes this consciousness and then gets rid of it in a kind of safedeposit box the unconscious In effect he is saying ego can suppress all consciousness of a patricidal and incestuous desire only if at one time ego truly experienced it Ergo sum The most remarkable aspect of this moment of unobstructed consciousness which Freud posits as the basis for mans psychic existence is its sheer uselessness Only by stripping it away do we uncover Freuds essential point the crucial and potentially catastrophic nature of the first contacts between child and parent or in other terms between the disciples desire and the models desire This moment of consciousness not only offers us nothing of importance but also serves to obscure the mimetic process which in both form and context possesses many advantages over the Freudian complex Further discussion along these lines might distract us from our main subject of inquiry so I shall only say in passing that I believe that a radically mimetic conception of desire offers a novel approach to psychiatric theory one as far removed from the Freudian unconscious as it is from any philosophy of consciousness camouflaged as an existential psychoanalysis Specifically this new approach succeeds in circumventing the fetish of adjustment without plunging into the inverse fetish of perversion that is typical of so much of modern theory The individual who adjusts has managed to relegate the two contradictory injunctions of the double bindto imitate and not to imitateto two different domains of application That is he divides reality in such a way as to neutralize the double bind This is precisely the procedure of primitive cultures At the origin of any individual or collective adjustment lies concealed a certain arbitrary violence The welladjusted person is thus one who conceals his violent impulses and condones the collectives concealment of them The maladjusted individual cannot tolerate this concealment Mental illness5 and rebellion like the sacrificial crisis they resemble commit the individual to falsehoods and to forms of violence that are certainly more damaging to him than the disguised violence channeled through sacrificial rites but that bring him closer to the heart of the enigma Many psychic 5 Because the very notion of mental illness has been up to a point correctly challenged in the writings of some contemporary physicians I put the term in quotation marks 118 Violence and the Sacred catastrophes misunderstood by the psychoanalyst result from an inchoate obstinate reaction against the violence and falsehood found in any human society A psychoanalytic system that no longer oscillated between the rigid conformism of social adjustment and the false scandal arising from the assumption of a mythical patricideincest drive in the child would not result in mere tepid idealism Rather such a system would bring us face to face with some traditional concepts that are troubling to say the least For example in Greek tragedy as in the Old Testament the good son cannot generally be distinguished from the bad son the good son is Jacob rather than Esau the prodigal son rather than the faithful son Oedipus   For the good son imitates the father with such passion that father and son become each others chief stumbling blocka situation the indifferent son more easily avoids It may appear at this point that all these concerns are foreign to the Freudian mode of thought and that the mimetic double bind has nothing to do with Freudian theory xct like your modeldo not act like your modelthe contradictory double imperative we see as fundamentalmay be thought to lead us far from the realms of psychoanalysis In reality it does not and this shows that Freuds work is too precious to be left to the psychoanalysts The mimetic approach preserves and enhances Freuds most acute insights In The Ego and the Id Freud explains that the relation between the ego and the superego is not exhausted by the precept You ought to be like this like your father7 It also comprises the prohibition You may not be like this like your fatherthat is you may not do all that he does some things are his prerogative    6 Who after reading this passage can deny Freuds proximity to my mimetic double bind Not only was he familiar with its operation but the context in which he placed it can help us realize its full potential Freuds definition of the superego presupposes something quite different from a mythical consciousness of rivalry he seems to have based it on the models identification with the obstacle an identification unperceived by the disciple The superego is in fact nothing more than a resumption of identification with the father now appearing chronologically after the Oedipus complex rather than before it As we have seen Freud did not actually suppress this previous identification perhaps because he balked at contradicting himself but he cunningly relegated it to secondary status by eliminating its primordial character 6Freud The Ego and the Id p 32 Freud and the Oedipus Complex 119 In any case the identification with the father now operates chiefly after the complex has taken hold it has become the superego If we reflect on the definition of the superego offered by Freud two facts become clear In the first place the definition accords with the concept of the double bind In the second place it fails to harmonize with Freuds picture of a sublimated Oedipus complex that is a patricideincest desire that has been transposed from the conscious to the unconscious To appreciate in full the predicament brought about by the superegos contradictory commands issued as they are in the atmosphere of ignorance and uncertainty implied by Freuds definition we must try to imagine the sons initial act of imitation It is performed with fervor and devotion and rewarded by sudden stupefying disgrace The positive injunction Be like your father had seemed to cover the entire range of paternal activities Nothing in this first command anticipates much less helps the son to understand the contradictory command that follows You may not be like your father And this command too seems to brook no exceptions All the sons efforts to differentiate between the commands and to formulate distinctions end in failure and his bewilderment gives rise to terror He wonders what he has done wrong and struggles to find separate areas of application for the two commands He finds it difficult to see where he is at faultcertainly he has broken no law yet known to himso he applies himself to discovering some new law that will allow him to define his conduct as illegal What conclusions must be drawn from this definition of the superego Why did Freud again toy with the mimetic effects that he had rejected at the Oedipal stager There seems only one possible answer he had no intention of renouncing the mimetic effects resulting from identification For he reverts to them when he takes up the concept of the superego Yet the definition of the superego follows almost immediately on the definition of the Oedipus complex previously quoted a definition purged of the mimetic elements that had characterized Freuds earlier definition in Group Psychology crnd the Analysis of the Ego It seems possible then to follow the evolution of Freuds thought from Group Psychology in 1921 to The Ego and the Id in 1923 In the earner work Freud believed it possible to reconcile the mimetic effect with his main thesis the Oedipus complex that is why observations on the mimetic phenomenon are sprinkled throughout this work But in the very course of composition it seems Freud began to sense the incompatibility of the two themes And this incompatibility quickly becomes all too clear The mimetic process detaches desire from any predetermined object whereas the Oedipus complex fixes desire on the maternal object The mimetic concept eliminates all conscious knowledge of patricideincest and even all desire for it as such the Freudian proposition by contrast is based entirely on a consciousness of this desire Freud evidently decided to permit himself the luxurv of his Oedipus complex When he had to choose between the mimetic concept and a fullblown patricideincest drive he opted firmly for the latter This is not to say that he renounced exploring the promising possibilities of mimesis the admirable thing about Freud is his refusal ever to renounce anything In suppressing the effects of mimesis he was simply trying to prevent mimesis from subverting his own cherished version of the Oedipus myth He wanted to get hold of the Oedipus complex once and for all so as to be free to return to the mimesis question Once he had the complex behind him he could take mimesis up where he had left it before the burgeoning of the idea of the complex In short Freud attempted initially to develop the Oedipus complex on the basis of a desire that is both objectoriented cathectic and yet originates in mimesiswhence comes the strange duality of the identification with the father and the lubidinous attraction for the mother in the first and even the second version of the complex The failure of this attempt at compromise compelled Freud to base his complex on a purely cathectic desire and to reserve the mimetic effect for another psychic structure the superego The duality of Freuds position stems from his effort to separate two poles of his thinking on desire cathectic and Oedipal at one extreme mimetic at the other But any attempt to sever the link between the two will end in failure as did the attempt at synthesis that preceded it It is hopeless to attempt to isolate the three elements of mimetic desire identification choice of object and rivalry That Freuds thought was never free of the influence of mimetic preoccupations can be proved by the irresistible conjunction of these three elements whenever any one of them appears the other two are sure to follow It was only with the greatest effort and at the expense of much of his credibility that Freud managed to rid his Oedipus complex of all traces of mimesis Conversely in the case of the superego where in principle nothing interferes with the sons paternal identification we witness once again an upsurge of rivalry for the mother object When the superego proclaims You may not be like this your father    some things are his prerogative Freud is clearly referring to the mother That is why he adds This double aspect of the ego ideal derives from the fact that the ego ideal had the task of repressing the Oedipus Freud and the Oedipus Complex 181 complex indeed it is to that revolutionary event that it owes its existence7 This superego simultaneously repressing and repressed which only exists thanks to that revolutionary event poses a formidable problem It knows too much even in a negative sense The truth is that the reactivating of the fatheridentification which gives the superego its meaning automatically reactivates the Oedipal triangle As I have remarked Freud cannot evoke one of the three elements of the mimetic configuration without the other twos putting in an appearance The reappearance of the Oedipal triangle was not in his program The Oedipus complex the capital that served to launch the entire psychoanalytic enterprise is supposed to be firmly locked away in the unconscious deposited deep in the vaults of the psyche This inopportune reappearance of the Oedipal triangle compelled Freud to admit that the son might experience certain difficulties in repressing his Oedipus complex In fact it is Freud himself who was having trouble disposing of the mimetic triangle Haunted by the mimetic rivalry he repeatedly sketched out triangular formations he believed to represent his complex whereas in fact they depict a constantly thwarted mimesisan interplay of model and obstacle that lingers at the edge of his thought but that he never succeeds in articulating fully I limited myself to examining two or three passages whose comparison seems particularly revealing other passages could have been chosen that would have suited my purposes equally well including some from the socalled clinical cases In my chosen passages a term fundamental to Freudian speculationambivalencereappears at frequent intervals It seems to me that this term testifies to the existence of the mimetic pattern in Freuds mind and to his inability to express correctly the relationship among the three elements of the structure the model the disciple and the object that is disputed by both because the models desire has made the object desirable to the disciple The object represents a desire shared by both and such sharing leads not to harmony as one might suppose but to bitter conflict The term ambivalence appears toward the close of the two definitions of the Oedipus complex previously quoted Here are the passages again His the boysi identification with the father takes on a hostile colouring and becomes identical with the wish to replace the father in regard to his mother as well Identification in fact is ambivalent from the very first i Ibid 182 Violence and the Sacred His identification with his father takes on a hostile colouring and changes into a wish to get rid of his father in order to take his place writh his mother Henceforward his relation to his father is ambivalent it seems as if the ambivalence inherent in the identification from the beginning had become manifest When we recall how the identification with the father is initially presentedThis behavior has nothing to do with a passive or feminine attitude towards his father   we seem to be dealing with a unified relationship free of ambiguity Why then does Freud a few lines later and seemingly as an afterthought attribute an underlying ambiguity to this identification Simply because he now senses and his intuition does not betray him that the positive feelings resulting from the first identificationimitation admiration venerationare fated to change into negative sentiments despair guilt resentment But Freud does not realize why such things must happen He does not realize because he cannot accept a concept of desire based on mimesis he cannot openly acknowledge the model in the identification to be a model of the desire itself and thus a powerful force of opposition Whenever he encounters the effects inherent in mimetic desire and finds himself struggling vainly to formulate its mechanism of rivalry Freud takes refuge in the idea of ambivalence To label these effects as ambivalent is to confine them to a solipsistic context a traditional philosophic subject instead of identifying them as a fundamental trait of all human relations the universal double bind of imitated desires If we try to grasp these effects of mimetic desire as individual pathology or psychology they become utterly incomprehensible in consequence we ascribe them to physical causes Freud himself conveys this impression and managed to persuade himself that in using the term ambivalence he had made a daring plunge into the dark regions where the psychic and the somatic meet In reality he was simply refusing to decipher a perfectly decipherable message And because the physical is by nature mute no rebuttal is possible Today everyone imagines himself tuned in to the physical able to decode the bodys messages after the example of Freud Yet in all Freuds work there is not a single example of ambivalence that does not have its origins in the obstaclemodel To attribute the conflict to the body is to give up on the logic of mimetic desire that can account most intelligibly and economically for all phenomena With Freud the physical aspect of the subject the corporeal regions of the psyche are endowed with a more or less organic propensity to run head on into the obstacle of the modeldesire Ambivalence becomes the main virtue of physicality insofar as it nourishes the psyche it becomes the virtus dormitiva of modern Freud and the Oedipus Complex 183 scholasticism in the face of desire Thanks to this idea and a number of others psychoanalysis has been able to grant a reprieveeven apparendy to grant new lifeto the myth of the individual by reasserting the claims of physicality Yet this is the very myth it should be trying to demolish Freuds use of the term ambivalence reveals a genuine if very limited recognition of mimetic desirewhich is more than can be said for many of his followers The interesting question is how Freud managed repeatedly to misconstrue such a simple mechanism In a sense its very simplicity served to camouflage its presence but there is something else at work here as well That something else is not difficult to identify we have encountered it at every turn in the course of our inquiry It is of course the hard core of the Oedipus complex that brief interval of consciousness when the patricideincest desire is felt to become a formal expression of the childs intentions It is clear that this Freudian view makes Freuds full discovery of mimetic desire impossible To persuade himself that the patricideincest desire actually exists Freud was obliged to disregard the model insofar as it is responsible for awakening the desire and designating the object Freud was forced to perpetuate a traditional retrogressive concept of the desire The drift of his thought in the direction of mimesis was perpetually checked by his strange loyalty to the patricideincest motif As an interpretative tool the concept of mimetic rivalry is far more serviceable than the Freudian complex By eliminating the conscious patricideincest desire it does away with the cumbersome necessity of the desires subsequent repression In fact it does away with the unconscious The concept explains the Oedipus myth and does so with an economy and precision lacking in the Freudian approach Why then we may well ask did Freud renounce the superior utility of mimetic desire to lavish his attention on the poor substitute of patricideincest Even if I am mistakeneven if I am blind to the virtues of the Oedipus myth as a universal model for the human psychestill my question remains valid It seems unlikely that Freud ever formally rejected the interpretation I am proposing here as a substitute for his complex in all likelihood it never came to his attention Had it done so Freud would surely have taken it under consideration if only to reject it y reading brings together a number of clues that seem to play little part in Freuds texts the obstacle of the patricideincest motif once removed we can bring together elements that remain disconnected in Freuds own work Freud was dazzled bv what he took to be his crucial discovery Loyalty to this disco very kept him from forging ahead on the path of mimesis Had he done so he would have 184 Violence and the Sacred come to realize the mythic nature of the patricideincest motif as it appears in the Oedipus myth and in psychoanalysis as well The whole of psychoanalysis seems to be summed up in the patricideincest theme It is this theme that has won psychoanalysis its glory and its notoriety that has provoked the incomprehension hostility and extraordinary devotion we have come to associate with the discipline It is this theme that is invariably invoked whenever any rebellious spirit dares to cast doubt on the efficacy of psychoanalytic doctrine Freuds intimations of mimetic desire never crystallized into a theory The founder of psychoanalysis brooded over the same themes throughout his lifetime and his unending struggle to reorganize the elements of desire never produced truly satisfactory results because he refused to abandon his object desire his cathectic viewpoint The various structures and examples of Freudianism theoretical concepts such as the castration complex the Oedipus complex the superego the unconscious repression ambivalenceall these are nothing more than defensive positions in his eternal battle to resolve the problem of desire Freudian analysis should not be regarded as a fully articulated system but as a series of experiments dealing almost invariably with the same subject The superego for instance is only a recasting of the Oedipus complex the more 1 examine the origins of the two concepts the more convinced I become that their differences are purely illusory Freud at his best is no more Freudian than Marx at his best is Marxist Nevertheless uncomprehending critics did on occasion provoke him to adopt a dogmatic line of argument that his followers blindly accepted and his opponents as blindly rejected therefore making it difficult for any of us to approach these texts with an open mind PostFreudian psychoanalysis has clearly perceived what must be done to systematize Freudianismor rather to sever it from its living roots To assure the autonomy of desire it is only necessary to erase the last traces of mimesis from the Oedipus complex Thus the identification with the father must be dropped Freud had already pointed the wray after all in The Ego and the Id Inversely to establish the supremacy of the superego on a firm basis one need only eliminate all those elements that tend to implicate the object and the subject of rivalry in its definition In short the postFreudian psychoanalyst reasserts a system an order of things based on common sense such as only Freud himself ever challenged In the case of the Oedipus complex the father becomes a disgraced rival thus there is no question of his being a venerated model Reciprocally in the case of the superego the father is the venerated model with no trace of the disgraced rival Freud and the Oedipus Complex 185 about him Ambivalence it would appear is good for patients but of no use to psychoanalysts We are presented therefore with a rivalry devoid of preliminary identification the Oedipus complex followed by an identification without subsequent rivalry the superego In one of his earliest articles Aggression in Psychoanalysis Jacques Lacan noted the bewildering character of this sequence The structural effect of the identification with the rival does not follow naturally except perhaps in mythic thinking8 But let us leave the myth aside we will presently see that it can take care of itself Moreover the effect noted by Lacan makes perfect sense in terms of the mimetic nature of desire which Lacan too failed to discover forced as he was by his linguistic fetishism to reinforce the more rigid and structural aspects of Freudian thinking The interest of Freudian analysis does not lie in its results in its pretentious accumulation of psychic agencies nor does it lie in the spectacle of Freudian apprentices clambering up and down the precarious scaffolding of Freudian doctrine with an agility as remarkable as it is futile It lies paradoxically enough in the ultimate inadequacies of the whole system Freud never succeeded in establishing the precise relationship of the model the disciple and their common object although he never entirely abandoned the effort Whenever he attempted to manipulate any two of the terms the third raised its head like a mocking jackinthebox which his disciples made haste to cram back in its box in the belief that they were doing something useful In fact it is hard to imagine a more effective method of castrating the Master  Q  4 SINCE FREUDS TIME it has often been disputed whether the Oedipus complex is a phenomenon exclusive to the Occidental world or whether it is also to be found in primitive societies Malinowskis The Father in Primitive Society has been cited in this context Malinowski begins by asserting that the Trobrianders are happier than Occidentals Yet these savages while free of the conflicts and tensions of civilization are heset by conflicts and tensions of their own In Trobriander society the maternal uncle performs some of the functions that in our society are allotted to the father It is from the uncle rather than the father that the children inherit their worldly goods it is the uncle who is responsible for their tribal education We should not be surprised therefore to observe that conflicts and tensions arise between children and uncle rather than between children and father 8 Jacques Lacan Ecrits Paris 1966 p 117 186 Violence and the Sacred and that in time of stress the father functions as a source of comfort and protection as an indulgent and welldisposed comrade9 Malinowski himself presents his observations in the context of a dialogue with Freud The impression thev leave is unclear The author begins by contradicting Freuds assertion that the Oedipus complex is universal His reflections on the status of the uncle follow seeming to cast a more favorable light on psychoanalytic theory Malinowski no longer appears to be questioning Freud but rather to be filling out his theories The uncles position in Trobriander society is analogous to the fathers position in Western society and in this sense the Oedipus complex could be said to partake of a certain universality7 Psychoanalysts have accorded Malinowskis work a warm reception They see it as a refutation of the anthropologists who have accused psychoanalysis of parochialism but they fail to notice that Malinowski whose Freudianism is rather superficial refers only to an explicit and fully conscious conflict between children and their Trobriander uncles There is nothing here on the psychoanalytic level that allows us to declare these conflicts to be rooted in an unconscious drama whose protagonist is the uncle himself It is scarcely likely that this omission would have gone unnoticed had the work been unfavorable to psychoanalysis Some of Malinowskis observations seem vital to the present discussion They address themselves directly to relationships that are of particular interest to us and that are the only real aspect of the Oedipus complex Without fully appreciating the significance of his own remarks Malinowski demonstrates that primitive societies or at any rate Trobriander society employ methods for combating mimetic rivalry and the double bind that are totally foreign to our own culture The essential factor here is not the fathers indulgence or the uncles severity not the displacement of authority from one masculine image to another rather it is the cleavage made between father and son the fact that the father and paternal culture in general does not serve as a model Father and son do not belong to the same lineage The father never commands the son Do as 1 do The child    learns that the place where his kada mothers brother resides is also his the childs own village that there he has his property and his other rights of citizenship that there are his future prospects there reside his natural allies and associates He may even be taunted in the village of his birth with being an outsider    Thus the life of a Trobriander runs under a twofold influencea duality which must not be imagined only as a mere surface play of custom It enters deeply into 9 Malinowski The Father in Primitive Society pp 1718 Freud and the Oedipus Complex 181 the existence of individual men it produces strange complications of usage it creates frequent tensions and difficulties   10 The sons live with a mantheir fatherwho does not incorporate their ideal in the Freudian sense of the ideal ego or the superego Such an ideal is indeed provided by the culture in the form of the closest adult relative in the maternal line but the children do not live with this model To begin with the maternal uncle intervenes rather late in the childrens1 existence and even then his presence is only intermittent for he usually lives in another village Moreover and most importantly there is a very strict taboo denying him any contact with his sister the mother of the children So in Freudian terms as well as in those of the double bind the displacement toward the uncle is illusory The avuncular Oedipus complex then turns out to be little more than a whimsy In fact the tensions that exist between uncle and nephew are the morS explicit because the child is not torn by contradictory feelings for him the obstacle cannot become the model nor the model the obstacle The mimesis is channeled in such a way that desire will not take its own obstacle as an object The study of other primitive systems would probably reveal that in those instances where the cultural model is incarnated in a specific individual the models sphere of activity never impinges on that of the disciple so as to produce a convergence of their two desires In fact the two spheres of activity only touch at those points and at those predetermined moments that are necessary to ensure the disciples initiation into the culture Malinowskis observations give us reason to believe that primitive societies cope with the double bind more effectively than does Western society Indeed howr can we define Western society in terms relevant to the Trobrianders In our society ever since the time of the ancient patriarchs a plurality of functions which among the Trobrianders are divided between father and uncle have been assigned to one man alone Our patriarchal system is less differentiated than the Trobriander system and even though it can and must appear to us from the point of view of the modern family as the extreme of arbitrary structuralization from the perspective of primitive societies it would be regarded as the opposite Surely we should abandon the use of the Oedipus complex a seemingly inexhaustible source of confusion We could then bring into conjunction with conflictual mimesis those entirely genuine phenomena that psychoanalysis has explained by its Oedipus complex These phenomena would gain in coherence moreover it would become pos10 Ibid pp 1819 188 Violence and the Sacred sible to incorporate them into a diachronic plan to situate historically not only the phenomena themselves but also the theories that have been proposed to explain thembeginning of course with psychoanalysis itself A theoretical concept such as the Oedipus complex can only be applied to a society in which reciprocal mimesis has already been established and the modelobstacle mechanism set in motion but its violent effects not yet generally felt In addition this mechanism must usually be triggered by the father If the double bind originates with the father the mimetic attraction will preserve its paternal coloring as long as the victim lives With the individual as with groups mimetic attraction always becomes more and more acute it always tends to reproduce its initial forms in other terms it always seeks new modelsand new obstaclesthat resemble the original one If this original model is the father the subject will choose models that resemble him In Western society the father had already become the model by the patriarchal era In order for the double bind to operate he had also to become the obstacle And the father can onlv become an obstacle wrhen the diminution of his paternal authority has brought him into a direct confrontation with his son obliging him to occupy the same sphere The Oedipus complex appears most plausible in a society in which the fathers authority has been greatly weakened but not completely destroyed that is in Western society during the course of recent centuries Here the father has functioned as the original model and the original obstacle in a world where the dissolution of differences encourages the proliferation of the double bind This state of affairs requires an explanation If the history of modern society is marked by the dissolution of differences that clearly has something to do with the sacrificial crisis to which we have repeatedly referred Indeed the phrase modern world seems almost like a synonym for sacrificial crisis It should be noted however that the modern world manages to retain its balance precarious though it may be and the methods it employs to do so though extreme are not so extreme as to destroy the fabric of the society As my previous chapters indicated primitive societies are unable to withstand such pressures violence would quickly get out of hand and trigger the mechanism of generative unanimity thus restoring a social system based on multiple and sharply pronounced differences In the modern Western world nothing of this kind takes place The wearing away of differences proceeds at a slow7 but steady pace and the results are absorbed more or less gracefully by a community that is slowly but steadily coming to encompass the entire globe It is not law in any conceivable form that is responsible for the Freud and the Oedipus Complex 189 tensions and alienation besetting modern man rather it is the increasing lack of law The perpetual denunciation of the law arises from a typically modern sense of resentmenta feedback of desire that purports to be directed against the law but one that is actually aimed at the modelobstacle whose dominant position the subject stubbornly refuses to acknowledge The more frenzied the mimetic process becomes caught up in the confusion of constantly changing forms the more unwilling men are to recognize that they have made an obstacle of the model and a model of the obstacle Here we encounter a true unconscious and one that can obviously assume many forms Freud is of little use as a guide over this terrain So for that matter is Nietzsche who reserves his resentment for the weak while trying vainly to establish a distinction between this resentment and a truly spontaneous desire a will to power that he can claim as wholly his own but that is in reality nothing more than the ultimate expression of cumulative resentment No our best guide is perhaps Kafka one of the few to perceive that the absence of law is in fact identical with law run wild and that this identity constitutes the chief burden of mankind Once more our best guide turns out to be one of those writers of fiction whose insights have been studiously ignored by psychological researchers When the father is no longer an overbearing patriarch the son looks everywhere for the lawand finds no lawgiver If the patriarchal system when compared to primitive systems seems to represent a lesser degree of structuralization then Western civilization since the decline of the patriarchal system can be said to have been governed by a principle of decreasing structuralization or destructralization during the whole of its historical coursea tendency that can almost be seen as an ultimate aim A dynamic force seems to be drawing first Western society then the rest of the world toward a state of relative indifferentiation never before known on earth a strange kind of nonculture or anticulture we call modern The advent of psychoanalysis has been historically determined by the advent of the modern Most of the phenomena associated with the Oedipus complex reveal a true unity and intelligibility when seen in the light of the mimetic processand this remains true even if the main body of belief is purely mythical The Oedipus complex might seem to be a satisfactory theory during the early stages of mimetic propagation in a historical situation characterized by the limited survival at least for a while of family structures derived from the patriarchal system We can witness here the same process of disintegration that takes place in primitive societies during the sacrificial crisis but in this case the process is gradual kept more or less in rein with no catastrophic outbursts of violence and no resolution of any kind taking 190 Violence and the Sacred place The astonishing flexibility of the modern along with its extraordinary functionalism is here on view Equally visible are the everincreasing tensions that beset modern times The Oedipus complex is a Western and modern phenomenon as are the relative neutralization and sterilization of a mimetic desire that though in the process of freeing itself is still oriented toward the father and therefore inclined toward certain forms of order and stability Psychoanalysis at this particular moment in history seems at once to announce and to prepare the way for something it cannot itself describe an advanced stage of indifferentiation or decoding which involves the complete effacement of the paternal function Like all forms of mythical thought psychoanalysis is a closed system that can never be refuted If there is no conflict between father and son it is because the unconscious aspect of the complex has come into play and if there is a conflict that too is a result of the complex In short the complex is bound to appear and if it does not that circumstance only confirms its existence Not only can the teachings of psychoanalysis always be confirmed but they seem increasingly to the point as mimesis spreads and grows more acute as destructuralization becomes more widespread and the double bind proliferates The Oedipus complex waxes as the father wanes It has become routine to ascribe all sorts of psychic disorders to an Oedipus whose Laius remains obstinately out of sight The need to trace the complex to some fleshandblood father or uncle or any one individual at all is now said to be illusory as indeed it is Psychoanalysis vanquishes all challengers It is everywhereand nowhere It finally dissolves into the banality of multisided familial and nonfamilial rivalries in a more and more competitive world 4 IF THE OEDIPUS COMPLEX constitutes an erroneous reading of the double bind then we can say that those desires that the world at large and the father in particular regard as emanating from the sons own patricideincest drive actually derive from the father himself in his role as model The Freudian myth is still so influential today even among skeptics that the foregoing statement may well seem like sheer perversity I feel constrained therefore to seek support from a reputable author whose authority in these matters is generally acknowledged Sophocles We could of course turn once more to Oedipus the King but that play has been used so often and for so many purposes that its value as an example has worn thin Let us rather consider a less familiar play The Women of Trachis In the last episode Heracles the protagonist has put on his poisoned Freud and the Oedipus Complex 191 tunic and lies writhing in agony on the ground His son Hyllos stands by respectfully awaiting his fathers last orders Heracles orders his son to light a great fire and place him still living on the pyre thus Heracles will be free of his pain Hyllos cries out in protest his father is making a patricide of him Heracles insists in such a manner as to make himself responsible for the act responsible for perpetrating a ruthless double bind Heracles Do as I say for this must be done Or else cease to call yourself my son Hyllos Oh father what are you asking of me To be your murderer to assume the guilt of your death What follows is even more extraordinary Heracles has a second favor less important than the first to ask of his sonand at this point the play takes on a distinctly comic air at any rate for modern ears attuned to Freudian motifs Because his death leaves his young wife lole acquired in the course of the last labor without a protector Heracles makes a proposal to his son Heracles When I am dead if you wish to show your piety and stand by the vows made to your father make her lole your wife Do not deny me this She has slept at my side and it is my wish that no one but you possess her Go take her to your bed What good is it if you carry out my greater commands and neglect the lesser ones like this Hyllos Ah it is wrong to lose ones temper at a sick man yet how hard it is to put up with him when he has such ideas After this exchange not unworthy of a postFreudian Moliere the dialogue continues to gain in interest Hyllos offers as his reason for refusing lole the role she has playedthough only as passive spectator in the family tragedy that is now drawing to a close In fact it is the true relationship between the fathers desire and the sons desire that is being challenged an identification that appears as impious rebellion to the world at large although it is in fact an absolute submission to the paternal command to the insidious and imperious suggestion by the paternal model that the son desire what the father desires Hyllos Father have pity on me 1 am the most wretched of men Heracles Because you refuse to obey your father Hyllos But when you preach impiety to your son Heracles There can be no impiety in your pleasing me Hyllos Then these are your final orders Heracles They are and the gods are my witnesses 192 Violence and the Sacred Hyllos Then I will obey For the gods know it is your will and surely a son does no wrong in obeying his father Heracles Then all is well    As we can see the ancient drama is more knowledgeable in the ways of fathers and sons than is modern psychoanalytic theory It provides modern theorists with a lesson in humility For Sophocles speaking over the span of twentyfive centuries can help us to cast off that most burdensome of all mythologies the myth of the Oedipus complex11 11 This is perhaps the place to call attention to the signal perceptiveness of other purely literary works that touch upon the same subject On the question of paternal incitement to patricide Calderons remarkable La Vida es meno merits special attention See also Cesareo Banderas highly original study Mimesis conflictiva Madrid Gredos 1975 This study reveals Calderon as an author who goes one step beyond Freud in dealing with the question of desire and the obstacle that masquerades as the law 8fc Chapter Eight Totem and Taboo and the Incest Prohibition CftSdri CONTEMPORARY CRITICISM is almost unanimous in      finding unacceptable the theories set forth in Totem and Taboo Freud assumes at the outset the very propositions his book is supposed to explore Darwins primal horde is a caricature of the family and the sexual monopoly of the dominant male coincides with future prohibitions regarding incest As LeviStrauss remarks in The Elementary Structures of Kinship we have here ua vicious circle deriving the social state from events which presuppose it1 This objection has validity if one considers the work only in its broad outlines Still there are aspects of Totem and Taboo that elude categorization And although one might assume that the theory of collective murder for example presented in the work has been amply clarified by the critics such is not the case To be sure the subject of collective murder invariably crops up in connection with the book indeed it seems to constitute the main attraction of this work this bizarre edifice through which we are guided by ghb commentators who seem one and all to have the same story to tell Totem and Taboo they assure us is an example of the aberrations to which genius is prone These commentators see the work either as an anomaly or as an unwitting farcesomething like the novels of Victor Hugos old age A reexamination of the work in question confirms our uneasiness The murder motif is conspicuous but it serves no apparent purpose If the subject of the book is the genesis of sexual prohibitions then this motif hinders Freuds argument rather than helps it Without the murder motif we could pass easily from the sexual privations inflicted on the young bv a primordial father to the strictly cultural prohibitions But the murder breaks the circuit and while Freud tries dutifully to 1 Claude LeviStrauss The Elementary Structures of Kinship trans James Harle Bell John Richard von Sturmer and Rodney Needham Boston 1969 p 491 193 194 Violence and the Sacred restore the connection he does so without conviction Ultimately his ideas on the subject of sexual prohibitions are both more confused and less simplistic than has been generally acknowledged Far from serving to put things in order the murder motif seems to throw everything into disarray The theory that attributes the prohibitions to the fathers sexual monopoly is not Freuds invention as Freud himself makes plain Atkinson 1903 seems to have been the first to realize that the practical consequence of the conditions obtaining in Darwins primal horde might be exogamy for the young males Each of them might after being driven out establish a similar horde in which the same prohibition upon sexual intercourse would rule owing to its leaders jealousy In course of time this would produce what grew into a conscious law No sexual relations between those who share a common home After the establishment of totemism this regulation would assume another form and would run No sexual relations within the totem2 The concept of collective murder however undoubtedly originates with Freud Its apparent superfluousness and incongruity has prompted critics to wonder why Freud included it at all and French psychoanalysts have responded to the question in their customary fashion by attributing the concept to the authors unconscious In Totem and Taboo they inform us Freud treats his readers to a particularly spectacular revelation of his own repressed desires And although this is the sort of response we have learned to expect from Freuds followers it is slightly disconcerting to find it applied to the master himself Of all Freuds works Totem and Taboo is the only one thus singled out for therapeutic treatment the only one for which such a treatment is not only permitted but apparently encouraged Freudians are generally prompt to pay obeisance to the least utterance of their oracle and to denounce in violent terms the most tentative questioning of his conclusions3 A summary condemnation of Totem and Taboo must make a strong impression on the lay observer who can only conclude that this particular work must have been very badly botched indeed Modern ethnologists although generally kinder to amateurs than are their colleagues in the field of psychoanalysis have shown themselves equally severe toward Totem and Taboo The work was published in 1913 when ethnology was still a fledgling science The theories drawn on by FreudFrazers and in particular Robertson Smithshave long 2Freud Standard Edition vol 13 Totem and Taboo p 126 3 The author has in mind primarily the modern French school of Freudian psychoanalysisTrans Totem and Taboo and the Incest Prohibition 195 been superseded The concept of totemism is virtually obsolete and above all Freuds main thesis is patently false In short there are so many excellentreasons for condemning Totem and Taboo that the work has never received serious critical examination Yet if it is true that Freud lost his head in the writing of this essay surely it is worthwhile to determine how why and to what extent he went astray The greater ones esteem for Freuds genius the more valid such an inquiry appears The accusations leveled at Totem and Taboo must cast doubt on Freuds other theories as wellat any rate until the Freudians succeed in localizing the difficulty and correcting it But this is precisely what certain neoFreudians failindeed refuseto undertake The antireferential prejudice is so strong that it has become second nature True scientific inquiry is always open to disquieting speculations to theories that flatly contradict the beliefs of the moment or challenge their most cherished conventions But perhaps it is misleading to speak of disquieting theories we should rather refer to theories of varying degrees of credibility Before accusing Freud of succumbing to his illusionsas if he were a mere fictionmakera Shakespeare or a Sophocles or a Euripideslet us at least give him a hearing It is strange that the very people who claim to represent the living spirit of psychoanalysis dismiss Freud the most flippantly Everyone seems intent on covering Totem and Taboo with obloquy and condemning it to oblivion My own attitude toward the book is obviously quite different Freuds concept of collective murder and the arguments he uses to present it are too close to the themes of my own work for me to pass over the book in silence It is important to bear in mind that an ethnological theory can be justly criticized even conclusively refuted without invalidating the evidence collected in its defence Although totemism has been shown to be only one facet of a far broader form of activitythat of classificationit does not necessarily follow that the religious phenomena that were previously explained by totemism are now to be considered null and void These phenomena must simply be considered in a broader context our concern should now be directed to the relationship between religion and the overall question of classification That distinctions should exist or that these distinctions should remain stable cannot be taken for granted from the standpoint of primitive societies Totemism may indeed be illusory but this illusion served to focus attention on the enigma of religious belief Freud was fully aware of the risks involved in selecting totemism as the rallying point for his arguments Far from placing a blind trust in the concept he scrutinized his results with a critical eye and concluded 196 Violence and the Sacred that everything connected with totemism seems to be puzzling4 He found none of the proposed solutions to his liking including the one he qualified as nominalism which when carried to its logical conclusions has led to the contemporary refutation of the entire concept The nominalist theories I have so far discussed    might perhaps explain the fact that primitive peoples adopt animal names for their clans but they could never explain the importance that has become attached to this nomenclaturenamely the totemic system5 What is important here is not the reference to the totem or to any other system but the religious presence which must not be casually and fraudulently dismissed as something that goes without saying It is no part of the role of science to deprive the spirit of the justifiable sense of wonderment that is occasioned by certain human acts Freud rejected all those too rational points of view that fail to take into account the affective side of things Freuds attention was caught by the same kinds of actsin some instances actually by the identical actsthat I have presented in the preceding chapters He observed that in primitive religion extreme opposites coincide good and evil sadness and joy accepted and forbidden practices The festival for example is a permitted or rather an obligatory excess a solemn breach of a prohibition6 The coincidence of the permitted and the prohibited brings to mind the sacrificial process when the deed is done the slaughtered animal is lamented and bewailed     This is hardly surprising because sacrifice and festival are one and the same rite There is no gathering of a clan without an animal sacrifice norand this now becomes significant any slaughter of an animal except on these ceremonial occasions7 The same mingling of the permitted and the prohibited is found in the treatment of certain animals even when the sacrificial element is not formally present A totem animal that is found dead is mourned and buried like a dead kinsman If it is necessary to kill a totem animal this is done according to a prescribed ritual of apologies and ceremonies of expiation8 Freud discerns this strange duality of sacrificial custom in all aspects of primitive religion The rite is invariably presented in the form of a murder a transgression both culpable and obligatory whose virtue lies ultimately in its very impiety Robertson Smith clearly perceived the unifying factors in those 4 Freud Totem md Taboo p 108 5 Ibid p 111 8 Ibid p 140 7 Ibid p 135 8 Ibid p 104 Totem and Taboo and the Incest Prohibition 191 practices that broadly speaking correspond to our sacrificial rites and that he chose to group under the heading totemism The term had a great vogue among ethnologists who shared a particular body of knowledge as well as certain intellectual attitudes that no longer seem valid But if we do not always agree with their concepts we approve of their quest to fathom the hidden meaning of primitive religions and to establish their essential unity It is this quest for unity that led Robertson Smith and later Freud to propose totemism as the origin of all religious manifestations These socalled totemic beliefs serve to direct our attention to some extraordinary manifestations of religious belief customs at once paradoxical and enigmatic that seem to demand a full interpretation and that are therefore the most likely to lead us toward the truth It was in the aspects of totemism that dealt specifically with religion that Freud found far more conspicuously than elsewhere that coincidence of opposites that serves to define the overall process of religion Religious totemism is connected with the operation in which violence caught up in its own paroxysm produces an inversion by means of an actual act of collective murder Freud astutely surmised the necessity for this act but because the mechanism of the surrogate victim eluded him he failed to grasp its modus operandi This mechanism provides the only feasible explanation of how a sacrificial murder originally regarded as a crime can literally be transformed into an act of piety There seems to be a very close connection if not an essential similarity between this transformation and the clans individual attitudes toward their totems In many instances the pursuit of the totem its slaughter and devouring are expressly restricted to those solemn festivals that seem to involve a somewhat equivocal inversion of customfor during those festivals the entire clan is obliged to commit all the acts forbidden throughout the rest of the year The urge to duplicate the operation of the surrogate victim is even more apparent in the case of totemic belief than in the classic sacrifice Clearly the truth we are seeking is close at hand and although Freud failed to grasp it he was surelv on the right track when he concentrated his attention on totemism His intuition did not play him false in suggesting a connection between the enigmas of religion and an actual act of murder But for want of a mechanism that would make this connection Freud was unable to translate his discovery into any kind of plausible formulation He never advanced beyond the idea of a single act of murder in principle at least committed in prehistoric timesan idea that if taken literally lends a note of fantasy to his theory Before we assert that Freud dreamed of murdering his own father or 198 Violence and the Sacred wrote his book under dictation from his unconscious it might be worth while to review the arguments so forcefully advanced in Totem and Taboo Freud insists as I have also done on the need for unanimous participation in the rites If these rites were not performed by the entire group acting in unison they would be nothing more than criminal acts of destructive intent Freud fails to perceive the functional dimension of unanimity but he is nonetheless aware that the sanctity of the proceedings depends on their indivisibility In many cultures moreover the mananimal or totemic monster assumes the guise of judge mentor and ancestor without relinquishing his role as victim slaughtered by his fellows and peers the first being cut down by a community which while mythic is nonetheless a double of real society We have here a series of clues well worth pursuing and it is a sad commentary on our present intellectual scene that we cannot draw the logical conclusion from themnamely a theory of collective murder without provoking an automatic rejection from critics who like to think of themselves as the practitioners of impartial scientific inquiry A careful comparison of sacrificial rites and totemic beliefs will bring out certain dominant strains that have a direct bearing on the subject of collective murder All the signs seem to suggest that the gods along with the community itself owe their origin to internal and unanimous violence and to a victim who is a member of the community A life Freud quotes Robertson Smith which no single tribesman is allowed to invade and which can be sacrificed only by the consent and common action of the kin stands on the same footing with the life of the fellowtribesmen The rule that every participant at the sacrificial meal must eat a share of the flesh of the victim has the same meaning as the provision that the execution of a guilty tribesman must be carried out by the tribe as a whole In other words the sacrificial animal was treated as a member of the tribe the sacrificing community the god and the sacrificial animal were of the same blood and members of the same clan Freuds italics9 As we can see the problematic aspects of the totemic theory7 do not affect Freuds basic conclusions Indeed totemism plays no part here The dynamism of Totem and Taboo is directed toward a general theory of sacrifice Robertson Smith had already pointed the way but Freud managed to push the inquiry furtherlargely because he was indifferent to the theoretical debates then raging among anthropologists The enormous mass of collaborative information obviously de Ibid p 133 Totem and Taboo and the Incest Prohibition 199 manded a single allembracing explanation a general theory that was first and foremost related to the subject of sacrifice Robertson Smith explains that sacrifice at the altar was the essential feature in the ritual of ancient religions It plays the same part in all religions so that its origin must be traced back to very general causes operating everywhere in the same manner10 Freuds archetypal sacrificial rite was practiced by a tribe of the Sinai desert It is described by St Nilus in the fourth century and cited by Robertson Smith who himself found it highly significant The victim of the sacrifice a camel Freud quoting Robertson Smith is bound upon a rude altar of stones piled together and when the leader of the band has thrice led the worshippers round the altar in a solemn procession accompanied with chants he inflicts the first wound    and in all haste drinks the blood that gushes forth Forthwith the whole company fall on the victim with their swords hacking off pieces of the quivering flesh and devouring them raw with such wild haste that in the short interval between the rise of the day star to which the sacrifice was offered    and the disappearance of its rays before the rising sun the entire camel body bones skin blood and entrails is wholly devoured11 In my opinion the socalled totemic survivals that Robertson Smith thought he had detected in the sacrifice can be attributed here as elsewhere to an incomplete grasp of the part played by the surrogate victim And Freuds interest in these totemic survivals sprang from their relationship to his own concept of collective murder Given the Sinai sacrifice and the context in which it appears we can hardly blame Freud from drawing the conclusions that he did in favor of his murder theory Indeed is it really so obvious that Freud has abandoned the principles of sound scientific practice in this work and that his whole theory is based on a personal illusion that is psychological in origin Faithful to his sources Freud limits his discussion almost exclusively to the camel sacrifice One cannot help wondering what conclusions he would have drawn had he taken into account similar practices over a broad spectrum of independent cultures and submitted them to a systematic comparison In the Sinai sacrifice the camel is bound like a criminal and the crowd is armed in the Dionysiac diasparagmos the victim is not bound and the attackers have no weapons But twro constants remain the crowd and the mad rush at the victim In some instances the victim is encouraged to flee in others it is the participants who take flight In every instance a mob murder is being reenacted although the scenes 10 Ibid 11 Ibid p 138 200 Violence and the Sacred will vary in details These divergences should not be attributed to any lapse of the ritual memory for the forms of collective murder differ somewhat from one religion to another These differences though slight are revealing for they evoke the realism of the model and therefore discourage any attempt at purely formalist interpretation These differences may have led to Freuds intuitive grasp of the situation even though they are only implicit in Totem and Taboo Indeed it would have been impossible for Freud to consider them explicitly for his theory of a single unique act of murder could neither accommodate nor explain them An investigation into the nature of ritual resembles the sort of criminal investigationno less valid for figuring so frequently in detective fictionin which the solution of the mystery depends on a reenactment of the crime No matter how clever the criminal no matter how careful he may be to eliminate all traces of his presence he is unable to extend his activities or repeat his past successes without laying down a trail for his pursuers A seemingly insignificant detail passed over in haste during the investigation of the first crime suddenly assumes importance when it reappears in a slightly different guise In the same way the successive proofs of an engraving allow us to discern patterns or images that might well pass unnoticed when looking at one print in isolation These differences constitute the ethnological equivalent of Abschattungei those partiaj and always shifting perceptions that end by establishing in terms of Husserlian phenomenology the stable and indubitable element of a given object Once the law of their variations has been apprehended the true object is correctly perceived Doubt is then no longer possible the image remains indelible and any additional information can only serve to consolidate and reinforce the now correctly identified object Freud was not dreaming when he wrote Totem and Tabooy and he assumed that the participants in sacrificial rites were not dreaming either He could well have turned the rites into a dream this would have been a possible line of defense for a formalist hard pressed by the massed body of ethnological evidence But Freud did not take that path Efforts have been made to prove him a formalist but in this case at least he clearly perceived that any attempt to structure the dream would be as futile as trying to structure the wind To declare sacrifice a psychoanalytical fantasy would mean to lay aside an impressive body of rigorously determined facts and observations that cry out for attention To dissolve these phenomena in dreams would be to deny the rites any status as a social institution it would be to deny in effect social unity itself Totem and Taboo and the Incest Prohibition 201 The sacrificial act is too rich in concrete details to be only a simulation of something that never actually occurred This assertion can be made without contradicting my previous statement that the act is a simulated performance designed to offer a substitute satisfaction Sacrifice takes the place of an act that nobody under normal cultural conditions would dare or even desire to commit it is this aspect that Freud wholly intent on the origins of sacrifice paradoxically failed to perceive I qualify his failure as paradoxical because Totem and Taboo lacks the one form of truth that appears though sometimes in distorted form in the rest of his work Freud understands that sacrifice must be traced back to an event of a quite different type from ritual itself yet his intuition of origins because he did not follow it to the end caused him to lose all sense of the function of the rite If sacrifice is accorded a particular role in the rite this is because it was at one time something else and because it retains that something else as a model In order to reconcile function with origin and illuminate one by means of the other Freud needed a tool that he failed to unearth the surrogate victim Nevertheless Freud made an important discovery He was the first to maintain that all ritual practices all mythical implications have their origins in an actual murder Freud was unable to exploit the boundless implications of this proposition in fact he seemed unaware of the truly vertiginous scope of this idea After his death his discovery was summarily dismissed On the basis of secondary considerations Totem and Taboo was written off as misleading or trivial This attitude can be partially explained by the primary concern of Freuds followers to consolidate the terrain conquered in the previous generation by Freud and others they found their efforts severely challenged by the implications of Totem and Tabooy and so the work was thrust aside Freuds momentous discovery was ignored as if it had never taken place Far from handling his ethnological material like a clumsy amateur Freud accomplished such a feat of systematization that he himself was thrown off balance He was unable to formulate the hypothesis that would do justice to his discovery and no one after him had the vision to perceive that such a thing was even possible As an advance scout Freud was all too daring and he found himself cut off from his own line Freud has been called a victim of naive historicism the opposite is true His general orientation and his methods of research freed him from the fragmentary theories of origin and the antistructural associations that his contemporaries were prone to at the same time he stayed clear of the opposite excesses which plague our own era His mind was not closed to questions of origin nor did his failures awaken in him 202 Violence and the Sacred any formalistic or antigenetic prejudices Freud swiftly perceived that a firm grasp of synchronic totalities should result in new concepts regarding the problem of origins concepts that had previously been wholly unimaginable    K  ONE PASSAGE in Totem and Taboo is of particular relevance to our inquiry Freud is discussing tragedy the tragic mode as it is practiced all over the world A company of individuals named and dressed alike surrounded a single figure all hanging upon his words and deeds they were the Chorus and the impersonator of the Hero He was originally the only actor Later a second and third actor were added to play as counterpart to the Hero and as characters split off from him but the character of the Hero himself and his relation to the Chorus remained unaltered The Hero of tragedy must suffer to this day that remains the essence of a tragedy He has to bear the burden of what was known as tragic guilt the basis of that guilt is not always easy to find for in the light of our everyday life it is often no guilt at all As a rule it lay in rebellion against some divine or human authority and the Chorus accompanied the Hero with feelings of sympathy sought to hold him back to warn him and to sober him and mourned over him when he had met with what was felt as the merited punishment for his rash undertaking But why had the Hero of tragedy to suffer And what was the meaning of this tragic guilt 1 will cut the discussion short and give a quick reply He had to suffer because he was the primal father the Hero of the great primaeval tragedy which was being reenacted with a tendentious twist and the tragic guilt was the guilt which he had to take on himself in order to relieve the Chorus from theirs The scene upon the stage was derived from the historical scene through a process of systematic distortionone might even say as the product of a refined hypocrisy In the remote reality it had actually been the members of the Chorus who caused the Heros suffering now however they exhausted themselves with sympathy and regret and it was the Hero himself who was responsible for his own sufferings The crime which was thrown on to his shoulders presumptuousness and rebelliousness against a great authority was precisely the crime for which the members of the Chorus the company of brothers were responsible Thus the tragic Hero became though it might be against his will the redeemer of the Chorus12 In many respects this passage brings us closer to the concept of the surrogate victim and the mythical structuration effected through it than anything we have yet encountered in Freud Whole sentences address themselves directly to our discussion The hero represents the i2Ibid p 15556 Totem and Taboo and the Incest Prohibition 203 victim of a momentous and unexpected tragedy The tragic flaw attributed to him is shared by the whole community but he alone must bear its burden in order for the citv to be saved The hero thus assumes the role of surrogate victim and in the very next paragraph Freud alludes to the divine goat Dionysus Tragedy is thus defined as a tendentious reenactment a mythic inversion of an event that actually took place The scene upon the stage was derived from the historical scene through a process of systematic distortionone might even say as the product of a refined hypocrisy Let me again call attention to what is undoubtedly an essential point the collective violence directed against the solitary hero takes place amidst that dissolution of distinctions I discussed earlier on The sons of the primitive clan henceforth deprived of fathers have all become enemy brothers Their resemblance is such that they do not possess identities of their own We are left with a group of people all bearing the same name identically dressed I must take care however not to exaggerate the similarities between Freuds theories and mv own The outlooks are ultimately different and the difference bears on the genesis of difference According to Freud the crowd of doubles stands in opposition to the absolute specificity of the hero The hero monopolizes innocence the mob monopolizes guilt The flaw attributed to the hero is not his but belongs exclusively to the crowd The hero then is a victim pure and simple charged with a crime he did not commit This concept of a simple oneway projection of guilt seems to me inadequate Sophocles is wiser he makes it clear and Dostoevsky was to do the same in The Brothers Karamazov that the surrogate victim even when falsely accused may be as guilty as the others For the traditional concept of the flaw perpetuated as sin by theologically minded critics should be substituted that of violenceviolence in the past the future and above all in the present violence equally shared by all After all Oedipus himself joined in the manhunt The Freudian interpretation is thoroughly modern in its inversion of the mythical content Thanks to the innocent victim with whose fate one can easily identify it becomes possible to inculpate all the false innocents This is precisely what Voltaire did in his Oedipe and what the contemporary antitheater is striving to do in an atmosphere of everincreasing confusion and hysteria Our neighbors values are forever being inverted to be used as a weapon against him In the final analysis however each and every one of us is implicated in the effort to perpetuate the structures of the myth whose very imbalance is designed to stimulate our own aggression 204 Violence and the Sacred Differences seem to have vanished only to reappear in inverted form thereby perpetuating themselves It is these differences that Heidegger refers to in relation to all of philosophy from Plato to Nietzsche there the identical inversion occurs Philosophical concepts serve to shield from sight the tragic conflict of human antagonisms What Freud fails to perceive is that his own thought is influenced by these same patterns and that even his interpretation of tragedy forms part of the conflict and never succeeds in rising above it Moreover the fixed nature of his reading corresponds precisely to the concept of the single murder the murder of a true father a true hero which took place at a single moment in time The father figure is viewed as an oppressive monster during his life but is transformed at death into a persecuted hero This operation is effected by the mechanism of the sacreda mechanism Freud does not uncover since he remains its victim In order to escape once and for all from the domination of a certain kind of morality even metamorphosed into antimorality and a certain kind of metaphysic even disguised as antimetaphysics we must renounce the gambit of good and badeven in its inverted form We must acknowledge that misapprehensions abound that violence is to be found everywhere and that our partial understanding of violence by no means assures us victory over it The first step must be the heros reintegration into the chorus his assumption of the chorus characteristic lack of characteristics It might be argued that Freud adheres more closely to the structure of tragedy in his interpretation than I do and in one sense this is correct In the tragic form inherited from myth and ritual the solitary figure of the hero does indeed occupy the dominant central position assigned him by Freud But that is only the beginning of the analysis the matter must be pressed to its conclusion and the tragic form itself along with the myth must be scrupulously dismantled Thus we will learn that Sophocles while not following through to the end succeeded nonetheless in advancing farther than Freud along the path of demystification Sophocles treats the essential elusiveness of the heroic difference with relentless irony making it plain that the most conspicuous examples of individuality are put in doubt at the very moment when they seem strongest and most validwhen in short they are brought into violent opposition with another individual who turns out to be almost identical My approach incorporates all Freuds observations it also takes into account those elements that escaped his but not Sophocles attention Finally it deals with those elements that escaped even Sophocles noticewith the configurations that give rise to myth and the differTotem and Taboo and the Incest Prohibition 205 ent perspectives including the psychoanalytic and the tragic from which the subject can be viewed In short my innovation is to introduce the mechanism of the surrogate victim Freuds comments on Greek tragedy are undoubtedly the most profound of all modern pronouncements on the subject And yet they remain inconclusive Strictly speaking it is not incorrect to qualify tragedy as tendentious for the tragic element always springs up amidst the ruins of a mythic framework However tragedy is the least tendentious of all mythic forms As we have seen the aim of tragic inspiration is to reestablish the reciprocity of reprisals to restore the symmetry of violence in short to correct the tendentious aspect And Freuds approach takes the same line It reestablishes certain elements of reciprocity but it does not go so far as tragedy itself goes The Freudian approach is even more tendentious than tragedy is because Freud snares the modern inclination to shift all blame for violence onto others Thus Freud finds himself caught up in the giveandtake of reprisals in the dual role of model and obstacle and in the vicious cycle of mimetic desire That is the fallacy of the modern mind which even when it is either too evolved or too knowledgeable to claim immunity from all violent impulses invariably resorts to an ideal of nonviolence completely foreign to the Greek mind as a covertly violent criterion for all judgments and critical evaluations Like all biased pronouncements Freuds strictures on Greek tragedy ultimately turn against their author Ultimately it is Freud himself who appears guilty of refined hypocrisy And the modern critic in his concerted effort to undermine the structure of all religious moral and cultural distinctions ultimately brings these distinctions crashing down on his own head He sets himself up as the prophet of new insights and new ideas as the sole possessor of an infallible system of analysisand finds himself condemned to recapitulate all the ageold distinctions of difference Tiresias redivivusl The quality of tendentiousness is representative of the sacred difference that each faction strives to wrest from the other and that shifts from one side to the other with everincreasing speed as the rival insights come into contact It is a quality that perhaps applies to interpretation itself whether it is an analysis of Oedipus the King or a quarrel over psychoanalysis and other modern methodologies Ostensibly the sole object in dispute is the cultureincrisis of which each antagonist flatters himself he is the true champion Everybody is intent on diagnosing the illness in order to find a cure But in fact the illness is the other the other with his false diagnoses and poisonous prescriptions When real responsibilities vanish the game remains unchanged 206 Violence and the Sacred in fact it is all the better for being played without stakes with each contestant striving to outshine his neighbor rather than trying to shed real light on the supposed object of their concern All in all the modern crisis like all sacrificial crises can be defined as the elimination of differences The interplay of antagonisms actually does the eliminating without ever being recognized for what it truly is the increasingly feeble increasingly tragic intervention of an enfeebled difference This difference appears to be always growing but it fades away whenever someone tries to appropriate it Each faction is mystified by the isolated restructurings increasingly fragile and transitory which lend their support to each of the antagonists in turn The final degradation of the mythic element takes the form of a proliferation of rival and mutually destructive forms whose relationship to the myth itself is highly ambiguous These forms are demystifying as well as mythic that is they are mythic in the very nature of their demystification which is never illusory to be sure but is always restricted to the other myth The myths of demystification cling to the great collective myth and draw nourishment from it rather like worms feeding on a corpse Greek tragedy which acknowledges the influence of this process clearly has more to say about it than does psychoanalysis which claims immunity from it Only by studiously ignoring those texts that threaten to undermine their system do psychoanalysts maintain their complacency Although they concede that artistic beauty is worthy of reverence and awe they scornfully dismiss the actual work as fanciful effete narcoticthe antithesis of hard scientific truth Critics consider the work of art a passive object that will yield its secrets on command to all adherents of the latest form of absolute knowledge whatever that form may be As far as I can see this process of mystifying demystification has been fully comprehended by artists but never by psychoanalysts or sociologists What is most remarkable is the role played by literary critics Not infrequently they inveigh against the scientists for whatever hardheaded insights they may actually have contributed to an understanding of the creative process Yet at the same time they echo the scientists belief that literature is basically innocuous and ultimately meaningless and seem to share their a priori conviction that no work of literature has anv direct relation to reality We have on occasion observed Sophocles demystifying psychoanalysis but we shall never see psychoanalysis demystifying Sophocles In fact psychoanalytic thought has never really come to grips with Sophocles Only at his best as in the case discussed above does Freud manage to move even parallel to him Totem and Taboo and the Incest Prohibition 207 To examine a work of art from the perspective of the surrogate victim and its attendant mechanism is to consider it in terms of collective violence and to attempt to discover what the work omits as much if not moreas what it includes That is surely an essential first step in any critical venture Yet at first glance the task may seem futile any practical application to literature seems destined to end in broad generalities and esoteric abstractions Returning to the text of Freud however we find that such is not the case Here we encounter an omission that is conspicuous not to say astonishing if we take the context into account In any general discussion of Greek tragedy there is a tendency to refer either implicidy or explicidy to one particular work that exemplifies the genre This practice was initiated by Aristotle and is still in force today And when ones name is Sigmund Freud one has every reason to adhere to the convention And yet Freud did not do so It is of course Oedipus the King that springs to mind in connection with Freud and we have ourselves already had recourse to the play but Freud does not make the slightest allusion to itneither in the passage I have cited nor in the pages preceding and following it There are references to Attis Adonis Tammuz Mithra the Titans Dionysus Christianityin the name of demystification of coursebut there is no mention of Oedipus as a tragic hero nor any reference to the play about him It can be objected that Oedipus the King is after all only one tragedy among many nothing obliges Freud to make any specific reference to it The fact that it is not specifically referred to does not mean that Freud has specifically excluded it One can just as well conclude that he has simply incorporated this particular tragedy into his total picture of tragedy and thus taken it into consideration However this line of argument is not valid Once our attention has been drawn to the absence of the archetypal tragedy details come to mind that suggest that its absence is due neither to chance nor to accident On rereading Freuds definition of tragic gutlty we realize that it cannot be made applicable to Oedipus the King The hero has to bear the burden of what was known as tragic guilt the basis of that guilt is not always easy to find for in the light of our everyday life it is often no guilt at all This definition applies to some tragediesbut not to Oedipus the King There is nothing vague or indefinite about the source of Oedipus guilt at least not in the eyes of Freud and his followers Can it be that Freud did not think of Oedipus at this juncture that he simply forgot about himthat Oedipus slipped his mind It is easy 208 Violence and the Sacred to imagine what that voracious pack of neopsychoanalytic bloodhounds hot on the trail of Totem and Taboo will deduce from such a lapse or slip Far from seeing in Totem and Taboo a classic example in conformity with the usual diagnostic pattern of the return of a repressed subject they will undoubtedly recognize here the ultimate example of extreme repressionOedipuss surprising and momentous journey to the innermost recesses of the Freudian unconscious The Freud of Totem and Taboo then is in such a state that he has repressed all references to Oedipus Such a proposition is truly mindboggling Fortunately another possibility presents itself In the passage just quoted there occurs a modest qualifier that may be of importance In the light of our everyday life Freud cautions us tragic guilt is often no guilt at all The word often serves to warn us that the assertion is not invariably valid it admits the possibility of exceptional tragedies or at the very least of one exceptional tragedy That admission seems relevant here In at least one tragedy Freud is saying there is a case of tragic guilt that would be readily accepted as such in everyday existence it involves patricide and incest This modifying often is explicit it cannot be interpreted as ignoring Oedipus In fact there is reason to believe that it was inserted specifically with Oedipus in mind Throughout Totem and Taboo Oedipus is conspicuous by his absence The omission is not a natural or an unconscious one it is wholly conscious and deliberate We do not have to do with Freuds complexes here but with his conscious motiveswhich it should be said are a good deal more varied and interesting than his complexes We must ask ourselves why Freud has suddenly made Oedipus the object of a systematic act of exclusion If we examine this exclusion not only in its immediate context but in that of the work itself it seems even more troubling For what after all is the subject of Totem and Taboo Is Freud not dealing with the father the father of the primitive tribe who was destined to be murdered Freuds subject is patricidethe very crime Freud believed he had discovered at the heart of Greek tragedy a crime projected by the criminals onto their victims Certainly it is the very crime that first Tiresias and then all of Thebes attributed to the unfortunate Oedipus It would be hard to imagine a more economical and more telling argument in favor of the theory of tragedy advanced in Totem and Taboo than a simple comparison of this theory with the content of Oedipus the King And yet Freud says not a word about the play It is all we can do to keep from tugging at the sleeve of the celebrated Totem and Taboo and the Incest Prohibition 209 inventor of the Oedipuskomplex to remind him that there exists a tragedy that deals precisely with the subject of patricide Why did Freud choose to dispense with this striking example There is only one answer he could not use Oedipus the King in an interpretation that linked tragedy to an actual case of patricide without undermining his other standard interpretation the official psychoanalytic interpretation which presents Oedipus the King as a simple reflection of unconscious desires that formally excludes any execution of these desires Oedipus here appears in a strange relationship to his own complex As a primordial fatherfigure he has no father of his own and thus can scarcely be said to have any complexes regarding his paternity On a broader and more general plane we cannot view Oedipuss crimes in their true light observe patricide and incest in a context that includes phenomena of the scapegoat variety no matter how dimly they may appear without giving rise to questions that challenge the very basis of psychoanalytic thought A question mark cropped up in Freuds work and because he had no answer at hand he chose to ignore it A more prudent author would have simply suppressed all the passages in Totem and Taboo relating to tragedy Fortunately prudence was not one of Freuds characteristics It is the richness of his ideas their intuitive interest that Freud savored he therefore decided to preserve them all while carefully sidestepping any embarrassing allusions to Oedipus the King Freuds censorship of the Oedipus references was not exercised in any psychoanalytic sense but as an act of censorship pure and simple That is not to say however that his intention was to deceive Freud was fully confident that given time he would be able to answer all questions without violating the basic premises of psychoanalysis but as always he was in a hurry He therefore put the question aside for future consideration without realizing that the answer would never be forthcoming If Freud had attempted to resolve the contradiction he would probably have realized that neither his first nor his second reading of Oedipus the King had succeeded in coming to grips either with the Oedipus myth or with tragedy as a whole Neither repressed desire nor an actual act of patricide are really satisfactory answers and the obstinate duality of Freuds theories both here and throughout his work suggests that a certain distortion has taken place In avoiding the true problem Freud turned away from what was potentially the most profitable line of inquiry one that might finally have led him to the surrogate victim Behind Freuds exclusion of Oedipus from Totem 210 Violence and the Sacred and Taboo an initial act that constitutes a deliberate tactical maneuver it is possible to perceive a second inadvertent and unconscious act of exclusion that in fact determines the structure of the whole work Here again psychoanalysis offers no explanation And there is no point in asking psychoanalysis to explain an exclusion which among other things lays the groundwork for psychoanalysis itself The parentheses around Oedipus the King constitute a sort of critical hiatus a protective barrier surrounding the theory of psychoanalysis Earlier we had a glimpse of the same process operating in connection with mimetic desire there too it was a question of defending the Oedipus complex from possible attack In the hierarchy of Freudian themes this complex maintains a priveleged position that defines Freuds historical limitations as a thinker It represents the point beyond which deconstruction of the myth cannot go We find too the same contrast between Freud and his successors as we did in the case of mimetic desire Freud attempted to isolate and neutralize the insights that threatened to contaminate the purity of his doctrine but he was too gifted and too vital to reject them entirely and he had too great a love for intellectual exploration to suppress his most adventurous observations His followers however did not share this boldness They set out to eliminate all incongruities from his work and their censorship extended to the vital issue of mimetic desire on the one hand and on the other to all of Totem and Taboo The passages on tragedy seem never to have exerted any influence even the most devoutly Freudian of literary critics has failed to make use of them And yet it is these passages alone that contain Freuds most striking literary insight If the great advance of Totem and Taboo is also a kind of detour and the work seems to end in an impasse this is due to the heavy burden of psychoanalytic dogma with which the author approaches his text Naturally he is unwilling to relinquish this burden which he has come to regard as his most precious possession The major obstacle is the theme of the father By transforming the crucial revelation of collective murder into an act of patricide the paternal theme provides Freuds psychoanalytic adversaries and others with the very arguments they need to discredit his theoiy It is the paternal theme that skews Freuds interpretation of tragedy preventing him from settling the problem of incest interdiction in a wholly satisfactory manner As we have seen the intrusion of the collective murder into Totem and Taboo fails to answer the problems raised by the incest interdictions and can even be said to stand in the way of their solution It breaks the continuity between the sexual monopoly of the awesome Totem and Taboo and the Incest Prohibition 211 father figure and the historical strength of the interdictions In an initial effort to restore this continuity Freud resorts to a piece of juggling which however fails of its effect What up to then had been prevented by his the fathers actual existence was thenceforward prohibited by the sons themselves in accordance with the psychological procedure so familiar to us in psychoanalysis under the name of deferred obedience They revoked their deed by forbidding the killing of the totem the substitute for their father and they renounced its fruits by resigning their claim to the women who had now been set free They thus created out of their filial sense of guilt the two fundamental taboos of totemism which for that very reason inevitably corresponded to the two repressed wishes of the Oedipus complex13 Freud shows that he recognizes the fragility of this argument by immediately introducing a supplementary proof As is so often the case with this ingenious but hasty thinker these new arguments are not only additional supports for the old ones but they constitute a wholly fresh theory that surreptitiously challenges certain fundamental assumptions of psychoanalysis The prohibition of incest    has a powerful practical basis as well Sexual desires do not unite men but divide them Though the brothers had banded together in order to overcome their father they were all one anothers rivals in regard to the women Each of them would have wished like his father to have all the women to himself The new organization would have collapsed in a struggle of all against all for none of them was of such overmastering strength as to be able to take on his fathers part with success Thus the brothers had no alternative if they were to live together butnot perhaps until they had passed through many dangerous crisesto institute the law against incest by which they all alike renounced the women whom they desired and who had been their chief motive for dispatching their father14 In the first quotation the father has been dead only a short time and his memory pervades everything In the second his death has receded in time we might almost say that it is repeated afresh this time in Freuds imagination Freud sees himself following the avatars of the clan after the act of collective murder proceeding through time step by step In fact he is gradually disengaging himself from the confines of modern family life that have held him prisoner All family relation13 ibid p 143  Ibid p 144 272 Violence and the Sacred ships blur and fade away For instance it is no longer possible to determine the degree of concupiscence by the closeness of the blood tie All the women are now on the same level Each of them would have wished like his father to have all the women to himself Mothers and sisters become a cause of rivalry not because they are intrinsically more desirable but simply because they happen to be at hand Desire no longer seeks out a priveleged object Although this rivalry is initially sexual it eventually attains a scope and intensity that is hardly justified by sexual appetite alone Freud himself makes that clear No one can hope to emulate the great feats of the father for none of them was of such overmastering strength as to be able to take on his fathers part with success There are a thousand pretexts for such a rivalry because in the last analysis its sole object is the attainment of sovereign violence On one side there are only the women and on the other the men who are unable to divide the women among themselves The situation described by Freud has supposedly arisen because of the death of the dominant father but now everything takes place as if the father had never existed The emphasis has shifted to the enemy brothers who are virtually indistinguishable from one another and we now find ourselves caught up in the familiar process of reciprocal violence confronting the symmetrical patterns of the sacrificial crisis Freud here approaches the ultimate cause of the incest taboo as he moves away from his habitual psychoanalytical themes That is the way of tragedy itself the way of indirTerentiation that Freud as we have seen brings into Totem and Taboo with his description of the chorus of enemy brothers A crowd of people all with the same name and similarly attired The interdiction is no longer presented as a consequence of a psychological procedure so familiar to us in psychoanalysis but of the urgent necessity of preventing a struggle of all against all that would bring about the collapse of the society We are now dealing with a concrete fact Sexual desires do not unite men but divide them Freud does not make the slightest allusion to his initial theory Without seeming even to realize it he is clearing the scene of complexes and fantasies to make way for real functions which wTill now provide the basis for the interdictions Freud who contributed to so much of the confusion and misunderstanding concerning the nature of religion became in Totem and Taboo the first to proclaim the true function of incest interdictions And he was also the first to turn his back on his own revelations Totem and Taboo and the Incest Prohibition 213 GSfl THE SECOND THEORY is superior to the first in its explanation of the function of the prohibitions In discussing the origin of these prohibitions it asserts that the brothers eventually come to an amicable agreement concerning their mutual renunciation of the women However the absolute character of the prohibition excludes the possibility that it might originate in a negotiated peace If the men were indeed capable of arriving at some sort of mutual agreement it is certain that all the women would not have fallen under the same irrevocable taboo Some sort of division of the goods would surely have been arranged Freud suspected that in such circumstances violence was bound to triumph That was why he referred to the serious dissensions that would inevitably precede the final agreement and the forceful arguments that were meant to bring home to the warring brothers the gravity of their situation If violence is unleashed prohibitions become indispensable for without them human society would vanish Yet is there any reason why human society should not vanish Freud says nothing that makes a reconciliation necessary or even possiblea reconciliation that must be brought about by means of a prohibition as irrationar and affective to use Freuds terms as the prohibition concerning incest An antiincestuous social contract is hardly a convincing proposition and the theory that had such a promising beginning falters at its conclusion Although Freuds second theory marks an advance on the first in its explanation of the function of prohibitions it is less satisfactory than the first in regard to origins The true outcome was to have eluded the brothers it eluded Freud instead I have attempted to follow step by step the path that led from the first theory to the second In so doing I have focused on the dynamics of a line of thought that is ridding itself little by little of all cultural and family ties It is now clear that this line of thought never achieves its goal The second incest theory follows the same pattern as the passages on tragedy Both brothers and women are reduced to the anonymity of complete equality but the father retains his separateness Because he is dead he is immune from the operation of indifferentiation He is the only one who does not relinquish his family role in the course of the proceedings and unfortunately his is the crucial role Freud manages to defilialize the sons but he goes no further The line of thought that breaks off here needs to be drawn out to its conclusion the father has to be depaternalized To pursue Freuds train of thought to a conclusion does not involve 214 Violence and the Sacred rejecting the role of the murder whose importance is confirmed by ample ethnological evidence Rather it involves rejecting the role of the father transcending the family framework and the dogma of psychoanalysis The overbearing presence of the father figure intervenes constantly concealing the mechanism of religion and preventing Freud from articulating the true character of the sacrificial rites festivals and all the other evidence Every sentence that begins Psychoanalysis demonstrates    or Psychoanalysis has revealed    invariably evades the true explanation Psychoanalysis has revealed that the totem animal is in reality a substitute for the father and this tallies with the contradictor fact that though the killing of the animal is as a rule forbidden yet its killing is a festive occasionwith the fact that it is killed and not mourned15 In fact the father explains nothing If we hope to get to the root of the matter we must put the father out of our minds and concentrate on the fact that the enormous impression made on the community by the collective murder is not due to the victims identity per se but to his role as unifying agent In other words this impression derives from the wave of unanimity reestablished by the victims presence and directed against the victim It is this conjunction of by and against that explains the apparent contradictions of the religious practices the constant need to repeat the killing even though the victim is divine indeed because it is divine It is not the theme of collective murder that constitutes the weakness of Totem and Taboo but the mass of psychoanalytical material that obscures that theme If only Freud had shifted his attention away from the arguments that precede the murder and that he hoped would provide a motivation for it if only he had been willing to jettison his psychoanalytic explanations then he would have seen that the violence occurs without reason that the murder has no meaning outside itself Once the murder has been stripped of its associations with the father figure the reason for its tremendous impact on the community becomes plain as does the secret of its success of its ritual repetitions and the double judgment that invariably accompanies it To understand all this is to realize that the conclusion to the second theory which the enemy brothers are vainly trying to reach has already been found by Freud and indeed constitutes his main theme anything that prevents the act of murder from becoming merely an unalloyed operation of the surrogate victim also prevents it from taking place at its truly appropriate time at the endnot the beginningof the sacrificial crisis 15 Ibid p 141 Totem and Taboo and the Incest Prohibition 215 Only the surrogate victim is capable of bringing the inconclusive second theory to a conclusion only its intervention can put an end to the violence and effect a union of the two incest theories Instead of serving as a futile and even obstructive prologue to the crisis of the brothers the murder can play a crucial role at the end providing the resolution to the crisis oudined by Freud himself and a point of departure for the cultural order Indeed that murder must be the ultimate source of all incest prohibitions e4 UP TO THIS POINT I have limited my examination of incest prohibitions to the context of Totem and Taboo My reading of the work has led me to suppose that the roots of these prohibitions as of many other facets of the cultural order are embedded in generative violence Freud was the first to link the problem of prohibitions to that of sacrifice and the first who sought to resolve the two problems by means of the collective murder If Freuds explanation of sacrifice must be adjusted in favor of the surrogate victim then we must assume that the same will apply to his account of incest prohibitions But before I embark on this question I would like to make it clear that even though this adjustment may favor my own line of enquiry it does no violence to the basic premises of Freuds study It introduces no elements not already contained therein and in fact owes its origins to the inherent dynamism and suggestiveness of Freuds work Let us briefly recall the role played by the primitive horde in Totem and Taboo Darwins hypothesis offers a clearcut explanation of the incest prohibitions and it is obvious that Freuds initial attraction to the hypothesis stems from this fact The hypothesis appears in the course of an initial discussion of exogamy The second important hypothesis of Totem and Taboothis one wholly Freudsconcerns collective murder and must have been formulated somewhat later as a result of Freuds readings in ethnology Initially then the two hypotheses are independent of one another Darwin makes no mention of the collective murder on the other hand there is nothing relating to Darwins theory of the primitive horde in the ethnological material that suggested the theme of the collective murder Freud attempted to wed the two theories and the result was a mixture of history and prehistory whose arbitrary quality has frequendy been noted Equally dubious is Freuds claim to have extracted from cultural documents of relatively recent date material pertaining to an event supposedly unique and situated in a fabulous and distant past Freuds argument not only fails to carry conviction but also contributes nothing to the insights that form the true substance of the work If Freud took up the primitive horde theory because of the 216 Violence and the Sacred possibilities it offered for dealing with the problem of prohibitions it is hard to see why he did not renounce it once the murder concept by breaking the link between the sexual privilege of the primordial father and the prohibitions had for all practical purposes eliminated these possibilities Again if Freud meant to develop his murder theory he had no reason to cling to the horde which is hindered rather than helped by the concept of the murder Ultimately the two theories are incompatible and one must choose between them Because the best part of Totem and Taboo is devoted to a presentation of the murder theory and a demonstration that the murder is the consequence of all the religious and ethnological data at our disposal it is natural to assume that ultimately Freud would have opted for the murder theory Moreover the horde is irrelevant here its initial usefulness seems to have been dissipated However Freud made no such choice He kept the murder and declined to renounce the horde never realizing that the horde had now lost its raison detre The reason for this lapsus is clear the horde theory refers the collective murder to the sphere of the father figure Consequently the precious axioms of psychoanalysis are preserved The primitive horde is a perfect materialization of the psychoanalystic myth Once again we brush against invisible barriers beyond which Freuds logic never ventures Here again Freuds successors seem to emphasize the regressive aspect of his thought The murdered father1 theory of Totem and Taboo is clearly indefensible but the vulnerable element is not the murder but the father And although the arguments of Freuds successors have some merit if taken literally we cannot respect their rejection of the work as a whole While purporting to attack the weaknesses of Freuds concept they are in fact seeking to suppress its strengths It is at once paradoxical and highly significant that Freuds heirshis sons so to speakshould draw on one of their fathers principal weaknesses that timidity that they themselves share in order to purge his doctrine of all elements that are foreign to their own way of thinking Yet it is precisely those elements that constitute the truly important and innovative aspect of Totem and Taboo When the effort is made to separate true from false the false is invariably paraded as the true The error lies in the concept of the father and the application of psychoanalysis the truth lies in the concept of the collective murder and strange as it may seem in Freuds ethnology A fresh and constructive reading of the work should lead us to reject almost all the elements that psychoanalysts recognize as valid and to acknowledge the validity of those very elements that psychoanalysts reject Totem and Taboo and the Incest Prohibition 277 In the course of this investigation it has become clear that Totem ind Taboo is more compatible with the theory of the surrogate victim is the foundation of culture than is anv other modern work Thus in spite of the manifold difficulties created by the impossibilities in the Freudian theoryimpossibilities that had hitherto discredited itwe were able to acknowledge a great insight in Totem mid Taboo The overlapping of theories in Freuds work their profusion and multiplicity can only be interpreted as a sign of failure As soon as the surrogate victim is introduced into the picture the scattered fragments of Freuds speculations come together like pieces in a puzzle In their fragmentary state the Freudian analyses have little to tell us but when once they have been drawn together by means of the surrogate victim their impact appears momentous and it can hardly be claimed that this new unity was imposed from the outside We have only to cease regarding Freuds thought in terms of infallible dogma to see that he was always fundamentally concerned with the operation of the surrogate victim and was constantly though hesitatingly attempting to come to terms with that question I could easily extend my demonstration to other works of Freud These works should be analyzed in the same manner as we analyze rites For any cultural interpretation is ultimately only another form of rite as such it stems from the operation of the surrogate victim and can be fully systematized and analyzed only in its light The comparative approach should yield the common denominator of those works of Freud that complement without ever quite repeating or duplicating each other The many different elements that make up these related texts obscure their fundamental unity yet that unity lies near at hand Freuds Moses and Monotheism seems to complement Totem and Taboo in many respects Just as in Totem and Taboo we encounter prior to the murder a father and sonthat is a familyso in Moses and Monotheism we encounter prior to the murder the story of Moses and the Mosaic religionthat is society iMoses plays a role similar to that of the primordial father And the Hebrew people deprived of their prophet by Moses death resemble the group of brothers deprived of their father after the murder described in Totem and Taboo Once again all the possible implications of the act of collective violence can be set forth in advance If we deduct all those that pertain exclusively to Totem and Taboo on the one hand and on the other all those with relevance only to Aloses and Monotheism that is the implications for the family in the former work and for the people the nation and the Jewish religion in the latter work we find that we are 218 Violence and the Sacred left with a single common denominator the metamorphosis of reciprocal violence into generative violence by means of the murder of somebody no matter nxhoma figure chosen as it were at random Similarly in order to bring about a synthesis of the two Freudian theories on the origin of incest prohibitions the collective murder must be taken out of the familial framework of the first theory and incorporated into the societal framework of the second theory My own theories are based upon this operation of double synthesis In fact their primary concern is that point where all the Freudian interpretations examined here begin to converge No sooner does the generative violence make its appearance caught up in the Freudian dynamics than we begin to anticipate the slight modifications that permit it to assume its function as a universal bonda function that in turn derives from its role as a universal structural support We are not indulging in impressionistic literary criticism but in objective research The fact that we can proceed further than Freud down a path of his own choosing offers us valuable insight into his wrork It becomes possible to finish phrases left dangling by the author to determine why and when his thought went astray in short to place him precisely In his Essay on Psychoanalysis Freud comes as close to the concept of mimetic desire as he does to that of generative violence in Totem and Taboo and Moses and Monotheism In each instance the distance from the objective is the same as is the margin of error the basic standpoint remains unchanged Desire for most modern thinkers is anchored in an object In order to perceive the implications of an infinitely mobile mimesis we must realize that the boundless potentiality of violence can only be contained by the operation of the surrogate victim After all we cannot postulate the existence in man of a desire radically disruptive of human relations without simultaneously postulating the means of keeping this desire in check To free ourselves forever from the illusions of humanism there is only one requirement wrhich happens to be the very one that modern men refuse to meet we must acknowledge mankinds thorough dependence on religion This it is plain Freud was not inclined to do He was not alone in his subservience to an increasingly enfeebled humanist ideal he had no notion of the intellectual revolution for which he was paving the way      HOW ARE WE TO IMAGINE the birth of cultural prohibitions It must be thought of concurrently with all other cultural births The divine epiphany the universal upsurge of the monstrous double engulfs the community and simultaneously makes its presence felt at all points of conflict It passes between the enemy Totem and Taboo and the Incest Prohibition 219 brothers who fall back thunderstruck Whatever the pretext for the conflict may have beenfood weapons land womenthe antagonists suspend their struggle now and forever Henceforth everything touched by the sacred violence belongs to the gods as such it becomes the object of a most solemn prohibition The antagonists have been sobered and thoroughly frightened From now on they will do everything possible to keep from relapsing into reciprocal violence Moreover divine anger has taught them that preventive measures are necessary Wherever violence occurs a prohibition is proclaimed The sentence weighs on all the women who figured as prizes in the rivalry that is on all women who live within a groupnot because they are intrinsically more desirable but because they are near at hand and therefore likely objects of rivalry The prohibition always covers the closest instances of consanguinity but its outer limits are not necessarily confined to blood relations Both the principle of prohibition and the forms it takes are not without their practical uses It would be untrue to say that they were designed to deal with an imaginary situation on the contrary they serve to prevent people from being caught up in violent mimesis As we saw in the previous chapter the prohibitions of primitive peoples display a knowledge of violence and its ways that surpasses our modern comprehension The reason is clear the prohibitions were dictated by violence itself by the violent manifestations of a previous crisis and they are fixed in place as a bulwark against similar outbursts If the prohibitions seem evenly matched with the violence they are directed against that is because in the final analysis the two are one and the same That explains why in times of crisis the prohibitions ultimately contribute to the very violence they are designed to suppress Like any other form of sacrificial prophylaxis prohibitions can on occasion turn against their users All the evidence seems to confirm the proposal set forth at the outset of this work that sexuality is part of the larger problem of violence and the sacred Sexual prohibitions like all other prohibitions are sacrificial in nature and all legitimate sexuality is sacrificial Strictly speaking between members of the same community legitimate sexuality exists no more than legitimate violence in the community The prohibitions involving incest and those directed against murder or ritual killing among members of the same community have a common origin and function That is why they resemble one another and why in many cases as Robertson Smith has pointed out they cover exacdy the same ground Like blood sacrifice legitimate sexuality that of matrimonial 220 Violence and the Sacred unions never chooses its victims among those who live together The regulations governing marriage resemble the regulations governing the choice of sacrificial victims All these regulations serve to endow both sexuality and violence with the same centrifugal force In many instances the sacrificial deviations of sexuality and violence are virtually indistinguishable Marriage vows can be duly attended by ritualized violence analogous to other forms of ritual warfare This systematized violence resembles the endless cycle of revenge that might well rage inside if there were no substitute for it outside the community and the reciprocal exchange of violence with outsiders is one with the exchange of women that provides men with sexual objects from outside the community The problem is always the same violence is both the disease inside and the cure outside Violence like sexual desire must be forbidden wherever its presence is incompatible with communal existence Even today legitimized sexuality in the West reveals traces of its sacrificial character The sexual relation of husband and wife is the central and fundamental issue of family life After all it is the origin of family lifeand yet it is kept out of sight and plays no part strictly speaking in family life As far as the closest relatives particularly the children are concerned the sexual relation of husband and wife does not exist It is sometimes as thoroughly hidden as that most secret son of violence generative violence itself Psychoanalysis is wrong I believe to attribute to young children a knowledge of parental sexuality Surrounding this legitimized sexuality is a vast expanse of forbidder territory defined by the whole gamut of sexual prohibitions Withii this territory all sexual activity sexual allusions and erotic stimulant are forbidden So within the immediate environs of the temple and ii the area surrounding the place of sacrifice any form of violence i strictly forbidden Beneficial and lifegiving but also dangerous regu lated sexual violence like ritual murder is surrounded by a veritabl buffer zone If it were granted free rein to propagate itself within th community it would become evil and destructive Primitive societies are generally more hemmed in by prohibitior than Western society has ever been However many of them ai unfamiliar with some of our own particular prohibitions We mu take care not to interpret the relative liberty of these primitive peopl as presenting an ideological contrast as standing in direct opposition t the repression characteristic of our own society especially and mo notoriously in the sexual realm The vast importance attributed i sexuality by humanists and naturalists is after all a modern and Wes ern phenomenon In primitive societies wherever sexual activity is n Totem and Taboo and the Incest Prohibition 221 ther legitimized that is seen as ritual either in a strict or a broad sense nor prohibited it seems to be regarded as a matter of little or no importance in other words it is too trivial to provoke internal violence This is the case in certain societies with regard to the sexual activities of children and unmarried adolescents or with regard to sexual dealings with foreigners as well as naturally the sexual activities among foreigners Prohibitions serve a basic function They maintain a sort of sanctuary at the heart of the community an area where that minimum of nonviolence essential to the survival of the children and the communitys cultural heritageessential in short to everything that sustains mans humanityis jealously preserved If prohibitions capable of performing this function actually exist one can hardly attribute them to the beneficence of Nature that good angel of complacent humanism the last relic of those optimistic theologies engendered by the deterioration of historical Christianity It should now be apparent that humanitys very existence is due primarily to the operation of the surrogate victim We know that animals possess individual braking mechanisms against violence animals of the same species never fight to the death but the victor spares the life of the vanquished Mankind lacks this protection Our substitution for the biological mechanism of the animals is the collective cultural mechanism of the surrogate victim There is no society without religion because without religion society cannot exist Ethnologists should long since have drawn on their cumulative evidence to explain the function of these prohibitions and even to discover their origins The act of violence performed in the course of a rite or a festival points the way clearly enough for it hinges on sacrificial practices or on totemic ceremonies And if we also examine the disastrous or merely disturbing consequences attributed to nonritualized violations we see that they always boil down to halfmythical halfreal manifestations of the sacrificial crisis Thus what motivates prohibition is the fear of violence Just because this violence can be disguised behind a contagious illness a drought or a flood we do not have the right to dismiss this fear as superstition1 Modern philosophers invariably choose as representative the most irrational and bizarre at any rate to modern eyes aspects of religious prohibitions Thus they manage to convince themselves that religion has no connection with reality This misconception cannot prevail much longer The real function of prohibition was brought to light by Freud and although it was almost immediately discarded bv him it has recentlv been reformu222 Violence and the Sacred lated with great precision by Georges Bataille To be sure Bataille is primarily inclined to treat violence in terms of some rare and precious condiment the only spice still capable of stimulating the jaded appetite of modern man Yet on occasion Bataille is able to transcend the decadent estheticism he has so fervently espoused and explain quite simply that the prohibition eliminates violence and our violent impulses including those resulting from our sexual drives destroy our inner calm without which human consciousness cannot exist16 16 Georges Bataille VErotimie Paris 1965 p 43    Chapter Nine LeviStrauss Structuralism and Marriage Laws CJKM1 T H E U N 1 T O F STRUCTURE from which a kinship       system is built up is the group which I call an elementary family consisting of a man and his wife with their child or children The existence of the elementary family creates three special kinds of social relationships that between parent and child that between children of the same parents siblings and that between husband and wife as parents of the same child or children    The three relationships that exist within the elementary family constitute what 1 call the first order Relationships of the second order are those which depend on the connection of two elementary families through a common member and are such as fathers father mothers brother wifes sister and so on In the third order are such as fathers brothers son and mothers brothers wife Thus we can trace if we have the genealogical information relationships of the fourth fifth or nth order1 In outlining the basic premises of his own research A R RadcliffeBrown sets forth the principles that prevailed in the study of kinship before LeviStrauss arrived on the scene In an article entitled Structural Analysis in Linguistics and in Anthropology2 LeviStrauss quotes the above passage as the counter position to his own methodology which was to set the pattern for structuralist studies of kinship According to LeviStrauss the elementary family is based on marriage and is therefore not an irreducible unit Far from being elementary it is by definition composite It is to be regarded as an end point rather than a point of departure the result of an exchange between two groups that share no biological affiliations Kinship is allowed to establish and perpetrate itself only through specific forms of marriage In other words the relationships which RadcliffeBrown calls relation1 A R RadclifFeBrown The Study of Kinship Systems Journal of the Royal Anthropological Institute 71 19412 2 Claude LeviStrauss Structural Anthropology trans Claire Jacobson and Brooke Grundfest New York 1963 154 224 Violence and the Sacred ships of the first order are a function of and depend on those which he considers secondary and derived The essence of human kinship is to require the establishment of relations among what RadcliffeBrown calls elementary families Thus it is not the families isolated terms which are truly Elementary but rather the relations between those terms3 We must be wary of common sense which never loses sight of the actual biological relationship linking RadcliffeBrowns elementary family and which refuses to regard the system as a system Of course the biological family is ubiquitous in human society But what confers upon kinship its sociocultural character is not what it retains from nature but rather the essential way in which it diverges from nature A kinship system does not consist in the objective ties of descent or consanguinity between individuals It exists only in human consciousness it is an arbitrary system of representations not the spontaneous development of a real situation4 The arbitrary element is assimilated to what has been called here the symbolic character of the system Two entitiesin this case two individualsare brought together not by necessity but by symbolic thought two crosscousins let us say are joined in marriage and the circumstances that necessitated the marriage can be attributed to social convention rather than to any real need The fact that a type of marriage permitted or even required in one society is formally forbidden in another makes this point clear Are we therefore to conclude that kinship systems in general are essentially unnatural As the last quotation from LeviStrauss demonstrates his pronouncements on this question are more cautious and more finely shaded than some of his critics have led us to believe After explaining that the kinship system is not the spontaneous development of a real situation he remarks that this certainly does not mean that the real situation is automatically contradicted or that it is to be simply ignored RadcliffeBrown has shown in studies that are now classic that even systems which are apparently extremely rigid and artificial such as the Australian systems of marriageclasses take biological parenthood carefully into account5 The point seems clear enough in this context Yet it is the very point that could be misinterpreted in different circumstances through a hastyr or overzealous application of LeviStrausss own discoveries LeviStrausss homage to RadcliffeBrown whose views he had convincingly refuted a few lines further back is no mere formality 3 Ibid p 50  Ibid  Ibid LeviStrauss Structuralism and Marriage Laws 225 But there is reason to question whether LeviStrausss acknowledgment deals adequately with the issue Kinship systems we are informed even those which are apparently extremely rigid and artificial    take biological parenthood carefully into account That is certainly true as far as it goes There is however a good deal more to be said Men can take into account only those concepts that are already accessible to their understanding The phrase implies that the concept of biological kinship exists outside the kinship system that is outside culture This notion strikes me as inconceivable We must take care not to confuse two distinct realities 1 the fact of biological kinship the actual process of human reproduction and 2 an understanding of these same procedures a recognition of the functioning of generation and consanguinity It is obvious that men must always behave according to the first reality insofar as they cannot reproduce themselves by any other means than those prescribed by the laws of biology This is as true for men living within a culture as for those who might live in a state of nature where promiscuity would be the rule As for the second reality however that is a very different matter for if sexual promiscuity prevailed the conditions would not exist that make possible the discovery of biological laws It might be objected that I am drifting into abstractions On the contrary my purpose is to expose a speculative assumption tacitly accepted and wholly without basis that is part and parcel of the modern naturalist myththe belief that a particular affinity exists between the state of nature and biological truth or even scientific truth in general There is then no difference between nature and culture in regard to the mere biological facts of human reproduction In regard to the understanding of these facts however a difference assuredly exists and it is to the detriment of nature In order to appreciate the truth of this statement we need only consider what happens to a litter of cats left to breed at random The result inevitably is a hopelessly tangled network of marriage alliances blood relationships and inlaw relationships that would confound even the most assiduous student of elementary or as we would say nuclear families No matter how bewildering such a spectacle might be it would not rid us of the conviction that the three types of family relationships described by RadcliffeBrown are indeed distinct and do exist Even our most advanced thinkers cannot persuade us that the distinction between father and son brother and sister and mother and daughter are mere figments of our deluded senses or the products of some deeprooted obsession fostered in our imaginations by a repressive cultural order Once the facts regarding reproduction have been established it 226 Violence and the Sacred is impossible to understand how they could ever have been misunderstood It should now be apparent that the establishment of basic biological facts requires the formal recognition of the three distinct relationships marriage direct descent and consanguinitydefined by RadcliffeBrown and that this formal recognition is dependent on a real separationthat is it is based on incest prohibitions and kinship systems Kinship systems then are essential to the ordering of biological data There is no kinship system no matter how rigid and artificial that will not serve this function As LeviStrauss has observed the common basis of all kinship systems is the recognition of a firm distinction between marriage and consanguinity Although kinship systems vary greatly in scope their premises remain the same marriage is always forbidden between parents and children and between brothers and sisters The exceptions to this pattern are so rare and so special usually having to do with ritual that for all practical purposes they can be regarded as exceptions that prove the rule No matter how harsh and excessive certain marriage ordinances may appear no matter how arbitrary and extreme their accompanying prohibitions the reverse aspect of these rules may seem the basis of the system remains stable and comprehensible Every kinship system defines the licit and the illicit in sexual matters so as to exclude from the reproductive process those sharing a parentchild or brothersister relationship Therefore all those who submit to its governance are obliged to acknowledge the basic facts of human reproduction There is reason to believe that in the state of natural promiscuity the connection between the sexual act and the birth of children or even perhaps the very idea of conception would go unrecognized Only through the establishment of incest prohibitions could man hope to obtain the quasiexperimental conditions necessary to the recognition of the reproductive process Only through incest prohibitions could man introduce into his sexual life the stabilizing elements and systematic exclusions without which the relevant linkages and comparisons could not be made Prohibitions then serve as a necessary controlling factor permitting man to recognize the results of sexual activity through comparison with the sterility of abstinence Of course it is impossible to reconstruct the historical chain of events But that is not my concern here My sole purpose is to carry the LeviStraussian critique of the nuclear family a little further than LeviStrauss himself has chosen to do The three types of relationships that constitute the nuclear family are the very ones that must be isolated and made explicit in order to establish the basic biological premises and these relationships are in fact isolated and made explicit in all LeviStrauss Structuralism and Marriage Laws 227 kinship systems The very concept of the nuclear family would be inconceivable without kinship systems however it is always possible to deduce this concept at least in theory from any imaginable kinship system because the distinctions that define the concept are an integral part of such systems It thus becomes clear that the nuclear family is the product rather than the constituent of the kinship system and to a far greater extent than ethnologists have hitherto suspected That is why it is not sufficient to say that kinship systems even the most complex and artificial of them take biological kinship into account such systems are responsible for the discovery of biological kinship and their existence conditions all understanding of it In short the system itself has priority over the relationships it establishes If everything must be seen in connection with the system that is because the system truly comes first even as regards biology and not because the system could theoretically flout biological laws In fact the system never flouts biology at least as long as it adheres to the strict separation of marriage and consanguinity One must not think of the system as stemming from its results for the system alone makes these results possible The refusal to regard biology as a starting point is made not because biology belongs in the realm of nature but because on the contrary it belongs entirely to culture and is deduced from systems of which the nuclear family is the smallest common denominator The system is all of a piece and must be viewed as such We must take care not to be distracted by its multiple variations which in no way affect its essence The three types of relationship that compose the nuclear family all have real biological counterparts yet they depend for their definition on incest prohibitions In other words if there were no incest prohibitions there would be no biological laws But the purpose of the system is clearly not to uncover biological truths Such truths are not the only ones set forth by the system they are only part of a vaster statement For that reason they must not be taken as the point of departure The proposition developed here takes no particular stand on the controversial question Are there cultures that are ignorant of the biology of human reproduction I would venture to say however that in its handling of native testimony our theory can accomodate the skeptical approach of contemporary researchers as well as the positive approach of their predecessors The possibility does indeed exist that certain cultures despite incest prohibitions have never discovered the connection between the sexual act and childbirth Such a theory has been proposed by a number of ethnologists including Malinowski it is based on long and intimate contact with native life and there is reason to doubt whether the contemporary reaction against it is justified We 228 Violence and the Sacred are asked to believe that these ethnologists were hoodwinked by their informants who were simply pretending ignorance on the subject of conception This skeptical approach is ostensibly based on a new esteem for the intellectual capacities of primitive man but it may well stem from yet another and still more insidious form of ethnocentrism There is something vaguely demagogic about an appeal to common sense couched in these terms Look here you surely dont believe that there are men so stupid that they cant see the connection between sex and procreation Its just cultural provincialism that makes us assume that sort of thing whenever we encounter someone a bit different from ourselves As I have already said the field of inquiry of this book does not extend to this particular question nor would its answer affect my argument I only wish to point out that modern attacks on the previous generation of anthropologists are inspired by intellectual attitudes that can only perpetuate an old tendency to remove basic biological truths from the domain of culture and reattribute them to nature The appeal to common sense the use of such daunting phraseology as it is selfevident that   fits all too well with the misguided belief that kinship systems take biological facts into account independently of their other concerns More generally we encounter here a still mythic view of nature one that sees nature as more receptive than culture to scientific verities In fact there is no truth no matter how elementary that is not mediated by culture The great book of Nature is an enigma one can only approach obliquely  Q a  4 THE SIGNS OF HESITANCY and equivocation that we detect in LeviStrausss efforts to situate a knowledge of true biological relationships within the framework of the kinship system clearly stern from an inclination almost automatic today to exclude scientific concepts from the company of myths rituals and kinship systems We are less concerned here with the particular doctrine which moreover displays certain inconsistencies set forth by LeviStrauss in the article cited above than with the implicit principles that govern his thinkingand that are in fact almost universal suppositions The object of our own search remains our intellectual attitude toward the nuclear family which remains an obstacle even after LeviStrauss if we now treat our own privileged treatment of it as nothing but an arbitrary prejudice That kinship systems do not ignore or contradict biological kinship but rather take them carefully into account is not selfevident to presentday thinkers It is difficult to admit that our own knowledge of the basic facts of biology issues from the same thought process that LeviStrauss Structuralism and Marriage Laws 229 produced the most arbitrary and artificial distinctions of kinship systems Yet in both instances we have to do with the same type of intellectual operation the same process of symbolic thought the gathering of and distinguishing between entities whose union and separation are not made obvious in nature Nonetheless it is clear that all the products of symbolic thought cannot be considered equivalent There is such a thing as false symbolic thought for example the assumption that childbirth is the result of a womans possession by spirits as well as true symbolic thought for example the assumption that childbirth is the result of the sexual union of man and woman There is no thought that is not symbolic in the structuralist sense of the word Nevertheless it is no more appropriate for us to employ the term today as a synonym for false than it was appropriate in the past to employ it as a synonym for true LeviStrauss was the first to emphasize that all cultures contain an enormous store of knowledge that is useful because it is grounded in the truth If this were not the case these cultures would not have survived Whatever their differences then kinship systems are such that they cannot disregard the basic biological facts though in primitive cultures these facts are somewhat lost in a maze of other distinctions All these distinctions are of a piece that is they make up a system Our tendency to grant prime consideration to biological matters lead us to misunderstand the systematic aspect of the system To yield to this tendency is to produce elements that do not adhere inexplicable aberrations and exceptions that betray our inability to read the system correctly The structuralists are surely right in urging their ethnologist colleagues to check their compulsion to take biological facts as a point of departure Why has this compulsion become second nature to us Because our own system corresponds exactly to that of the nuclear family It reduces the principle of exogamy to its simplest form and requires in consequence only the minimum number of prohibitions necessary to bring out the basic facts of generation This coincidence must be kept in mind when we consider the basic differences between our society and primitive societies Nowadays it is often said that the concept of the modern family is just as arbitrary as the assumptions of other kinship systems That is both true and false A phenomenon can be arbitrary in relation to something and not arbitrary in relation to something else As far as the facts of procreation are concerned it is true that our system is as arbitrary as any other For as far as real biological functioning is concerned it scarcely matters whether a system forbids a man to marry either 1 his mother his sisters his daughters and any of the women of tribe X or 2 his 230 Violence and the Sacred mother his sisters and his daughters only The biological machinery works neither better nor worse in the first case than in the second and it might work just as well pace Westerrnarck if there were no restrictions whatsoever In regard to the true facts of generation then the verdict is plain all kinship systems are equally arbitrary Differences do exist however between the nuclear family system and all other systems If it is true that all svstems have a certain didactic value in regard to biological knowledge our system is certainly preeminent in this regard There are no longer any prohibitions in it that do not bring a basic relationship to light and there is no basic biological relationship that is not revealed by a prohibition This difference between our own and other systems may appear slight Our extreme reduction of prohibitions may serve to underline certain determined facts and bring them into sharper relief but it discloses nothing that more complex systems could not also disclose The biological example thus can suggest the relative singularity of our own system but cannot demonstrate it I began by emphasizing the biological question in order to dispose of an important stumbling block at the outset namely the confusion between fact and knowledge It was necessary to select the simplest most accessible example by which to demonstrate the ability of symbolic thought even at its most mythic to uncover scientifically significant relationships and differencesan ability that would remain unperceived by cultural relativism But biology is too rudimentary an example to continue with Let us turn our attention to another realm that of the cultural sciences and try to demonstrate that my approach provides ethnology with a new and fertile field of activity For LeviStrauss the language of kinship is a system of rules that establishes a circuit of exchange between exogamic groups Each time a group transfers one of its women to another group the beneficiary group will respond by transferring one of its own women either to the first group or to a third group depending on the requirements of the system This response constitutes a new appeal which will be answered accordingly The circle may be large or small but it always closes itself The questions and responses emanating from the system always follow the same order at least in principle Although this constitutes a language in the structuralist sense it fails to meet Chomskys criteria For him an essential trait is missing the infinite creativity of a true language the constant potential for inventing new phrases and expressing things never before expressed Thus we should bear in mind that the language of kinship is incomplete and also that it is no longer spoken in certain societies most particularly our own A system that restricts its prohibitions to a bare LeviStrauss Structuralism and Marriage Laws 231 minimum as does ours suppresses all positive rules In other terms it reduces the language of matrimonial exchange to nothing Wherever modern society is found marriages are no longer confined to a determined matrimonial circuit That does not mean of course that exogamy has vanished Not only does it still exist but it manages to bring together the most disparate groups even transcending the formidable barriers of racial economic and national prejudice If sufficient information were available we could evaluate the mediative role of such cultural manifestations as clothing styles entertainment and so forth in determining marriage alliances From the viewpoint of scientific determinism exogamy is certainly a determined factor but it is no longer determined by the mediation of socioreligious prescriptions to which everyone can and must refer The factors influencing these unions no longer possess a purely matrimonial significance Kinship no longer possesses a language of its own And there is no code of conduct telling people how to behave toward others and what behavior to expect in return for expectations assume the form of statistics and no longer apply to individual cases The linguistic metaphor must not be allowed to distract us from these essential differences Imperfect as it may be the assimilation of the system to a language is a precious tool even in the case of primitive systems as long as we remain within the framework of these systems It can help us to understand the difference between all these systems and our own relative lack of system As everyone knows the main obstacle to learning a foreign language is ones mother tongue Our command of our native idiom is probably less firm than its command of us and it displays a certain jealous possessiveness by making it difficult for us to acquire any other language Childrens capacity to assimilate languages depends on their ability to forget And the greatest linguists often have no tongue they can any longer call their own The fact that we have eliminated the last vestiges of a matrimonial language undoubtedly has something to do with our particular interest in those who continue to speak such languages as well as with our exceptional ability to decipher and classify them Our society can learn to speak all the kinship languages because it speaks none of them Not only do we read all those systems that actually exist but we even invent those that do not We can produce an infinite number of systems because we have the matrix of all exogamic languages in our grasp Between each of the systems and the system of systems between the kinship languages and LeviStrausss own language in The Elementary Structures of Kinship the same differences exist as between the traditional structuralist concept of language and Chomskys concept 232 Violence and the Sacred From this we can only conclude that our ethnological essence must be in some way related to our vocations as ethnologists linguists and more generally fieldworkers in the realm of culture Clearly our kinship system alone is not responsible for our ethnological inclinations rather the two phenomena are parallel The only society that has given itself over to the pursuit of ethnological knowledge happens to be one that has confined its system of prohibitions to the nuclear family We cannot regard this fact as simple coincidence In order to speak the language of scholarly research we must first lay aside the language of rites and kinship passing through the intermediary dialects of cultural activities in their broadest sense One stage follows the other without a break and at no point do the elements of sacrificial misapprehension wholly disappear Nonetheless the elements of comprehension increase in number value and coherence If ethnology is to become a true science it must reflect on its own principles and that reflection must transcend the limits of ethnology to take in the sort of society that produces ethnologistsalong with other types of men such as romantic heroes In ethnological literature the society that gives rise to ethnologists is always treated as it were in parentheses The reasons for this treatment can be traced back to the assumption that this society has nothing in common with primitive societies Today when it is boldly asserted that our own society is only one among many differing from other societies only in the way that all societies differ this attitude has not vanished but has become implicit rather than explicit This modern view is demonstrably false And if we seek more from ethnology than a means by which to quell the arrogance of our fellow Westerners we will have to face the fact that our kinship system cannot be put on the same level as the systems of aboriginal Australians or the CrowOmahas In our system there is nothing arbitrary in the forms of knowledge to which we feel ourselves bound We must not succumb to an antiethnocentrism which because it diverts us from essentials has a somewhat sacrificial character Antiethnocentrism is the final and parodoxical but ultimately logical maneuver of ethnocentrism itself  Q A 4 CONTEMPORARY THINKERS have drawn attention to the largely arbitrary character of cultural systems Most of the propositions that form these systems are neither true symbolic thought or false symbolic thought in the sense of the two examples offered on page 229 but generally belong to a third category they have no reality oustide the cultures that give rise to them An example is the proposition that crosscousins have a particular affinity for matrimony LeviStrauss Structuralism and Marriage Laws 233 This body of arbitrary elements is the original sin of human thought and it seems to increase as our skill in uncovering and interpreting these elements improves We cannot blame the researchers for minimizing or even disregarding the elements of truth that lie hidden amidst the arbitrary Symbolic thought in general is equated to mythic thought and thus occupies a position some thinkers believe is privileged but one that proves in the long run both deceptive and unproductive for it has lost all link with reality The cultural heritage of humanity is regarded with suspicion Its only interest lies in its demystificarionthat is in providing the demystifier with a chance to display his forensic skills Humanity we are told has fallen victim to a vast mystification unrecognized until now This is cultural nihilism and it is often associated with a fetishistic cult of science Because we have discovered the original sin of human thought we think ourselves free of it What is now needed is a radically different mode of thought a new science that will allow us to appreciate the absurdity of all previous thinking And because this lie was until recently immune from detection the new scientific approach must be altogether unconnected with the past Inevitably it will take the shape of a unique discovery by some inspired being who has little in common with ordinary mortals or even with his own past In severing the cord that attached us to the matrix of all mythic thought this liberator of humanity will have delivered us from dark ancestral falsehood and led us into the luminous world of truth Our hard and pure science is to be the result of a coupure epistemologique an epistemological revolution that is totally unexpected and for which we are entirely unprepared This scientific angelism springs from a deeprooted reluctance philosophical and even religious in origin to admit that truth can coexist with the arbitrary and perhaps even derive from it Certainly such an idea runs counter to our habitual modes of thought And the proposition that true thought and socalled mythic thought are one and the same seems nothing short of scandalous Perhaps it is because there are so few certain truths in the domain of culture that we are so eager to have the origins clear easily understood and accessible to reason The dualism of science and nonscience dates from the beginning of the scientific era and has assumed a great variety of forms It grows more acute when we approach a foreign culture and are unable to grasp it It is undoubtedly what prompted LeviStrauss to express mild astonishment that even the most artificial of kinship systems carefully took into account biological facts In The Savage Mind LeviStrauss attempted to formulate this dualism in highly attenuated and nuanced 234 Violence and the Sacred form under the categories of savage thought and bricolage on the one hand and the thought of the engineers on the other We find in the work of LeviStrauss a strong tendency to relegate truth either to the domain of natural thought or the domain of engineering or else to a loosely defined combination of the two that he designates as naturalist thought In his article on structural analysis for instance LeviStrauss asserts that the study of kinship systems obliges us to renounce naturalistic thoughtas if it were not symbolic toonot because this mode of thought is intrinsically false but because on the contrary it adheres too closely to the truth and is thus incapable of taking into account the fantasies of symbolic thought Structural ethnology thereby assumes a transitional and transitory quality it is seen as a detour that uses savage thought against itself in order to dissolve it to banish the hallucinations of our culture and clear the way for the union of nature and science All these questions converge on a fundamental question the origin of symbolic thought And if symbolic systems are never the spontaneous development of an actual situation if there is a rupture between nature and culture then the question becomes pressing LeviStrauss and the structuralists in general acknowledge this problem of origins only in an abstract fashion The passage from nature to culture they say is assured by the permanent traits of human nature the problem is a false one falling outside the domain of science The myths which falsely dramatize this passage by means of imaginary catastrophes only serve to conceal its true nature Totem and Taboo is seen in this view as another origin myth with little to offer beyond a certain curiosity value The work should in short be treated like any other myth It might be well to return to the closing lines of Structural Analysis in Linguistics and in Anthropology because of what they say and fail to say about the viewpoints we are trying to assess here and also because of the curious note of hesitancy they reveal Most untypically 6 The French term bricolage as employed here by LeviStrauss has no English equivalent The best we can do is to refer to LeviStrausss own discussion of the term in The Savage Mind Chicago 1966 There still exists among ourselves an activity which on the technical plane gives us quite a good understanding of what a science we prefer to call prior rather than primitive could have been on the plane of speculation This is what is commonly called bricolage in French In its old sense the verb bricoler applied to ball games and billiards to hunting shooting and riding It was however always used with reference to some extraneous movement a ball rebounding a dog straying or a horse swerving from its direct course to avoid an obstacle And in our own time the bricoleur is still someone who works with his hands and uses devious means compared with those of a craftsman    It might be said that the engineer questions the universe while the bricoleur addresses himself to a collection of oddments left over from human endeavors that is only a subset of the culture pp 1617 19Trans LeviStrauss Structuralism and Marriage Laws 235 the problem raised by the advent of symbolic thought is here viewed as a real problem though we cannot be sure whether the problem has already been resolved Although it may be legitimate or even inevitable to fall back upon a naturalistic interpretation in order to understand the emergence of symbolic thinking once the latter is given the nature of the explanation must change as radically as the newly appeared phenomenon differs from those which have preceded and prepared it7 If symbolic thinking is a given is this because we grasp its emergence or on the contrary because we do not Does its emergence pass unnoticed Does it take the form of a silent mutation as many previous references either assert or imply or is it a real discernible event The preceding passage seems to lean toward the second possibility permitting us to view the symbolic advent as a legitimate and even inevitable subject of inquiry But what are those phenomena that preceded and prepared this event How must we envision a line of inquiry apparently committed to the naturalist interpretation LeviStrauss is the first to raise the essential question even though he does so indirectly and one might almost say inadvertently The reader knows my response to the question My task now is to show or at least to suggest that this is the only approach capable of exposing the deficiency of a contemporary mode of thought that circles around the problem of origins without ever coming to grips with itthat in fact foregoes the opportunity to come to grips with it in favor of pure formalism The origin of symbolic thought lies in the mechanism of the surrogate victim such has been the burden of my argument particularly in my analyses of the myths of Oedipus and Dionysus It is a fundamental instance of arbitration that gives rise to the dual presence of the arbitrary and the true in all symbolic systems Collective murder restores calm in dramatic contrast to the hysterical paroxysms that preceded it The conditions favorable to thought coincide with the death of the surrogate victim Mens minds turn back to the miracle in order to perpetuate or renew it and in order to accomplish this they need to reflect upon that miracle to rethink it Myths rituals and kinship systems are the first fruits of this endeavor To refer to the origin of symbolic thought is to speak as well of the origin of language If the mechanism of the surrogate victim gives birth to language and imposes itself as the first object of language it is easy to see why language should first state the conjunction of best and worst the divine epiphany the rite that commemorates this epiphany 7 Ibid p 51 23 6 Violence and the Sacred and the myth that recalls it For a long time language remains imbued with the sacred thus there is good reason why it should long appear as a vassal of the sacred obedient to its every command Cultural significations naturally include an arbitrary element for they establish differences where formerly the symmetry of the doubles prevailed and substitute the stability of fixed meanings for the vertiginous alternation of violent reciprocity For example they relegate plague to one category and patricide and incest to another The machinery of discrimination plays us false as long as it applies itself to those whom nothing distinguishes Indeed it must play us false in order to work effectively in order to bring about the differentiated unity of the whole community In the midst of a living culture men are incapable of recognizing the arbitrary nature of the significations produced by this mysterious mechanism The processes of discrimination exclusion and conjunction are the products of the generative process They are applied first to this same process and this application gives rise to religious thought But they do not confine themselves to religious thought alone they are the mechanism for all orders of thought And we cannot afford the luxury of rejecting or even denigrating them for the truth is that they do their work well When applied to something other than the original process they bring to light veritable differences analyze real phenomena and encompass data of a nonrelative varietyfor instance the data of human generation It is not correct to say that these data have recently become verifiable under modern laboratory conditions that have transformed them into scientific truths They are scientific truths today because they have always been scientific truths Basic discoveries may result from bricolage In the realm of religion to be sure error prevails But even here we are not dealing with anything imaginary or gratuitous as the modern rationalists arrogantly assume Primitive religion is not given over to the phantoms fantasies and aberrant impulses that modern man thinks he alone has discarded Rather and quite simply religion fails to grasp the mechanism of the surrogate victim just as we still fail to grasp it This perpetuation of the same error is what links our own thought to primitive thought and what paradoxically compels us to regard the latter as very different from our own even though the two modes of thought are very similar This condescending attitude toward the primitive is nothing more than an extension of a primitive attitude that is an indefinite prolongation of misunderstanding of the role of the surrogate victim The generative process plays a major role in primitive culture but passes unnoticed in ours This fact has dictated enormous changes in LeviStrauss Structuralism and Marriage Laws 257 many aspects of our life and in our range of knowledge but it alters nothing in regard to the basic misapprehension that continues to govern us and to shield us from our own violence and from awareness of this violence It is this chronic primitivism that prompts us to dismiss as mere illusion anything that draws our attention to the true state of things and it is this same primitivism that prevents us from recognizing that falsehood in religious thought is something quite different from mere error that falsehood has protected mankind from selfdestruction iMen may be even more dependent on the surrogate victim than we have indicated It is the surrogate victim who provides men with the will to conquer reality and the weapons for all victorious intellectual campaignshaving first secured society against violence The myths of symbolic thought can be compared to a larvas cocoon without this shelter no development could take place To explain the preponderance of the arbitrary in primitive culture we must understand that these societies are closer to the generative act of arbitration than we are and we must realize that this proximity informs every aspect of their historical reality We can envision this original arbitrary7 act as overflowing its limits and engendering a superabundance of differences historical societies may well offer a weakened image of this process when after a period of chaos and turmoil they do a volteface and adopt a rigid hierarchic and highly compartmentalized mode of existence Without making too much of the analogy I might say that certain highly subdivided cultures confined to the languages of ritual and kinship are closer both temporally and temperamentally to the original impact of the generative violence than are the more mobile and flexible societies whose systems of social structure are less in evidence The omnipresent and inflexible difference may well assure stability but it will certainly discourage intellectual speculation especially speculation regarding the origins of culture In order for men to make discoveries about their own culture codified rituals must give way to an agile mode of thinking that uses the same mechanisms as religion with a virtuosity that religion never approached The cultural order itself must have begun to disintegrate and the overflow of differences must have subsidednot so much however as to provoke a new outbreak of violence which would in turn generate new differences For reasons unknown to us primitive societies never meet these conditions When the cycle of violence begins it also comes to an end with such rapidity that the opportunity for making major selfdiscoveries hardly exists Modern Western society however can be described in terms of an 238 Violence and the Sacred exceptionally farranging and drawnout critical cycle The very essence of modern society might be said to be its ability to sustain the possibility for new discoveries in the midst of an everworsening sacrificial crisisnot to be sure without many signs of anxiety and stress There is room for discovery in the natural sciences in the field of cultural significations and finally on the specific subject of the arbitrary generative act The extreme poverty of our kinship system in comparison with those of primitive societies seems a sign of crisis in itself The Western world is in a perpetual state of crisis and the crisis is alwfays spreading As its ethnological basis falls away its specific nonspecificity becomes more pronounced The Western world has always had a penchant for anthropology And that penchant becomes more urgent as the situation around us worsens The present crisis affects all aspects of scholarship its polemical characteristics as well as its rate of progress Our anthropological vocation stems from the general nature of Western society and increases in intensity to keep step with the crisis just so Oedipus investigation kept pace with the accelerating rhythm of the tragic crisis The crisis could determine as well the overall pattern of our researches and successive discoveries and the order in which the theoretical premises keep changing All scholarly priorities are historically determined whether or not research in the strict sense is involved Like all cultures our culture wears away from the periphery toward the center The newly emerging social sciences exploit this deterioration in a rational systematic fashion The debris of the process serves as the object of objective knowledge thus the positive regulations of kinship as opposed to the prohibitions and more generally its systems of expression become in structural ethnology the object of positive knowledge The essential characteristic of structuralism is that it puts the emphasis on positive regulations If the prohibition and the regulation constitute two opposite poles of the same object there is good reason to inquire which is the essential one LeviStrauss poses this very question and resolves it in favor of the regulation Exogamy has a value less negative than positive    It asserts the social value of other people and    it prohibits endogamous marriage only in order to introduce and to prescribe marriage with a group other than the biological family certainly not because a biological danger is attached to consanguineous marriage but because exogamous marriage results in social benefit8 8 LeviStrauss The Elementary Structures of Kinship p 480 LeviStrauss Structuralism and Marriage Laws 239 We could easily cite fifteen or twenty such declarations all perfectly explicit which prove that LeviStrausss work far from displaying a passion for incest is remarkable for its dispassionate approach They do not conceive of the prohibition as such ie in its negative aspect the prohibition is merely the reverse or counterpart of a positive obligation which alone is present and active in the consciousness    Marriage prohibitions    are prohibitions only secondarily and derivatively Rather than a prohibition on a certain category of persons they are a prescription directed towards another category In this regard how much more penetrating is native theory than are so many modern commentaries There is nothing in the sister mother or daughter which disqualifies them as such Incest is socially absurd before it is morally culpable The prohibition of incest is less a rule prohibiting marriage with the mother sister or daughter than a rule obliging the mother sister or daughter to be given to others9 I have already broached the problem of priorities and adopted a point of view diametrically opposed to that of LeviStrauss for me prohibitions come first This perspective is necessitated by my overall approach Positive exchanges are merely the reverse of prohibitions the results of a series of maneuvers or avoidance taboos designed to ward off outbreaks of rivalry among the males Terrified by the fearful consequences of endogamous reciprocity men have created the beneficial reciprocity of exogamic exchange It is only natural that in a smoothly functioning system positive regulations should move to the forefront as the awareness of danger grows dim At the outset however the matrimonial rules are like those perfectly choreographed gestures unwittingly executed by characters in classic comedy and inspired by sentiments wholly foreign to the dance such as jealousy or fear LeviStrauss is undoubtedly correct to minimize the fascination for incest as such insofar as it is a cultural phenomenon it constituted a manifestation of the sacrificial crisis But this does not mean that prohibitions do not come first If they did not it would be virtually impossible to situate our own society within the universal ethnological pattern If rules are to be considered the cornerstone of a society then we are faced with something of a problem in regard to our own society which is deficient in positive regulations and has in fact discarded everything except the basic exogamic prohibition The structuralists hasten to assure us that there is nothing unique about our society Yet in placing their emphasis on regulations they make it appear very unique indeed Any attempt to minimize the singularity of our society 9 Ibid pp 485 481 240 Violence and the Sacred only serves by a process of selfdenigration that still has its roots in religion to raise it to the top once more If we wish to situate ourselves in relation to other cultures we must refine the current view of our ethnocentrism and resign ourselves to the relative uniqueness of our society Contemporary thought is in chaos as it must be when progress is real Where it still survives it displays pathological symptoms Thought in fact is caught up in a circle the very circle drawn for us br Euripidean tragedy In striving to escape from the circle thought only enters more deeply into it and as the radius of the circle shrinks thought moves ever faster spinning itself into an obsession However there is no such thing as an obsession pure and simple as the legion of timorous antiintellectuals would have us believe and it is not by breaking out of the circle that thought will ultimately free itself but by penetrating to its very center while somehow managing to avoid the pitfall of madness Nothing now exists to interfere with a full revelation of violence not even violence itself which men and its own extraordinary growth have combined to deprive of that freedom of moment that formerly assured the efficiency of the generative mechanism and the repression of the truth The trap that the Western Oedipus has set for himself will snap closed at the precise moment when the quest is finished for trap and quest here again are one and the same thing Today the reign of violence is made manifest It assumes the awesome and horrific form of technological weaponry These weapons as the experts blandly inform us are what is keeping the whole world more or less in line The idea of limitless violence long scorned by sophisticated Westerners suddenly looms up before us Absolute vengeance formerly the prerogative of the gods now returns precisely weighed and calibrated on the wings of science And it is this force we are told that prevents the first planetary society the society that already encompasses or will soon encompass the whole of humanity from destroying itself It seems increasingly clear that the pressure of violence or the insistence of truth for whom man acts as a kind of torchbearer has forced modern man to come face to face with this same violence or truth For the first time he is confronted with a perfectly straightforward and even scientifically calculable choice between total destruction and the total renunciation of violence It is something more than mere chance that has led to the coincidence of these remarkable events linking the indubitably real progress of the socalled human sciences with the slow but steady progress of LeviStrauss Structuralism and Marriage Laws 241 knowledge toward an understanding of the surrogate victim and of the violent origins of all human culture 4 ETHNOLOGICAL STRUCTURALISM works at uncovering differences everywhere Superficially it might be said to be the simple antithesis of an older ethnological approach that of LevyBruhl which refused to see differences anywhere LevyBruhl thought that he had located the primitive mind in certain aspects of myth and religion and he postulated a permanent inability on the part of primitive peoples the Australian aborigines for example to discern differences He went so far as to suggest that these aborigines could hardly distinguish between men and kangaroos The structuralists have replied that as far as kangaroos are concerned the aborigines have a thing or two to teach the ethnologists It sometimes seems as if the variations of twentieth century7 ethnology run parallel to the variations in esthetics and to intellectual fads in general LevyBruhls primitive man lost in the mists of his mythic stupor is succeeded by the structuralist chess player elaborating intricate systems with imperturbable ease We are constantly shuttling between these extremes which serve to create an illusion of change by means of increasingly bizarre constructs but which in reality change very little LevyBruhl and the structuralists cannot be put on the same level because differentiated structures have a definite autonomy a textual reality that the sacred never possesses or possesses only in appearance Structural analysis cannot deal with everything but within its limits it is highly satisfactory The sacred concerns itself above all with the destruction of differences and this nondifference cannot appear as such in the structure It can only appear as we saw in Chapter 2 in the guise of a new and somewhat equivocal kind of differencea double multiple monstrous fantastic difference but one that is nonetheless meaningful In Mythologiques monsters are ranked alongside tapirs and peccaries as if they constituted real zoological species And in a sense they do For in myths the role of violence in destroying and producing significations is muted and disguised and those aspects of the myth that refer to its own origins are woven into a tissue of enigmatic allusions Structuralism cannot penetrate this enigma because it deals only with differential systems because strictly speaking only differential systems are directly observable As long as meaning is healthy the sacred is absent It remains outside the structure untouched by structural ethnology banished by struc242 Violence and the Sacred turalism In a sense this elimination of the sacred constitutes real progress for it is finally accomplished in a thorough and systematic manner And though accompanied by ideological prejudices it is not dependent on them for its efficacy Structuralism constitutes a negative but indispensable stage in the discovery of the sacred for it does away with the confusion that has previously prevailed Thanks to structuralism it is possible to distinguish the finite quality of senseof structure from the infinite quality of the sacred that inexhaustible reservoir from which all differences flow and into which they all converge We now know that the sacred reigns supreme wherever a cultural order has not yet taken hold has only begun to take hold or has lost its hold entirely The sacred also reigns over structure engenders organizes observes and perpetuates it or on the contrary mishandles dissolves transforms and on a whim destroys it But the sacred is not actually present in structure in the sense that it is present everywhere else Structuralism makes this relationship clear but it is incapable of expressing it directly for structuralism is itself locked into the structure a prisoner of the synchronic unable to perceive a change in terms of violence or fear of violence Structuralism has its limits and it is precisely these limits that make the disappearance of the sacred seem natural to the structuralists Yet they can no more reply to the question Where did the sacred disappear than they can reply to the accusation of overemphasizing binary oppositions Their proper reply to this latter charge should be that binary oppositions are predominant because there are never more than two antagonists or two sides in any conflict and as soon as a third adversary7 appears the two others either join forces in opposing him or he elects to join one or the other side To pass beyond the limits of structuralism we must first pause to consider the doubtful significations those that imply both too little and too much twins illnesses all forms of contaminations and contagions inexplicable reversals of meaning unexpected growths and shrinkages strange excrescences and deformations and all forms of the monstrous and the bizarre Nor of course should we overlook sexual and other transgressions acts of violence or behavior that is in any way exceptional especially when such behavior seems to be in defiance of an explicit gesture of communal unanimity The opening pages of LeviStrausss The Raiv and the Cooked seem to abound in signs relating to mythic birth incest vengeance betrayal by either a brother or brotherinlaw collective metamorphoses or destructions as preambles to acts of foundation and creationand all of them attributed to culture heroes whose antagonisms have somehow been aroused LeviStrauss Structuralism and Marriage Laws 243 In a Bororo myth the sun commands the inhabitants of a village to cross a river by means of a footbridge which collapses under their combined weight All the villagers perish with the exception of the culture hero who could only walk slowly because his legs were deformed and therefore lagged behind the rest10 The hero brings the drowned villagers back to life under different forms The hair of those who were sucked into the whirlpools turned wavy or curly the hair of those who drowned in calm waters was fine and smooth11 They return in separate groups and on a selective basis In a Tenetehara myth the culture hero Tupan is furious at learning that his godchild had been mistreated by the relatives in whose care he had placed the boy and he orders the child to gather all the feathers he could find and to spread them around the edge of the village Then Tupan set fire to the feathers and the entire village was surrounded by walls of flame The inhabitants ran from side to side but they were unable to escape Little by little their cries became lower until they were transformed into the grunts of pigs at the same time the people began to take on the form of peccaries and wild pigs A few of them escaped into the dense forest and the wild pigs that inhabit the forest today are their descendants Tupan made his godchild Marana ywa the owner of the wild pigs12 In an interesting variant the culture hero puffed clouds of tobacco smoke into the interior The occupants became dizzy and when the demiurge cried out to them Eat your food they thought he was ordering them to copulate They proceeded to have coitus and made the usual grunting sounds while doing so They were all changed into wild pigs13 This passage offers a clear indication of the mystical role played by tobacco and drugs in chamanistic and other practices Tobacco contributes to the sense of dizziness induced by the sacrificial crisis The reciprocal violence expressed by the inhabitants running from side to side in the first version is reinforced by the sexual promiscuity in the second the result of an explitit loss of significations Although LeviStrauss if not referring specifically to a sacrificial crisis he is clearly referring to the birth if not the rebirth of significations It is clear that the myths I am comparing all offer an original solution to the problem of the changeover from continuous quantity to discrete quantity14 Thus we are indeed dealing with significancei

tragedy has been primarily employed to decipher the myths of which the tragedies themselves constitute the first efforts at decipherment In concluding the present chapter I will try to show that this method loses none of its validity when applied outside the realm of Greek tragedy and mythology Because the last two chapters have been largely devoted to incest prohibitions and marriage regulations it might be interesting to examine a myth that attributes the same origin to both of them and lends support to our theory as a whole The myth in question comes from the Tsimshian Indians who inhabit the Pacific coast of Canada15 A chieftains son falls in love with the daughter of his mothers brotherthat is his crosscousin The girl out of sheer perversity demands that the young man prove his love by disfiguring himself The young man therefore scars first his left cheek then his right and the girl horrified by his ugliness banishes him from her sight The brokenhearted young man flees the country intent only on death Finally he arrives in the land of Chief Pestilence Master of Deformities A crowd of tribesmen surround their leader all of them mutilated and crippled They are dangerous for anyone who responds to their advances comes to resemble them The young man is careful to ignore them and the chief agrees to restore his features in fact to make him handsomer than before The young man is boiled in a magic pot from which the chiefs daughter extracts his stripped and whitened bones He is then brought back to life resplendent with beauty Now it is the girls turn to fall in love with her cousin and her cousins turn to demand the same proof of love she had asked of him 13 Franz Boas Tsimshian Mythology Report of the Bureau of American Ethnology 31 185 No 25 See also Stith Thompson ed Tales of the North American Indians Bloomington Ind 1968 pp 178186 LeviStrauss Structuralism and iVlarriage Laws 245 The girl scars both sides of her face and is scornfully rejected by the young man Frantic to have her lost beauty restored she too repairs to the court of Chief Pestilence but unlike the young man she accepts the tribesmens invitation to join them Thereupon they make the unfortunate young woman one of their own crippling and mutilating her and then casting her out to die The reader will have recognized in this tale a number of familiar themes All the people in the myth either disfigure others demand that others disfigure themselves try in vain to disfigure others or actually disfigure themselvesall of which amounts ultimately to the same thing One cannot exert violence without submitting to it that is the law of reciprocity Everybody in the myth comes to resemble everybody else The danger threatening newcomers at the hands of Chief Pestilences tribesmen is in fact visited by both cousins on each other Pestilence and mutilation signify one and the same reality the sacrificial crisis In the relationship between the two cousins the woman initially has the upper hand She incarnates beauty the man ugliness she is free of desire while he is caught in its thrall The relationship is then reversed Differences cancel each other out a symmetry is constantly generated invisible in each synchronic moment taken separately but visible in the accumulation of successive moments This is what constitutes the nondifference of the sacrificial crisis a truth forever inaccessible to the two partners who live out the relationship in the form of alternating differences The symmetry of the overall picture is reflected in the two sides of the face each scarred in turn The same details are reiterated throughout the story until the conclusion but never simultaneously Between the two cousins and Chief Pestilences tribesmen there is the same relationship as that between the protagonists of Oedipus the King and the Theban plague victims The only way to avoid contagion is to turn a deaf ear to the appeals of the enemy brothers On the level of the tribesmenthat is the collectivitythe myth speaks objectively It does what we ourselves did in our opening chapters it shortcircuits the alternating differences It does so with good reason for this difference only ends in similarity The reciprocal mutilation takes the direct form of a loss of differences a becoming the same at the hands of those whom violence has already made identical When we note that this process consists of turning men into doubles as well as into monsters it is clear that we are dealing here with a sacrificial crisis Mutilation symbolizes the working of the crisis in dramatic fashion Clearly it must be viewed both as the creation of fearfully deformed beings and as the elimination of all distinguishing characteristics all the 246 Violence and the Sacred salient features of these beings The process imposes uniformity and eliminates differences but it never succeeds in establishing harmony In the image of monstrous mutilation the procedures of reciprocal violence are expressed in such powerfully condensed form that they appear bizarre indecipherable and mythic LeviStrauss mentions this Tsimshian myth in one of his essays he calls it a horrific little fiction16 We prefer to describe it as a remarkable fiction about the horrific human relationships occasioned by reciprocal violence In any case the term fiction is hardly worth retaining Although the myth itself is foreign to our Western mode of thought the relationship between the cousins introduces an element that our classic theater traditionally treats in terms of tragic conflict or comic misunderstanding and that also bears a striking resemblance to the sentiment of lovejealousy found in the novels of Stendhal Proust and Dostoevsky The prince and princess claim and obtain from each other the same violent loss of difference that Chief Pestilences tribesmen inflict on those who are mad enough to join their ranks All differences dissolve and disappear yet in a sense they remain inviolate and whole We are never told in the myth that the differences between the tribesmen and the two cousins and more importantly between the two cousins themselves have been eliminated and the destruction of the symmetry between the cousins at the conclusion forcefully affirms the primacy of differences There is nothing in the relationship between the cousins to justify this loss of symmetry except for the fact that the Indian girl like Oedipus initiated the whole action This identifying of the origin with an instance of impure violence is not wholly satisfactory Once again we find ourselves confronted by the basic contradiction that underlies Oedipus the King and The Bacchae While the course of the relationships reveal a constant erosion of all the differences and while the mythic action tends toward the perfect symmetry of the undifferentiated relationships the outcome of the myth arbitrarily reverses the process The asymmetry of the message is here again in direct contrast to the burgeoning symmetry apparent on every other level Everything leads us to suspect that this contradiction must be linked to a specific event that lies buried in the myths conclusionthe murder of the girl who to all appearances performs the role of surrogate victim Once again the unanimityminusone of collective violence recreates mythic differences which are themselves the issues of a violent undifferentiation taking place throughout the narrative 16 Claude LeviStrauss La Geste dAsdiwal Annuaire de Vecole pratique des bautes etudes 6 19559 LeviStrauss Structuralism and Marriage Laws 241 The violence to which the young woman is subjected at the hands of Chief Pestilences tribesmen resembles the violence that preceded it in every way but one its finality The act serves definitively to stabilize a difference that otherwise would have continued to alternate between the two protagonists It is the whole mob of tribesmen the whole community which falls upon the girl and tears her limb for limb with their naked hands Once again we recognize a Dionysiac sparagmos And once again we recognize the generative because unanimous act of mob murder The return to differentiated harmony is based on the arbitrary expulsion of the surrogate victim The metamorphosis of the chieftains son is also based on this generative violence even though it happens to precede it in the mythic sequence and is integrated in part to the reciprocal interplay It is the other face of the generative violence the return to beneficence following the paroxysm of malevolence That is why this metamorphosis also abounds in elements that designate and disguise the mechanism of the surrogate victim The strange technique of the happy metamorphosis resembles a shamanistic initiatory dream of which there are many examples in American Indian folklore dreams about dead men who are revived when their body or bones have been trampled on17 This technique can perhaps be compared to a sacrificial practice referred to earlier see p 100 in which the crowd stamps on the victim himself or on his burial place It should also be noted however that the final metamorphosis occurs with stripped and whitened bonesthat is with human remains that are free from all taint of corruption or decay The metamorphosis of the chieftains son thus constitutes a return from the dead It is the happy result of an act of supreme violence perpetrated by restored unanimity The reconquest of beauty coincides with the renovation of the cultural order And Chief Pestilence himself incarnates all the successive aspects of violence master of deformities and metamorphoses sole arbiter of the ultimate game he plays the same role as Dionysus in The Bacchae AH the significant differentiations of the myththe difference between the protagonists and Chief Pestilences tribesmen then the sexual difference between the protagonists together with the fact that they are crosscousinsall these can be traced back to the act of generative violence The mythic action the process of violent undifferentiation cannot fail to upset the norm established at the myths outset the difference which is now normative as well as significant enjoining these two crosscousins of different sex to marry An unstable combination of undifferentiation and difference the myth is inevitably pre17 Cf Thompson ed Tales of the North American Indians Bloomington 1968 p 261 n I 248 Violence and the Sacred sented in terms of the violation of a rule established by itself This is the way it was originally told to Franz Boas by his native informant Ever since the girl in the myth met her unhappy fate he was told young girls have been married off to their cousins regardless of their personal preferences It is interesting to compare our myth with the rites performed at the marriage of crosscousins of a princely family of the Tsimshian people When the prince and the princess have been joined together the tribesmen of the young mans uncle begin to shake then the tribesmen of the girls uncle begin to shake and a combat breaks out between the two groups Stones are thrown and many heads are battered The scars and wounds serve as proof of the wedding contract18 Up to this point the presence of the sacrificial crisis behind the myth was only a hypothesis prompted by the belief that the mutilation image was based on a real occurrence The matrimonial myth confirms this hypothesis by incorporating the violence in question ritual violence to be sure but perfectly real and clearly linked to the theme of mutilation in the myth Stones are thrown and man heads battered It is easy to imagine a twentiethcentury Cervantes or Moliere planting in the midst of those flying stones a devotee of the selfreferential text in order to prove to him that some metaphors are more striking than others The Indians had no doubts on this subject The scars and wounds    serve as proof of the wedding contract The sacrificial nature of this violence is further confirmed bv an additional fact communicated to Boas by another native informant Among the Niquas whose marriage customs are similar to those of the Tsimshians the battle betwen the two groups can reach such a pitch of intensity that one of the slaves on the fiances side is killed The sacrificial aspect of this action is implicit but obvious It is known in advance to what side the victim will belong and that he will be a slave and not a free manthat is somebody wholly apart from the community whose death will not risk unleashing a real crisis Although foreseen the death retains a problematical quality that recalls the unforeseeable advent of the surrogate victim for a man is not killed on every such occasion When a man is killed his death is looked upon as a good omen a sign that the couple will never separate The diverse mutilations described in the Tsimshian myth and ritual will undoubtedly prompt the psychoanalytically inclined to see the whole affair in terms of castration The loss of difference is a more comprehensive interpretation The theme of violent undifferentdation 18 Boas Tsimshian Mythology LeviStrauss Structuralism and Marriage Laws 249 includes that of castration whereas the castration theme cannot possibly include all the elements covered by violent undifferentiation Ritual violence is intended to reproduce an original act of violence There is nothing mythic about this original violence but its ritual imitation necessarily includes mythic elements The original violence certainly did not bring into conflict two such neatly differentiated groups as those of the two uncles It can be stated as a principle that violence precedes either the division of an original group into twTo exogamous moieties or the association of two groups of strangers gathered together to effect matrimonial exchanges The original violence took place within a single solitary group which the mechanism of the surrogate victim compelled either to split in separate groups or to seek an association with other groups Ritual violence invariably takes place between already constituted groups Ritual violence is always less internal than the original violence In assuming a mythicoritual character violence tends toward the exterior and this tendency in turn assumes certain sacrificial characteristics it conceals the site of the original violence thereby shielding from this violence and from the very knowledge of this violence the elementary group whose very survival depends on the absolute triumph of peace The ritual violence that accompanies the exchange of women serves a sacrificial purpose for each group In sum the groups agree never to be completely at peace so that their members may find it easier to be at peace among themselves We see here the principle behind all foreign wars aggressive tendencies that are potentially fatal to the cohesion of the group are redirected from within the community to outside it Inversely there is reason to believe that the wars described as foreign wars in the mythic narratives were in fact formerly civil strifes There are many tales that tell of two warring cities or nations in principle independent of one anotherThebes and Argos Rome and Alba Hellas and Troywhose conflicts bring to the surface so many elements pertaining directly to the sacrificial crisis and to its violent resolution that it is hard not to view these stories as mythic elaborations of this same crisis presented in terms of a Active foreign threat l Chapter Ten The Gods the Dead the Sacred and Sacrificial Substitution e   3  l  EVERY GOD HERO AND MYTHIC CREATURE      so far encountered from the sacred African king to Chief Pestilence of the Tsimshians embodies the interplay of violence projected by an act of generative unanimity Oedipus our first example seemed at the outset of his career to incarnate an almost exclusively maleficent form of violence It was only later in Oedipus at Colonus that he assumed an actively beneficent role As we know unanimous violence is generative of a religious order and the man charged with the crime of patricide and incest is credited with the act of generation Thus Oedipuss transformation into an object of public reverence is not hard to understand The two Oedipus tragedies permit us to study in isolation two conflicting and successive moments of the heros sacralization In The Bacchae as we have observed these same two moments serve to define the dual personality of Dionysus his beneficent and maleficent aspects In the Euripidean drama the moments are so telescoped and juxtaposed that it would be almost impossible to recognize their point of origin or appreciate their historical development if we did not have Sophocles Oedipus plays to guide us The religious formulation of the Oedipus myth is considerably easier to grasp because it is less transmuted more directly based on the mechanism of the surrogate victim In The Bacchae Dionysus plays the role not of victim but of executioner This difference which may at first seem crucial is in fact of no consequence for the religious implications of the work As we have already remarked the mythic or divine creature who appears as the incarnation of violence is not restricted to the role of surrogate victim The metamorphosis of the maleficent into the beneficent is the major aspect of his mission the aspect that elicits public veneration but he is equally capable of effecting the reverse transformation He can intervene at any stage and assume all roles either simultaneously or in succession Thus there are moments in Dionysus career when he 250 Sacrificial Substitution 251 relinquishes the role of executioner to assume that of victim of the diasparagmos In one episode of his myth for instance he is torn limb for limb by a raging mob of Titans a mythic creature Zagreus or Dionysus is sacrificed by other mythic creatures The burden of the story is identical to that of the origin myths referred to earlier We have seen that in the course of the Incwala rites the King of the Swazi becomes simultaneously executioner and victim Similarly the Aztec god XipeTotec demonstrates the ability of the incarnation of the sacred to assume different roles within the system Sometimes this god is killed and flayed in the person of a victim offered as substitute for him at other times the god becomes the executioner flaying victims in order to don their skin Evidently religious thought perceives all those who participate in this violent interplay whether actively or passively as doubles XipeTotec can be translated our flayed lord and mastera name that suggests that the basic role remains that of surrogate victim The theory of a violence that is sometimes reciprocal sometimes unanimous and generative is the first truly to take into account the double nature of all primitive divinities the blending of beneficent and maleficent that characterizes all mythical figures who involve themselves in mortal affairs Dionysus is at one and the same time the most terrible and the most gentle of the gods There is a Zeus who hurls thunderbolts and a Zeus as sweet as honey In fact there is no ancient divinity who does not have a double face If the Roman Janus turns to his worshippers a countenance alternately warlike and peaceful that is because he too reflects the same alternation and if he comes in time to symbolize foreign war that is because foreign war is merely another form of sacrificial violence If we understand the interplay of violence in primitive societies the origins and structure of all mythical and supernatural beings becomes clear As we have seen the surrogate victim meets his death in the guise of the monstrous double All sacred creatures partake of monstrosity whether overtly or covertly this aspect of their nature can be traced to the monstrous double The marriage of beneficent and maleficent constitutes of course the original and fundamental monstrosity the superhuman creatures absorption of the difference between good and bad difference that basic difference that dominates all others There is no essential difference between the monstrous aspects of Oedipus and the monstrous aspects of Dionysus Dionysus is simultaneously god man and bull Oedipus is simultaneously son husband father and brother of the same human beings Both have incorporated into themselves differences normally considered irreconcilable Reli252 Violence and the Sacred gious thinking puts all differences at the same level it assimilates family and cultural differences to natural differences When we are dealing with mythology therefore we must make do without any clear distinction between physical monstrosity and moral monstrosity Religious thought makes no distinction between biological twins and twins of violence engendered by the disintegration of the cultural order All the episodes of the Oedipus myth are repetitions of one another Once we recognize this fact it becomes apparent that all the figures in the various episodes are monsters and that their resemblance is far closer than appearance alone might suggest Oedipus naturally is a monster but Tiresias is a monster too as a hermaphrodite he incorporates the difference between the two sexes The sphinx is a monster a veritable conglomerate of differences with its womans head lions body serpents tail and eagles wings On first glance there is a radical difference between this imaginary creature and the human protagonists but this difference vanishes on closer inspection The sphinxplays the same role in relation to Oedipus as do all the human figures The sphinx bars Oedipuss way it becomes an object of fascination and a secret model it is the bearer of the logos phobon the oracle of doom Like Laius like the drunken Corinthian earlier in the story and Creon and Tiresias later the sphinx dogs Oedipuss trackswhenever that is Oedipus is not dogging the sphinxs tracks Like the others the sphinx catches Oedipus in an oracular trap in short the episode of the sphinx recapitulates the other episodes The sphinx appears as the incarnation of maleficent violence as Oedipus himself will appear later on The sphinx has been sent by Hera to punish Thebes just as the plague is visited upon the city by order of Apollo Like the plague the sphinxs appetite for victims increases steadily until it is vanquished by Oedipus who thereby restores the city The episode of the sphinx shows Oedipus in the role of monsterkiller or executioner Later a monster himself he will assume the role of surrogate victim Like all incarnations of sacred violence Oedipus can and does play every part in succession The sacred king is also a monster He is simultaneously god man and savage beast Royal titles like the Lion or the Leopard may degenerate into mere formulas but they have their origin in memories of the monstrous double and generative unanimity Moral and physical monstrosity are thus blended and confused Like Oedipus the king is at once stranger and son the most intimate of insiders and the most bizarre of outsiders he is an exemplar of enormous tenderness and frightful savagery As an incestuous criminal he stands above and beyond all the rules he promulgates and enforces He is the wisest and the most lunatic the blindest and the most lucid of men This monopSacrificial Substitution 253 olizing of differences which makes of the king a sacred monster in every possible sense of the term finds vivid expression in ritual chants The chieftain is neither this nor that The chieftain is neither good nor bad He is at once guest foreigner and host villager He is the wise man and the fool1 It should be no cause for surprise then that the august inhabitants of Olympus have been charged with a fair number of rapes murders parricides and incestuous acts as well as innumerable incidents of savagery and madness Nor should we be surprised to discover that these divine personages seem to be made up of bits and pieces taken from every order of realityhuman animal inorganic cosmic Nothing is more futile than to seek stable distinctions among these monsters unless it is the attempt to derive psychological insights from their stories insights pertaining either to individuals or to the collective consciousness Of all learned pursuits undertaken in the course of Western history that one is surely the most foolhardy The pseudorational treatment of monsters the classification of monster stories into archetypes can only serve as a humorless revision of Ovids subtle and exhaustive Metamorphoses it can only serve further to elaborate the mythological process To pontificate on the subject of monsters is in effect to take them seriously to enter into their game it is to be duped by their appearance instead of recognizing the human being who lurks behind the monstrous form The variations among various types of mythological creatures only become interesting if we relate these variations to their common origin in generative violence We then realize that the differences reside not in the objects themselves but in the indeterminate nature of the hallucinated differentiation they embody an differentiation that is made determinate retrospectively by the generative violence Some religious differences clearly reflect the violence that engendered them the ritual incest of the African monarchs for instance or such sacrificial practices as the Dionysiac sparagmos In many mythologies the gods spirits or mythic creatures are divided into two distinct camps one of serious and one of comic personalities The Greek Hermes and the Roman Mercury are examples of comic gods Some societies harbor sacred clowns or fools The North Americans have their tricksters1 there are royal fools and kings of fools and any number of temporary sovereigns both comic and tragic who are ceremonially sacrificed at the predetermined end of their brief reign These figures are incarnations of sacred violence as surely as the Afri1 Theuws Naitre et mourir dans le rituel Luba p 172 254 Violence and the Sacred can king but on a somewhat different level In each case we are dealing with collective violence and more specifically with a certain mode of collective violence In addition to the serious expulsion there must always have been an act of expulsion based at least in part on ridicule In the modern world our everyday much diluted forms of social ostracism are generally based on ridicule much of contemporary literature is explicitly or implicitly concerned with this phenomenon We need only think of those social categories and individuals that provide the victims in scapegoat ritesvagabonds beggars cripplesto recognize that derision of one form or another plays a large part in the negative feelings that find expression in the course of the ritual sacrifice and that are finally purified and purged by it We have here a body of material that calls out for detailed analysis But because the relevance of this material to my general thesis presents at least in principle no real problem let us pass on to other forms of religion and consider how they can fit my scheme Let us turn first to a religious practice that may appear very different from those previously examined but one that is in actuality closely related ancestor worship or more simply the worship of the dead In certain cultures the gods are either absent or insignificant In such cases mythic ancestors or the dead take the place of the missing divinities and are seen as the founders guardians and if need be disrupters of the cultural order When incest adultery and other social ills begin to proliferate when family relationships begin to crumble the dead are displeased and visit their displeasure on the living They bring nightmares madness contagious diseases they provoke discord among relatives and neighbors and instigate all sorts of perversions The crisis assumes the form of a loss of difference between the living and the dead a casting down of all barriers between two normally separate realms We have here the proof that the dead incarnate violence exterior and transcendent violence when order reigns immanent violence when things turn bad and maleficent reciprocity walks abroad The dead do not want the total destruction of an order that is after all basically their own After they have brought about a paroxysm of sorts in the community they are willing once more to accept the homage of their descendants they cease to haunt the living and withdraw to their usual retreats If they do not go into exile of their own accord they allow themselves to be led into exile by the communitys ritual observances The difference between the living and the dead is thereby restored This troubling confusion between living and dead is sometimes regarded as the consequence of the crisis and sometimes as its cause The punishments that the dead inflict upon the living are indistinguishable Sacrificial Substitution 255 from the consequences of wrongdoing In a small community hubris spreads rapidly with as we know dire results Thus the vengeance of the dead like the vengeance of the gods is both real and implacable It is in fact violences own revenge on those who wield it In this instance the dead have clearly replaced the gods and the beliefs relating to the dead lead us back to our discussion of Oedipus Dionysus and the rest Yet a question remains How can the dead incarnate violence as authoritatively as do the gods Death is the ultimate violence that can be inflicted on a living being It is therefore the extreme of maleficence With death a contagious sort of violence is let loose on the community and the living must take steps to protect themselves against it So they quarantine death creating a cordon sanitaire all around it Above all they have recourse to funeral rites which like all other rites are dedicated to the purgation and expulsion of maleficent violence Whatever the cause and circumstances of his death the dying man finds himself in a situation similar to that of the surrogate victim visavis the community The grief of the mourner is a curious mixture of terror and hopea mixture conducive to resolutions of good conduct in the future The death of the individual has something of the quality of a tribute levied for the continued existence of the collectivity A human being dies and the solidarity of the survivors is enhanced by his death The surrogate victim dies so that the entire community threatened by the same fate can be reborn in a new or renewed cultural order Having sown the seeds of death the god ancestor or mythic hero then dies himself or selects a victim to die in his stead In so doing he bestows a new life on men Understanding this process we can also understand why death should be regarded as the elder sister not to say the mother and ultimate source of life itself Belief in a union between life and death has long been ascribed to the cycle of the seasons the annual rebirths and deaths in the plant kingdom Such a theory simply involves heaping one myth on top of another it refuses to acknowledge the violence that permeates all human relationships The theme of death and resurrection flourishes in regions where seasonal change is nonexistent or very slight And even wrhere analogies do exist or when the religious imagination has put them to use we are not justified in regarding nature as the source of this belief The periodicity of the seasons serves as a rhythmic accompaniment to the changes that occur in human relationships and have as their pivot the death of a sacrificial victim Death then contains the germ of life There is no life on the communal level that does not originate in death Death can appear as the 256 Violence and the Sacred true godhead the confluence of the most beneficent and most maleficent forms of violence This mav well have been what Heraclitus meant when he declared Dionysus and Hades are the same Surely he is not merely making reference to Dionysus anecdotal link to the Underworld but rather is directing attention to death community harmony and the genesis of the gods A duality of good and bad may be found even in the material aspects of death As long as the process of decomposition takes its course the cadaver is an impure element Like the violent disintegration of a society the physiological decomposition of the corpse leads gradually from a very complex system of differentials to undifferentiated dust The forms of the living revert to formlessness And language itself falters in describing the remains The rotting corpse becomes in the words of Bossuet cet objet qui na de nom dans aucune langue However once the process has been completed and the terrible dynamism of decomposition is over the impure status of the nameless object is generally terminated as well In certain societies the dry and whitened bones of the deceased are thought to possess beneficial properties to be conducive to fertility2 Every death tends to become ritualized after the model of the generative expulsion to make allusion to the underlying mystery of violence In return the generative expulsion may be memorialized in the form of death This is precisely what takes place when the dead exercise functions that are elsewhere the prerogative of the gods All aspects of violence are assimilated to an individual ancestor or to the entire legion of the dead The monstrous character of the original ancestor the fact that he is frequently the incarnation of an animal can be seen as proof that the monstrous double still holds sway at the origin of the cult The worship of the dead like the worship of the gods represents an interpretation of the role of violence in the destiny of a community In fact it is the most transparent of all such interpretations the closest to what actually occurred the first timeexcept of course that it has misconstrued as always the mechanism of recovered unanimity This interpretation states explicitly that the origin of any cultural order involves a human death and that the decisive death is that of a member of the community 4ft4 l B E G A N B Y TRACING the course of violence through those beings who appear to incarnate it mythic heroes sacred kings gods and deified ancestors Those various incarnations enrich 2 See Chapter 9 p 247 Sacrificial Substitution 257 our understanding of the many roles of violence and clarify the function of the surrogate victim and the preeminent importance of violent unanimity These incarnations are invariably illusory in one sense Violence belongs to all men and thus to none in particular All the actors have the same role with the exception of the surrogate victim But anybody can play the part of surrogate victim It is futile to look for the secret of the redemptive process in distinctions between the surrogate victim and the other members of the community The crucial fact is that the choice of the victim is arbitrary The religious interpretations we have considered so far are at fault precisely because they attribute the beneficial results of the sacrifice to the superhuman nature of the victim or of the other participants insofar as any of these appears to incarnate the supreme violence In addition to such personalized interpretations there is an impersonal approach It corresponds to the full range of the term sacred or rather of the Latin sacer which is sometimes translated sacred sometimes accursed for it encompasses the maleficent as well as the beneficent Analogous words can be found in many languages the famous mana of the Melanesians for example or the ivakan of the Sioux and the orenda of the Iroquois In one respect at least the structure of the sacer is the least deceptive the least mythic of all it postulates no single master of ceremonies no intervention by a privileged party even a superhuman one The fact that the sacer can be understood in terms that require no anthropomorphic presence demonstrates that religion should not be defined as animism or anthropomorphism If religion consisted of humanizing the nonhuman or bestowing souls wherever they were felt to be lacking an impersonal apprehension of the sacred would not be possible My effort to group all the subjects considered in this study under a general heading has resulted in the tide Violence and the Sacred This impersonal designation is fundamental to our discussion In Africa as in many other parts of the world there is only a single term to denote the two faces of the sacredthe interplay of order and disorder of difference lost and retrieved as enacted in the immutable drama of the sacrifice of the incestuous king This term serves to describe all the royal transgressions all forbidden as well as all permitted sexual practices all forms of violence and brutality unclean things decaying matter monstrosities disputes between relatives and neighbors outbursts of spite envy and jealousy In addition the same term embraces the creative impulse and the urge for order for peace calm and stability All these varied significations appear under the aegis of royalty 258 Violence and the Sacred Royalty is an incarnation of the sacred But these same manifestations of the sacred can also exist apart from royalty we must have recourse to the sacred in order to understand the institution of royalty but the reverse does not hold true Sacrifice too can be defined solely in terms of the sacred without reference to any particular divinity that is it can be defined in terms of maleficent violence polarized by the victim and metamorphosed by his death or expulsion from the community which amounts to the same thing into beneficent violence Although the sacred is bad when it is inside the community it is good when it returns to the exterior The language of pure sacredness retains whatever is most fundamental to myth and religion it detaches violence from man to make it a separate impersonal entity a sort of fluid substance that flows everywhere and impregnates on contact The concept of contagion is obviously a byproduct of this way of envisaging the sacred As a concept contagion makes empirical sense in many cases but it is mythic insofar as it ignores the reciprocal aspect of violence it literally reifies the violence mat is active in human relationships by transforming it into a pseudosubstance Though generally less mythic than the language of divinity the language of pure sacredness is more mythic in that it eliminates the final traces of the real victims thereby concealing the fact that the sacred cannot function without surrogate victims I have used the phrase violence and the sacred I might as well have said violence or the sacred For the operations of violence and the sacred are ultimately the same process Although ethnologists are generally disposed to acknowledge that violence exists at the heart of the sacred they also hasten to add that the sacred includes another more important and directly contradictory element The sacred as they see it involves order as well as disorder peace as well as war creation as well as destruction In fact the sacred seems so heterogeneous that the specialists have despaired of ever sorting it out Yet the theory of generative violence permits us to define the sacred in simple concrete terms that emphasize its underlying unity without overlooking its complexity it enables us to bring together all the disparate elements of the sacred into an intelligible whole Once we have recognized the role of generative violence it becomes clear why the sacred is able to include within itself so many opposites Sometimes it rallies the whole community around itself in order to save mankind and restore culture sometimes it seems intent on destroying its own creations Men do not worship violence as such Primitive religion is no cult of violence in the contemporary sense of the phrase Violence is venerated insofar as it offers men what little peace they can ever expect Nonviolence appears as the gratuitous gift of Sacrificial Substitution 259 violence and there is some truth in this equation for men are only capable of reconciling their differences at the expense of a third party The best men can hope for in their quest for nonviolence is the unanimitvminusone of the surrogate victim If primitive religious thought is mistaken in deifying violence it is correct in its refusal to attribute to mankind the principle of social unity To date Western society has escaped the most catastrophic form of basic violence the violence that is capable of annihilating society This privilege however has not been obtained through the kind of depassement advanced by the idealist philosophers who cannot conceive either of the nature of this privilege or the reason behind it and indeed hardly realize their good fortune That is why modern philosophers attribute the origin of society to a social contract either implicit or explicit rooted in reason good sense mutual selfinterest and so forth They are incapable of grasping the essence of religion and attributing to it a real function This incapacity is mythic in character since it perpetuates the religions own misapprehensions in regard to violence It evades the problem of human violence and mistakes the nature of the threat this violence poses for human society Even the crudest of religious viewpoints acknowledges a truth ignored by even the most lucid nonreligious system The religious believer knows that the establishment of a human society is no simple matter and that the credit for its accomplishment cannot go to man The relationship between modem thought and primitive religion is somewhat different from what it appears at first glance Although modern and primitive man share a fundamental misunderstanding of the nature of violence primitive man retains certain insights into this nature insights that are perfectly real and that wholly escape our grasp Religion instructs men as to what they must and must not do to prevent a recurrence of destructive violence When they neglect rites and violate prohibitions they call down upon themselves transcendent violence which assumes the role of the demonic temptoran illusion for which men will continue to fight spiritually as well as physically to the point of total annihilation The surrogate victim alone can save them almighty violence may judge the guilty parties to have been sufficiently punished and may condescend to become its transcendence once more to withdraw far enough away to observe mankind from the exterior of the community yet not so far away that it ceases to inspire the dreadful awe that is essential to mans salvation We the spoiled children of privilege consider the gods anger as something illusory In fact it is a terrible reality Its justice is implacable its impartiality truly divine Anger shows no distinctions in its 260 Violence and the Sacred dealings with men it is at one with reciprocity with the irresistible tendency of violence to turn against the unfortunate beings who have sought to shape it exclusively to their own uses Because of their largescale and sophisticated organization modern Western societies have appeared largely immune to violences law of retribution In consequence modern thinkers assume that this law is and has always been mere illusion and that those modes of thinking that treat it as real are sheer fantasies To be sure these modes of thinking must be considered mythic insofar as they attribute the enforcement of the law to an authority extrinsic to man But the law of retribution itself is very real it has its origins in the reality of human relationships If we are still strangers to this law it is not because we have managed to transcend it but because its application to the modern world has been indefinitely postponed for reasons unknown to us That perhaps is what contemporary history is making clear a3 EACH OF THE PHENOiMENA discussed in this study can be explained by the identity of violence and the sacred This identity explains the dual influence for good and evil of blood in general and menstrual blood in particular it also explains the structure of Greek tragedy and Freuds Totem and Taboo The union of the sacred with violence may seem fanciful or incredible it may jar our habitual way of thinking But the more we look about us the more intelligible this union appears To the examples previously adduced I should like to add one that seems particularly appropriate at this stage of the discussion It can be phrased as a question Why is the production of metal particularly in Africa accompanied by strict regulations and the metal workers themselves endowed with sacred qualities The application of my general theory should yield a ready answer to this small enigma which forms part of the larger enigma of the sacred Metal is the source of inestimable benefits It facilitates domestic tasks and helps the community defend itself against outside enemies But these advantages are not without a reverse side all weapons after all are doubleedged The existence of metal increases the danger that would result from an internal conflict its potentiality for good is balanced by its potentiality for evil The dual tendency of human relationstoward discord and conflict as well as toward cohesion and harmonyis complemented by the nature of metals For better or for worse the metal wrorker is the master of a potent form of violence That is why he is sacred in the dual sense of the word He enjoys certain privileges but is considered a slighdy sinister Sacrificial Substitution 261 figure He is someone to be avoided and his forge is relegated to the outskirts of the community Some modern discussion of this phenomenon conveys the impression at least implicitly that the prestige of the metal worker arises from the natives vague sense that he is somehow infringing on domains reserved for superior civilizationsespecially the most superior civilization of all our very own In this interpretation it is not the dangers inherent in the production of metal or the uses to which men put metal that inspire fear but rather the fact that metalworking is the prerogative of the white man In short the cult of the metal worker would be related directly or indirectly to a single real object ourselves Such a theory bears witness to the monumental fatuousness of a technological culture that has been so dulled by its long and mysterious immunity from attack that it no longer has any consciousness of hubris or even a word to describe that concept Men who have mastered the techniques of metalworking have no reason to regard the process with fear since after all they themselves have mastered it The sacredness of the forge does not emanate from us we have no monopoly on the technique and exert no influence Promethean or otherwise on its practitioners The specters of nuclear warfare and industrial pollution that menace our own society constitute only one illustrationadmittedly a dramatic oneof a law that primitive people regard as real even if thev do not entirely understand it but that we dismiss as fictitious whoever uses violence will in turn be used by it The community that sponsors a forge on its outer boundaries is not very different from our own As long as some profit can be derived from them the metal workers or magicians are left in peace But as soon as the community becomes aware of some backlash of violence it will shift the responsibility to those who led the community into temptation the manipulators of sacred violence They will be accused of having betrayed a community to which they only half belong of having used against this community a power that had ahvays been mistrusted The village may be visited by a calamity that has nothing to do with metal or metal production nevertheless the metal workers life will be in jeopardy In time of trouble he is the one who takes all the blame As soon as the sacredthat is violencehas found its wray to the interior of the community the motif of the surrogate victim will start to emerge The position of the metal worker even in time of peace reveals his connection not only to the magician but also to the sacred king In certain societies the metal worker without ceasing to be a 262 Violence and the Sacred kind of pariah assumes the role of supreme arbiter In the event of an irresolvable struggle he is called upon to differentiate the irreconcilable antagonists thus proving that he incarnates the sacred violence that is sometimes maleficent sometimes beneficent If the metal worker or magician should happen to die at the hands of the community and the communitys hysteria be thereby appeased the intimate connection between the victim and the sacred seems confirmed Like all systems of thought founded on sacrifice the reasoning that endows the metal worker with sacred qualities forms a virtually closed system it can never be refuted The violent death of a metal worker a sorcerer a magician and in general of anybody who seems to share a particular affinity with the sacred might be seen as a halfway point between spontaneous collective violence and ritual sacrifice There is a perfect continuity from one to the other To grasp the nature of this ambiguity is to move closer to an understanding of generative violence and ritual sacrifice and the relationship between these two phenomena e THE FAILURE OF MODERN MAN to grasp the nature of religion has served to perpetuate its effects Our lack of belief serves the same function in our society that religion serves in societies more directly exposed to essential violence We persist in disregarding the power of violence in human societies that is why we are reluctant to admit that violence and the sacred are one and the same thing It is important to insist on this identity and the field of lexicography provides ample supporting evidence Many languages most notably Greek contain terms that reveal the nondifference between violence and the sacred And it is easily demonstrable that cultural evolution in general and lexicographers in particular have a tendency to put asunder that which primitive language has joined that it to suppress the scandalous conjunction of violence and the sacred We will take our examples from a work of great stature whose very mistakes carry weight Emile Benvenistes he Vocabulahe des institutions indoeuropeennes The use of the term hieros to qualify instruments of violence and warfare is so regular that scholars sometimes translate the word as strong active excited etc The Greek hieros is related to the Vedic isirah which is generally translated as vital force This is itself a compromise that conceals the conjunction of the most maleficent and most beneficent forces in the nucleus of the term It is the sort of compromise that modern scholars frequently resort to when defining terms that have to do with the sacred Benveniste asserts that hieros has nothing to do with violence and Sacrificial Substitution 263 should always be translated as sacred He makes no mention of the fact that even in French the word sacre retains an ambiguous sense perhaps inherited from the Latin sacer To the linguist the fact that hieros is frequently associated with terms implying violence is of no importance The use of this term seems to him justified not by the word it directly modifies but by the appearance in the text of some god or some specifically religious motif he regards as wholly foreign to the idea of violence In order to eliminate from words relating to the sacred a duality he finds both dubious and inconvenient Benveniste has recourse to two procedures The first as we have just seen is to suppress altogether whichever of the two meanings has been most weakened in the course of the historical evolution of the word In those rare cases where historical evolution has had no effect on the words duality or where two opposite meanings both carry equal weight Benveniste unhesitatingly affirms that we are really dealing with two different terms accidentally grouped together under the same signifier This second procedure is illustrated by Benvenistes treatment of kratos and its derived adjective krateros Kratos is generally translated as divine force Krateros is sometimes used of a god in which case it is translated as divinely strong7 supernaturally powerful and so forth At other times it qualifies things that seem so foreign to our 7iotion of the gods that the lexicographer flatly refuses the Greeks permission to consider them divine When from kratos we turn to krateros we expect the adjective to convey the same sense as the substantive Kratos always denotes a quality pertaining to heroes warriors and leaders it is reasonable to assume that the adjective krateros has a eulogistic connotation and such is indeed the case However this makes it all the more surprising to encounter krateros being used to describe qualities which are very far from praiseworthy and which incur blame or reproach When Hecuba Priams wife calls the Achilles who has just killed her son Hector an oner krateros Iliad XXlVr 212 she clearly intends no compliment on his martial virtue Paul Mazon translates the phrase as brutal hero And to appreciate the application of the adjective to Ares II 515 we must consider it in the context of some of the gods other epithets imaiphonos homicide andropkones killer of men brotoloigos fatal to mortals aidelos destroyer   none of which present him in a favorable light The discrepancy goes even deeper Whereas kratos applies exclusively to gods and men krateros can refer to animals and objects and its sense in those cases is always hard cruel violent    In Hesiod who uses some of the same vocabulary we find the two meanings we have ascribed to the Homeric krateros favorable when it accompanies the word anunon without reproach Theog 1013 un264 Violence and the Sacred favorable when it describes Ares the killer of men Scutum 92 101 or a dragon Theo 328 or the Erinyes    The basis for the semantic partitioning of the word is its eulogistic connotation the fact that it sheds favorable light the fact of its beneficence Benveniste does not entertain the notion of a union of the beneficent and maleficent within the context of sacred violence Krateros can apply equally to a savage beast tearing apart its prey and to the iron blade of a sword to the hardness of a breastplate to terrible illnesses to the most barbarous acts to strife and to vehement conflicts Were we to quote every example offered by Benveniste virtually all the elements of the sacrificial crisis would pass in parade before our eyes Thus we are dealing with a term that admirably displays the conjunction of good and bad violence within the sacred Because the two meanings of the word are too widely distributed for either of them to be suppressed Benveniste concludes that the lexicographical grouping around kratos reveals a very unusual semantic situation This grouping he asserts is a unity in appearance only in reality the two conflicting meanings should be attached to two IndoEuropean roots of distinctly different origins though related if not actually similar in form4 The sole basis for this theory is a refusal to admit the union of violence and the divine that is made manifest by the various usages of krateros The good krateros of gods and heroes is the same as the bad krateros of monsters plagues and savage beasts An example cited by Benveniste himselfAres kraterosshows the futility of his division Here Benveniste asserts is an instance of the bad krateros That may be but Ares is no less divine for being cruel and brutal And Ares is the god of war It may be that the deification of war is a far more significant matter than the bombastic odes dedicated to the military glory of an Augustus or a Louis XIV might suggest In the rationalists dictionary the sacred is defined either as a concept that is still lacking in specificity or as a fully developed concept that has become confused with other concepts The lexicographer takes it upon himself to make a clean sweep of all ambiguities confusions and uncertainties and to replace them with a perfectly coherent set of significations In fact this tendency is not confined to lexicography alone As we have seen religious interpretations of the sacrificial crisis have always been inclined to categorize its accompanying phenomena as either good or bad The farther one progresses the more pronounced becomes the tendency to make separate and distinct entities 3Emile Benveniste La Vocabulaire des institutions i2doeuropeernesy 2 vols Paris 1969 27S79 4 Ibid p 80 Sacrificial Substitution 265 of the two aspects of the sacred In Latin for example sacer has retained its original double connotation but the need to isolate the beneficent aspects of the word has resulted in an oflfshoot sanctiis So it is that modern lexicography is caught up in the continuing mythological evolution that is little by little effacing the last signs of the generative experience and making the true role of violence ever more difficult to ascertain Some however have resisted this impulse Here for example is Henri Jeanmaires remarkable commentary on the word thysias which signifies a priestess of Bacchus or one of the bacchantes The word is derived from the verb thyiein which we discussed earlier on in connection with another derivative thymos The probable etymology of the word suggests that it is connected to a verb whose sense remains somewhat ambiguous it signifies to make a sacrifice on the one hand and on the other to hurl oneself impetuously or to whirl around like something caught up in a tempest or to swirl about like the waters of a river or sea or bubble up like spilled blood like anger like mad rage There is no need to split these two sets of usages as is sometimes done today no need to divide them into two signifiers with different roots especially if we are willing to agree that this tempestuous whirling motion corresponds to one of the methods by which a bacchante attains her characteristic state of trance and that a sacrifice a sparagmos or otherwise is the normal accompaniment of this sort of state or even that certain archaic forms of sacrifice provided the occasion for ecstatic exercises In addition some modern observers have remarked that the death throes of the sacrificial victim and the convulsive gestures of the possessed person are both seen as manifestations of divine intervention and that the analogy between them is appreciated and explicitly expressed5  Q A 3  THE FORMAL IDENTIFICATION of violence with the sacred as brought about by the mechanism of the surrogate victim will now permit us to complete that theory of sacrifice whose basic tenets were set forth in the earlier chapters of this study I have already rejected the traditional interpretation of sacrifice as an offering made to the gods often in the form of food that provides nourishment for the transcendent being This traditional interpretation is certainly mythic but should not for that reason be regarded as simply imaginary It is worth noting that religious discourse is closer to the truth on this point than all the theories that modern scholars have sought to put in its place Polarized by the sacrificial killing violence is appeased It subsides 5Jeanmaire Dionysos p 158 266 Violence and the Sacred We might say that it is expelled from the community and becomes part of the divine substance from which it is completely indistinguishable for each successive sacrifice evokes in diminishing degree the immense calm produced by the act of generative unanimity by the initial appearance of the god Just as the human body is a machine for transforming food into flesh and blood generative unanimity is a process for changing bad violence into stability and fecundity On the other hand by the very fact of its occurrence this unanimity has set up a mechanism that will repeat its operation indefinitely in the attenuated form of ritual sacrifice If the god is nothing more nor less than the massive violence that was expelled by the original act of generative unanimity then ritual sacrifice can indeed be said to offer him portions of his own substance Every time the sacrifice accompanies its desired effect and bad violence is converted into good stability the god is said to have accepted the offering of violence and consumed it It is not surprising then that all theological systems place sacrificial operations under the jurisdiction of the divinity Successful sacrifice prevents violence from reverting to a state of immanence and reciprocity that is it reinforces the status of violence as an exterior influence transcendent and beneficent Sacrifice accords the god all that he needs to assure his continued growth and vigor And it is the god himself who digests the bad immanence transforming it into good transcendence that is into his own substance The alimentary metaphor is confirmed by the fact that in most cases the sacrificial victim is an animal that man uses for food Behind this metaphor it is easy to discern violence at work and to catch a glimpse of its metamorphoses Although religious explanations of sacrifice are wholly false from the viewpoint of strict scientific truth they are perfectly true from the only viewpoint of any interest to religionthat of protecting human beings from violence For if we neglect to feed the god he will waste away or else maddened by hunger he will descend among men and lay claim to his nourishment with unexampled cruelty and ferocity The surrogate victim is generally destroyed and always expelled from the community As the violence subsides it is thought to have departed with the victim to have somehow been projected outside the community The community itself is felt to be free of infectionso long that is as the cultural order within it is respected Once the outer limits of the community have been crossed we enter the domain of savage sacredness which recognizes neither boundaries nor limits This is the realm not only of gods and supernatural creatures of monsters and the dead but also of nature itself insofar as it Sacrificial Substitution 261 remains untouched by culture of the cosmos and of all the rest of humanity We are wont to say that primitive peoples are imbued with the sacred The truth is that these peoples assume just as we ourselves do that they have freed themselves up to a point from subjection to the sacred They alone adhere to the rules promulgated by the sacred itself that allow them to maintain a precarious independence from divine intervention Foreigners are considered something less and more than human because they fail to follow these rules They may appear very maleficent or very beneficent but in either case they are deeply imbued with the sacred Each community sees itself as a lonely vessel adrift in a fast ocean whose seas are sometimes calm and friendly sometimes rough and menacing The first requirement for staying afloat is to obey the rules of navigation dictated by the ocean itself But the most diligent attention to these rules is no guarantee of permanent safety The ship is far from watertight ceaselessly insidiously it takes in water Only a constant repetition of rites seems to keep it from sinking If it is true that the community has everything to fear from the sacred it is equally true that the community owes its every existence to the sacred For in perceiving itself as uniquely situated outside the sphere of the sacred the community assumes that it has been engendered by it the act of generative violence that created the community is attributed not to men but to the sacred itself Having brought the community into existence the sacred brings about its own expulsion and withdraws from the scene thereby releasing the community from its direct contact The more men reflect on the apparent supremacy of the sacred on the vast disproportion between it and the community the clearer it becomes that the initiative in all domains on all levels belongs to the sacred The birth of the community is first and foremost an act of separation That is why metaphors of severance permeate the generative act For instance the royal rites of the Incwala involve a cutting biting and slicing of the New Year In other words the new temporal cycle is inaugurated by a break with the sacred which is invariably bad when it has infiltrated the community Whether we refer to catharsis or purification purgation or exorcism it is actually the idea of evacuation and separation that is foremost Modern thinkers view the sacred solely as a mediating force because they try to interpret primitive reality in terms of a religion that has been purged of its maleficent qualities But as we have seen any mingling of the community and the sacred whether due to the intervention of gods 268 Violence and the Sacred mythic heroes or the dead produces exclusively maleficent results Every supernatural visitation is prompted by the spirit of revenge Benefits accrue only after the divinity has departed This is not to say that the rnediative element has been eliminated A total separation of the community and the sacred would be fully as dangerous as a fusion of the two Too great a separation can result in a massive onslaught of the sacred a fatal backlash then too there is always the risk that men will neglect or even forget how to implement the preventive measures taught them by the sacred itself as a defense against its own violence Human existence thus remains under the constant tutelage of the sacred and is observed regulated and promoted by it The outcome of this relationship is as follows although men cannot live in the midst of violence neither can they survive very long by ignoring its existence or by deluding themselves into the belief that violence despite the ritual prohibitions attendant on it can somehow be put to work as the mere tool or servant of mankind The complex and delicate nature of the communitys dealings with the sacred the ceaseless effort to arrive at the ordered and uninterrupted accord essential to the wellbeing of the community can only be expressed for want of the naked truth in terms of optimum distance If the community comes too near the sacred it risks being devoured by it if on the other hand the community drifts too far away out of range of the sacreds therapeutic threats and warnings the effects of its fecund presence are lost This spatial interpretation is clearly seen in societies in which the sacred assumes the form of a special personagethe African sacred king for example The presence in the midst of the community of a figure deeply imbued with the sacred poses extraordinary problems In certain cases the king is forbidden to touch the ground for fear of contaminating it and thereby causing the death of his subjects Sometimes too the king is forbidden to feed himself the simple fact of his having touched food makes it unsuitable fare for ordinary mortals And there are cultures where the sacred monster is carefully hidden from view not for his own protection but for that of his subjects who would be struck dead by a single glance from him Such precautions are designed to prevent direct contact They do not mean to imply that it is bad to shelter such an extraordinary being quite the contrary As we have seen the king is both very bad and extremely good the historical alternation of violence and peace is transferred from time to space The results have a faint analogy to modern theories of the transformation of energyperhaps because religious thought habitually draws its models from nature Sacrificial Substitution 269 The kings subjects may feel ill at ease in his presence awed by his sheer superabundance of power his siliwme Nevertheless they would be terrified if they were deprived of his presence Our timidity and respect are diluted forms of these same phenomena There is an optimum distance from which to confront a divine incarnation it permits the reception of beneficent effects without giving access to maleficent ones The absolute can be likened to fire too near and one gets burned too far away and one gets nothing Between these twro extremes is a zone where one is warmed and heartened by the welcome light     ALL SACRIFICIAL RITES are based on two substitutions The first is provided by generative violence which substitutes a single victim for all the members of the community The second the only strictly ritualistic substitution is that of a victim for the surrogate victim As we know it is essential that the victim be drawn from outside the community The surrogate victim by contrast is a member of the community Ritual sacrifice is defined as an inexact imitation of the generative act Why we may ask does sacrifice systematically exclude those who seem the most appropriate victims who bear the closest resemblance to the original the members of the community The need for some distinction between the original victim and the ritual victims can readily be explained If the sacrificial victim belonged to the community as does the surrogate victim then his death would promote further violence instead of dispelling it Far from reiterating the effects of generative violence the sacrifice would inaugurate a new crisis But because certain conditions must be met an organization capable of meeting them does not inevitably have to come into being If we think it does we succumb to the functionalist illusion The second sacrificial substitution still poses a problem that must be resolved We may wonder if the difference between the original and the copy between the primordial and the ritual victim does not have its basis in human reason A kind of basic good sense would effect the shift from within to without the community The functional discrepancy between the two types of victim could easily be taken for the humane1 in the sense of modern humanism aspect of the sacrifice What was referred to earlier as sacrificial trickery would in fact be the sacrifices trickery they would choose to overlook some of the demands of ritual mimesis And their casual atittude toward the gods command would stem from an attitude they share with us moderns deep within themselves they would sense the futility of these and indeed of all rites It is tempting to suppose that the second sacrificial substitution 270 Violence and the Sacred shows that fanaticism has already given way to a primitive skepticism that foreshadows our own Unfortunately this theory will not stand up First of all there are many societies in which the victims are human beings prisoners of war slaves children even in the case of the sacred king and related sacrifices members of the community In these instances there seems to be no second sacrificial substitution This is why the connection between the original violence that had the surrogate victim for object and the ritual imitations that succeeded it is particularly striking in the case of the sacred king In Chapter 4 when I was attempting to clarify the relationship between the surrogate victim and the rite the sacred king served as a convenient example of the proximity of the original victim to the ritual victim This is not to sav that the second sacrificial substitution has been entirely omitted in the case of the sacred king While an exact repetition of the generative violence is impossible the very fact that the future victim has been drawn from the community and is designated to replace the surrogate victim sets him apart from the other members of the community and makes normal relations between himself and these other members impossible He now belongs to a category that can contain only one member at a time but it is one that nevertheless qualifies as sacrificeable to almost the same degree as the categories of cattle and sheep in other societies If the sole fact of being selected as a future victim is sufficient to metamorphose the chosen object to make a sacred personage out of him then it is not hard to uncover the reasoning behind the different choices of original victim and ritual victims When a victim has been killed he belongs to the sacred it is the sacred itself that permits its own expulsion or is expelled in the victims person The surrogate victim thus appears as a monster He is no longer regarded in the same way as the other members of the community If the sacrificeable categories are generally made up of creatures who do not and have never belonged to the community that is because the surrogate victim belongs first and foremost to the sacred The community by contrast has emerged from the sacred and separated itself from it Members of the community then are less suitable as ritual victims than are nonmembers That is why ritual victims are chosen from outside the community from creatures like animals and strangers that normally dwell amidst sacred things and are themselves imbued with sacredness From our vantage point as objective observers the other members of the community seem closer to the original victim and consequently far more suitable in accordance with the theory of imitation as sacrificial objects But the viewpoint of the primordial religious experience is Sacrificial Substitution 211 determined by the generative violence From that perspective the surrogate victim is completely transformed It is this transformation that serves to protect the community from violence that prevents the faithful from choosing one of their own number as a replacement for the original victim and that consequently helps prevent any new outbreak of reciprocal violence If the ritual victim is drawn from outside the communityif the very fact of choosing a victim bestows on him an aura of exterioritythe reason is that the surrogate victim is not perceived as he really wasnamely as a member of the community like all the others This choice should not then be attributed to a kind of primitive skepticism The centrifugal dynamism of the second substitution has its origins in religion itself in protective misapprehension It has nothing to do with a primitive effort to escape the tyranny of religion And if the community is spared it is not because it has violated the law of exact imitation but because it has rigorously observed it Whatever deception is involved in the sacrificial act must be attributed to the scapegoat mechanism not to its beneficiaries We should not conclude however that the surrogate victim is simply foreign to the community Rather he is seen as a monstrous double He partakes of all possible differences within the community particularly the difference between within and without for he passes freely from the interior to the exterior and back again Thus the surrogate victim constitutes both a link and a barrier between the community and the sacred To even so much as represent this extraordinary victim the ritual victim must belong both to the community and to the sacred It should now be clear why ritual victims tend to be drawn from categories that are neither outside nor inside the community but marginal to it slaves children livestock This marginal quality is crucial to the proper functioning of the sacrifice If the victim is to polarize the aggressive tendencies of the community and effect their transfer to himself continuity must be maintained There must be a metonymic relationship between members of the community and ritual victims There must also be discontinuity The victim must be neither too familiar to the community nor too foreign to it We have previously noted that this ambiguity is essential to the cathartic functioning of the sacrifice But we could not explain how it was put into practice nor even imagine how an institution as subtle and complex as that of sacrifice could function without its inventors who are also its operators being aware of the secret of its operation Now we see that there is nothing surprising in this fact at least on the level that concerns us here Ritual requires the sacrifice of 272 Violence and the Sacred a victim as similar as possible to the monstrous double The marginal categories from which these victims are generally drawn barely fulfill this requirement but they provide the least unsatisfactory compromise Situated as they are between the inside and the outside they can perhaps be said to belong to both the interior and the exterior of the community Ritualistic thought does not limit itself to seeking out those categories that are the least unsuited for supplying ritual victims Once the victims have been obtained it strives in various ways to make them conform to its own image of the original victim and simultaneously to increase their quotient of cathartic potential We consider that anything involving this kind of intervention is sacrificial preparation that is our use of the term goes beyond the usual definition of sacrificial preparation as the ritual actions that immediately precede a sacrificial killing The victim should belong both to the inside and the outside of the community As there is no category that perfectly meets this requirement any creature chosen for sacrifice must fall short in one or another of the contradictory qualities required of it It will be deficient in its exterior or its interior connections but never in both at the same time The goal is to make the victim wholly sacrificeable In its broadest sense then sacrificial preparation employs two very different approaches The first seeks to make appear more foreign a victim who is too much a part of the community The second approach seeks to reintegrate into the community a victim who is too foreign to it The sacred king illustrates the first sort of preparation His choice as king is not sufficient to transform this future sacrificial victim into the monstrous double he must reincarnate In order to eliminate his lingering and superfluous humanity in order to cut him off from the community he is required to commit an act of incest thereby absorbing an enormous charge of maleficent sacredness At the end of the period of preparation the king has taken on both the interior and the exterior qualities that are required to transform him into a sacred monster The procedure must be inverted for a victim who sins by an excess of exterior qualities The sacrifice of cattle in the Dinka ceremonies described by Godfrey Lienhardt in Divinity and Experience illustrates this second type of sacrificial preparation6 The Dinka never sacrifice an animal fresh from the herd First it undergoes a period of isolation from its fellow cattle being sheltered in a special place adjacent to human habitations The halter it wears is reserved for sacrificial beasts 6 Cf Chapter 4 pp 9799 Sacrificial Substitution 213 Invocations are pronounced destined to bring it closer to the community and link it to the human members We have already discussed the similar invocations that treat the victim as a human being7 In summary it is apparent that the intimate relationship that normally exists between the Dinka and their cattle remarkable though this relationship may be is still not sufficient for sacrificial purposes The identification between man and beast must be such that the latter assumes the role of the original outcast and draws all the reciprocal hostilities of the community to itself Every member of the community must be able to consider the beast before its metamorphosis into a very sacred object as the logical target for his anger Sacrificial preparations involve many actions that may seem contradictory but all are perfectly adapted to their goals With persistent foresight the religious mind pursues its ends and without realizing it fulfills all the conditions for catharsis Its only interest is to imitate the generative violence as faithfully as possible It strives to procure and if need be to invent a sacrificial victim as similar as possible to its ambiguous vision of the original victim The model it imitates is not the true model but a model transfigured by the mechanism of the monstrous double This transfiguration this primordial difference directs all religious thought toward victims that thanks to their nature and sacrificial preparation are neither divisive nor trivial victims thus assuring for the ritual performance a cathartic value beneficial to the community that enacts it We encounter once again a remarkable fact religious misapprehension figures largely in the very real protection offered society by ritual sacrifice and indeed by religion in general 7 Cf Chapter 1 p 13     Chapter Eleven The Unity of All Rites fSj4 WE MAY NOW TURN our attention to certain ritual   3  N  forms that because of their frankly disagreeable nature are often regarded as aberrations In fact they are neither more nor less explicable than any other rites when viewed without reference to generative violence and they become perfectly intelligible when seen in that context Our discussion of the second type of sacrificial preparationthe integration into the community of a victim of foreign originleads directly into a consideration of the most notorious example of cannibalistic ritual as practiced by the Tupinamba Indians of northwest Brazil1 The Tupinamba occupy a prominent place in the intellectual history of modern Europe The two Indians whom Montaigne met in Rouen and referred to in his Essays were members of this tribe They thus served as models for the most famous preeighteenthcentury portrait of the noble savage who was shortly to play a great role in the history of Western humanism War was endemic among this people who made it a practice to devour all the enemies they could lay their hands on However their cannibalism assumed two distinct forms An enemy killed in the course of battle was eaten on the spot without further ado Outside the community and its laws there was no place for ritual undifferentiated violence held sway The ritual form of cannibalism was reserved for enemies who were brought alive to the village These prisoners lived for months and sometimes years on intimate terms with the men who would one day devour them They participated in their captors daily activities and married into their families much the same relationship existed for a while between themselves and their sacrificers for as we shall see we are dealing with sacrifice here as their sacrificers maintained among themselves The prisoner was subjected to two apparently contradictory modes 11 will discuss only those aspects of the Tupinamba rituals that bear directly on my argument For further information on these practices see Alfred Metraux Religions et magies indiermes dAnterique du Sud Paris 1967 pp 4379 214 The Unity of All Rites 215 of treatment Sometimes his sexual favors were sought after and he was treated with respect and even veneration At other times he was the object of abuse showered with insults and blows Shortly before the date of his execution the prisoners escape was ritually staged Invariably of course he was quickly recaptured and for the first timebound with a heavy rope around his ankles His master now stopped giving him food and he was forced to resort to stealing One of the early travelers cited by Metraux reports that the prisoner was permitted during this period to lay about him with his fists to steal fowl and geese and other things and to do his utmost to avenge his coming death1 In short the future victim was encouraged to violate the laws Most modern observers agree that the purpose of these indulgences was to transform the prisoner into a scapegoat Francis Huxley remarks It is the fate of the prisoner to act out a number of contradictory roles and incarnate them in himself He is an enemy who is adopted he takes the place of the man in whose honour he will be killed he is an inlaw and an outcast he is honoured and reviled a scapegoat and a hero he is intimidated but if he shows fear is thought unworthy of the death that awaits him By acting out these primarily social roles he becomes a complete human being exemplifying the contradictions that society creates an impossible situation which can only end in his death The impossibility is exaggerated when he is charged by ritual with the powers and attributes of the culturehero he becomes the representative of the other world living in the centre of this one a Janus figure too sacred to live with2 This is an admirable summary although it should be added that the recipient of societys contradictory drives does not in the end appear as a paragon of humanity but as a monstrous double and a god As Huxley points out it is the true relationship between society and human nature that is laid forth here and because this truth is intolerable it must somehow be expelled This is where generative violence plays its role its basic function is to get rid of the truth to transpose it beyond the realm of human activity In order to understand this operation we must realize that the surrogate victim actually brings about communal cohesion Indeed ritual cannibalism remains inaccessible to the intellect unless some basis in social reality can be found for it And as long as we insist on interpreting the scapegoat in purely psychological terms we can only assume that cannibals are seeking some sort of moral justification for their acts of violence It is true that the more misdeeds the prisoner commits the 2 Francis Huxley Affable Savages New York 1966 p 254 216 Violence and the Sacred more legitimate the sanctions imposed on him might appear But the primary purpose of the rites has nothing to do with satisfying some neurosis or putting to rest some guilt complex They are meant to bring about solid concrete results If the modern mind fails to recognize the strongly functional nature of the scapegoat operation and all its sacrificial surrogates the most basic phenomena of human culture will remain misunderstood and unresolved The mechanism of the surrogate victim is redemptive twice over by promoting unanimity it quells violence on all fronts and by preventing an outbreak of bloodshed within the community it keeps the truth about men from becoming known The mechanism transposes this truth to the realm of the divine in the form of an inscrutable god The prisoner drew to his person all the communitys inner tensions all its accumulated bitterness and hatred Through his death he was expected to transform maleficent violence into sacred beneficence to reinvigorate a depleted cultural order Ritual cannibalism is a rite that functions like any of the other rites I have discussed The Tupinamba were following a modelor rather their ritual system was following a model They were trying to reproduce an original event that actually took place to recover the unanimity that occurred and recurred around the person of the surrogate victim If the prisoner was treated in two contradictory ways if he was sometimes vilified and sometimes honored it was because he represented the primordial victim He was hated insofar as he polarized the as yet untransformed violence he was revered insofar as he transformed the violence and set in motion the unifying mechanism of the surrogate victim The more detestable the victim was made to appear and the more passion he aroused the more effectively the machinery functioned The role of the Tupinamba prisoner is therefore similar to that of the African king Consecrated by his future death his person representsnot successively but simultaneouslytwo aspects of the sacred He takes upon himself the totality of violence during his lifetime and bears his burden for eternity beyond reach of time It seems likely that the prisoner was intended to reincarnate a mythical hero who in certain versions of Tupinamba legend appeared as a prisoner who was about to be executed and eaten Thus from the perspective of the practitioners ritual cannibalism was designed to reproduce a primordial event The cannibalism of the Tupinambas like the incestuous practices of certain African monarchies inflames our imagination and tends to distract attention from the essential intent of the ritual the basic trait that it shares with all other rituals its sacrificial aspect We are perhaps more distracted by incest than by cannibalism but only because canThe Unity of All Rites 277 nibalism has not yet found its Freud and been promoted to the status of a major contemporary myth Some modern film makers have tried to be sure to bring cannibalism into fashion but their efforts to date have been less than successful Mircea Eliade makes the acute observation that the sacred precedes cannibalism that cannibalism may be said not to exist in a natural state3 In other words the victim is not killed to be eaten but eaten because he has been killed The same is true of animal victims that are afterward eaten The cannibalistic element then requires no special explanation Moreover it serves to help explain other far more mysterious rites The eating of sacrificial flesh whether animal or human can be seen in the light of mimetic desire as a veritable cannibalism of the human spirit in which the violence of others is ritually devoured Mimetic desire once frustrated seeks at once to destroy and to absorb the violence incarnated with the modelobstacle This explains why cannibals are always eager for their victim to demonstrate by a show of courage that he is the incarnation of supreme violence And of course the victim is eaten only after he has been killed after the maleficent violence has been completely transformed into a beneficent substance a source of peace strength and fecundity Once we have recognized that ritual cannibalism is simply another form of sacrificial rite the prisoners preliminary adoption and partial assimilation into the tribe that is going to eat him no longer presents a mystery Because the victim comes from outside the community from the realm of the undifferentiated sacred he is too foreign to be immediately eligible as a proper sacrificial offering If he is to become a true representative of the original victim he must first establish some sort of relationship with the group and be made to appear like an insiderwithout however surrendering that sacred exteriority that remains his essential characteristic Through the process of sacrificial preparation the victim acquires a sufficient resemblance to the natural direct target of violencethat is the other members of the communityto ensure the transference of their aggressions and to make him an attractive sacrificial object At the same time he remains sufficiently foreign for his death not to risk plunging the community into a cycle of revenge The only person able and perhaps to some extent required to espouse the victims cause is his wife But she must not be too insistent in her protests or she too along with her children if she has any will be summarily executed It is now clear how a scrupulous imitation of the surrogate victim though necessarily affected by the transformation of the first victim 3 Mircea Eliade The Sacred and the Profane New York 1961 p 103 21S Violence and the Sacred establishes a system of ritual practices that conforms to the needs of the community These practices ensure the purgation of violence its transference to victims whose relationship to the community is neither too close nor too distant who are in short suitable figures for relieving the community of its burden of violence and effecting its purification It is equally clear that this system including the sacrificial preparation that contributes to the efficiency of the total operation can arise purely and simply from an effort to imitate the original murder the act that either established or reestablished communal unitv The prisoners adoption by the community should be regarded as belonging to the second type of sacrificial preparation referred to above Ritual cannibalism resembles African kingship in that the future victim is consecrated during his lifetime To discern the relationship between the two rites we might think in terms of Jean Genets Deathwatch which deals with a condemned prisoner whose favors are sought by a pair of petty criminalsenemy brothers so to speak who are fascinated by the prospect of his imminent execution The relationship between the African kingship system and the cannibalism of the Tupinambas is somewhat blurred because in the former case the victim is drawn from within the community in the latter from without The process of sacrificial preparation functions in a contradictory manner to achieve the same results in both cases By integrating the prisoner within the community the Tupinamba are pursuing the same goal as the Dinka who separate their sacrificial beast from the herd and shelter it among the villagers Among the Tupinamba the practical application of the principle is carried to far greater lengths And the tribes extraordinary adoption of the prisoner seems to support my theory that the surrogate victim is fundamentally a member of the community a neighbor of those destined to kill him The Tupinamba seem to have been particularly conscious of the nearness of the original victim and in order to reproduce this quality without compromising the sacrificial effectiveness of the rite they devised a system of implacable logic and rare ingenuity H4 A S  T H E C A S E o f t h e Tsimshians see Chapter 9 violence among the Tupinamba is shifted from the interior of the community to the exterior This displacement is sacrificial in character and is by no means limited to mere verbiage the communities actually go to war with one another and devour their respective members Here again it can be said that the tribes have come to an agreement never to agree that a permanent state of war is maintained for the express purpose of providing victims for ritual cannibalism The numThe Unity of All Rites 219 ber of captives on either side should be more or less equal in order to constitute a more or less reciprocal exchange and this exchange would seem somehow to be linked to the exchange of women which is also again as in the case of the Tsimshians accompanied by violence But whether it is a question of prisoners or women the exchange ritualized into warfare and the warfare ritualized into exchange are both variants of the same sacrificial shift from the interior of the community to the exterior Both are equally beneficial in that they keep violence from exploding precisely where it would do the most damage in the midst of the elementary group Thus the interminable vengeance engulfing two rival tribes may be read as an obscure metaphor for vengeance that has been effectively shifted from the interior of the community This displacement is not of course mere shadow play The system works precisely because the intimate rivalry between the groups is very real Moreover it is evident that this sort of warfare cannot always be confined within reasonable limits The various meanings of the word tobajara seem to define the parameters of the type of ritual cannibalism practiced by the Tupinambas In its primary sense it designates the symmetrical posture assumed by the subject in regard to the opposition the hostile confrontation The word is related to a verb meaning to be face to face to be opposite4 It is worth noting with regard to tobajara that the prisoners murder is carried out in a manner that resembles as closely as possible the structure of single combat The victim is tied with a rope but given enough free play to allow him to defend himself for a limited time against the attack of his solitary adversary his own personal tobajara It is not surprising that the word tobajara refers specifically to the victim of cannibalism But the word also has a third meaning brotherinlaw The brotherinlaw is the substitute for the brother the most natural adversary In exchange for one of his women the brotherinlaw is ceded a woman too close to the giver a woman who would inevitably become the object of fraternal rivalry if the men of the elementary community reserved their women for their own use The brotherinlaw then becomes the sacrificial substitute for the brother as hostile object The entire structure of the sacrificial system is implicit in the triple semantic thrust of tobajara And this structure reminds us once more of Greek tragedy which abounds in enemy brothers and enemy brothersinlaw for example Eteocles and Polyneices Oedipus and Creon The ideology of ritual cannibalism brings to mind the nationalistic 4 Huxley Affable Savages p 242 280 Violence and the Sacred myths of our own modern world Of course it is conceivable that the observers have distorted the natives own explanations but even if this were the case the distortions would not effect the general oudine of my interpretation A sacrificial cult based on war and the reciprocal murder of prisoners is not substantially different from nineteenthcentury nationalistic myths with their concept of an hereditary enemy To insist on the differences between two myths of this type is in effect to succumb to the mystique of the myths themselves to turn away from the identical reality residing at the center of each In both instances the basic function of foreign wars and of the more or less spectacular rites that generally accompany them is to avert the threat of internal dissension by adopting a form of violence that can be openly endorsed and fervently acted upon by all In his novel 1984 George Orwell portrays the dictators of two superstates as cynically resolved to perpetuate their struggle in order to maintain permanent control over their mesmerized subjects The institution of ritual cannibalism based on the principle of permanent war and designed to perpetuate domestic tranquillity reminds us that the modern world has no monopoly on such stratagems It also demonstrates that the concept of permanent warfare is not particular to sophisticated and unscrupulous tyrants but can be put into practice by the primitive communities eft4 IT IS NOT DIFFICULT to see the relationship between Tupinamba cannibalism and a theory of ritual based on the concept of the surrogate victim In fact this relationship serves to illuminate aspects of the Tupinamba practice that have hitherto seemed obscure reciprocally the Tupinamba customs bring into relief certain aspects of the theory that my examination of other rites neglected or ignored Limited though they are in number the ritual practices I have mentioned differ gready in character as well as in geographical location Yet in spite of their diversity they all seem to support my claim that the surrogate victim is the basis for all religious systems It might be prudent however to examine still another type of ritual one that may serve to invalidate this line of argument The rites I have discussed up to this point might be said to perpetuate or reinforce certain domestic or religious systems Their purpose is the maintenance of the status quo and this purpose explains why they all center around that exemplary guarantor of cultural stability the unanimous act of violence directed against the surrogate victim These rites may be defined as rites of stability or stasis However there also exists a body of rites generally referred to as rites of passage I have not yet considered such rites in the light of my theory I will The Unity of All Rites 281 not attempt to demonstrate that the surrogate victim lies at the heart of these rites as well Rites of passage have to do with the acquisition of a new status For example there are initiation rites that confer on adolescents full admission to the community In our own society the passage from one status to another presentsat least in theoryonly minor problems of adaptation which are limited to those individuals directly involved in the process those who are actually making the passage Although this belief has been somewhat shaken in recent times it continues to exert a strong influence on our thought and conduct In primitive societies however the slightest change in the status of an isolated individual is treated as if it carried the potential to create a major crisis What to us appear to be perfecdy normal and predictable transitions essential to the preservation of the social unit are regarded by primitive man as portents of apocalyptic upheaval Arnold Van Genneps Rites oj Passage the work that introduced the term into ethnological parlance distinguishes two distinct stages in a primitives change of status In the first stage he loses his previous status and in the second he acquires his new one To attribute this observation to a typically French predilection for neat Cartesian categories would be somewhat unfair for Van Genneps analysis does conform to the processes of religious thought Religious thought does indeed distinguish between these stages perceiving them as quite independent of one another separated by a gap that could well become a terrible abyss swallowing up the entire cultural structure Van Genneps observations serve to underline the critical aspect of the process When he focuses on the initial loss of status he calls to mind that loss of difference I described earlier suddenly we find ourselves on familiar terrain For if all violence involves a loss of difference all losses of difference also involve violence and this violence is contagious Thus we are dealing with the sort of dilemma we encountered in the case of twins Religious thought makes no distinctions between natural and cultural differences Perfectly innocent phenomena can provoke fear but that fear cannot for that reason be dismissed as mere fantasy there is nothing fantastical about its impact or its results The individual who is in passage is regarded in the same light as a criminal or as the victim of an epidemic his mere physical presence increases the risk of violence The slightest loss of difference no matter how isolated the case may be is capable of plunging the entire community into a sacrificial crisis The slightest tear in the social fabric can spoil the whole garment if not promptly attended to dearly the first measure in such a situation is to isolate the victim 282 Violence and the Sacred to forbid all contact between him and the healthy members of the community he must be placed in quarantine All suspected victims are included in this proscription They are kept on the periphery of the community or sometimes even exiled to the forest jungle or desert There undifferentiated violence reigns there is the sacred realm inhabited by beings devoid of those stable differences of that fixed status possessed by men who have freed themselves from the power of the sacred Because the modern mind conceives contagion solely in terms of microbiology it sees no reason why any particular loss of status cannot be restricted to its specific case Primitive societies view the matter differently For them any change in individual status threatens to become universal It is the nature of such changes to spread like a disease the individual becomes the first victim and prime carrier of his own infection In some societies the individual in passage is stripped of his name his history and his family connections he is reduced to an amorphous state of anonymity In collective initiations where adolescents of the same age participate together in rites of passage total equality and unrestricted promiscuity is the rule As we have seen differences disappear in the domain of the sacred only because they are indiscriminately mixed together and become indistinguishable in the confusion To be associated with the sacred is to share in this monstrosity to be lacking in differences or overequipped with them comes to the same thing That is why the initiate can appear both as a hermaphroditic aberration and as a creature with no sexual identity at all The rite of passage is always an awesome experience because it is impossible to predict at the outset what its course will be Although the initiate knows what he is losing he has no idea what he will be taking on Violence will determine the final result of this monstrous mixture of differences and the less one has to do with that the better In short structure and change dont go together And even when change looks predictable to us religious man fears that it might become uncontrollable The idea of a nature subservient to social laws or even to natural laws is utterly foreign to primitive religion Conservative is a word too weak to describe the rigidity of spirit and terror of change that characterizes those societies in which the sacred holds sway The imposition of a socioreligious order appears as an enormous boon an unhopedfor act of grace that could at any moment be withdrawn There is no question of subjecting the order to critical evaluation or comparison of trying to alter and improve it in any way The primitive mind would regard such endeavors as at once impious and insane guaranteed to provoke the violent retribution of The Unity of All Rites 283 the gods The proper posture for man is watchfulness and immobility A single careless gesture could unleash a holocaust in which society would be utterly destroyed Although the prospect of the passage may appear terrifying to the primitive mind it also offers hope After all it was by way of a general outbreak of violence and universal loss of differencethat is by way of sacrificial crisisthat the community achieved a differentiated order in former times And it can be hoped that this crisis will achieve the same results Differences will be restored or established specifically the neophyte will gain his coveted new status A happy outcome must depend on the good will of supreme violence but the community believes that it can influence this outcome by channeling the bad energy into prearranged outlets In order for the final results to match those of the original action however every possible precaution must be taken to follow the original model The neophytes must adhere to the rules laid down by tradition they must try to shape the new event in the mold of the old one For only if the ritual reiterates the original crisis is there hope that the outcome will be the same Such is the reasoning behind these rites of passage We can now readily understand that some of the most bizarre aspects of the rites variations that have previously been dismissed as morbid or perverse are simply the logical outcome of certain basic religious views Instead of avoiding the crisis the neophyte must advance to meet it as his ancestors did before him Instead of fleeing the most painful and terrifying aspects of reciprocal violence he must submit to each and every one of them in the proper sequence The postulant must endure hardship hunger even torture because these ordeals were part of the original experience In some instances it is not enough to submit to violence one must also inflict violence This double obligation corresponds to the bad reciprocity associated with the sacrificial crisis It also reminds us that the celebrants in certain festivals are required to perform a number of actions that are normally forbidden real or symbolic acts of sexual aggression stealing the eating of proscribed foods In some societies cannibalism prohibited at all other times forms the essence of the initiation rites For the Tupinamba the murder of a prisoner constitutes the rite Indeed in many societies the ultimate act of initiation is the killing of an animal or a human being Any man deprived of his status is transformed into a monstrous double For the initiate this transformation is exteriorized Sometimes he assumes the role of an animal threatening to pounce on and devour anyone who comes near him Like Dionysus or the sacred king he becomes a lion or a leopard for the duration of the initiatory crisis expressing himself solely in growls and roars In some rites normally 284 Violence and the Sacred marking the culmination of the crisis he exhibits all the characteristics of violent possession The successive stages of the rites allow us to trace the real or supposed evolution of the crisis Other rites offer additional proof that the entire course of the ceremony is modeled on the original crisis In addition to rites specifically designed to simulate the crisis itself we encounter details that reproduce the unanimous violence directed against the surrogate victim and that clearly serve to bring the whole ritualistic process to a close The introduction of masks at the supreme moment of the process can be taken as a direct allusion to the monstrous double whose presence had already been suggested by the metamorphoses of the neophytes The forms of the ceremonies may vary widely but they all bear witness to the violent resolution of the crisis and the subsequent return to order that is to the neophytes assumption of their new and definitive status The purpose of rites of passage then is to graft onto the model of the original crisis any burgeoning crisis brought into being by a sudden outbreak of undifferentiation in other words to change into certainty that awful uncertainty that accompanies contagious violence With regular repetition and a pattern of success these rites are gradually transformed into simple tests or trials becoming increasingly symbolic1 and formalistic The sacrificial nature of the rites tends to become obscured with the passage of time until finally it is hard to say what the symbols are intended to symbolize e4 AS WE HAVE SEEN there is no real difference between rites of passage and rites intended to maintain the status quo In both cases the model is the same The sole purpose of ritual is to ensure total immobility or failing that a minimum of disturbance If the door is opened to admit change there is always the risk that violence and chaos will force an entry Some change of course is inevitable men cannot be prevented from growing up marrying falling sick and dying But primitive societies have found procedures to direct the dangerous flow of energy generated by these events into channels prepared by the cultural order Some societies even have rituals to cope with the change of seasons Wherever there is a potential for dangerous change the remedy lies in ritual and the rites invariably entail a repetition of the original solution a rebirth of differences The model for cultural stability is identical with the model for noncatastrophic change In the final analysis then rites of passage have the same function and the same origin as all other rites That is not to say that rites of passage do not have distinctive characteristics Their most spectacular elements are modeled on the crisis itself rather than on the resolution of the crisis as is true of most The Unity of All Rites 285 other rites and this emphasis gives them their particular initiatory quality This is also why these rites tend to linger on during periods of general decadence maintaining their hold even when the most fundamental ritualistic practices have fallen into neglect or disappeared completely As we have already observed the generative conclusion is the first thing to disappear This disappearance cuts the umbilical cord so to speak that links all rites to generative violence The rites then appear to exist on their own although this is pure illusion With the passage of time the terror inspired by the original crisis fades from memory The younger generation no longer respects the prohibitions laid down by the religious system or watches jealously over its preservation The younger men have no personal acquaintance with maleficent violence In subjecting them to rites of passage the culture is trying to induce a state of mind favorable to the perpetuation of a differentiated system It attempts to recreate the atmosphere of sacred terror and veneration characteristic of its ancestral period when rites and prohibitions were scrupulously observed The structure of the sacrificial crisis and of generative violence permits us to understand the means by which violence is deflected and diffused in human society and this in turn explains why xites of passage can fulfill a function only as long as they maintain their character as impressive painful and at times almost unendurable ordeals As always it is a question of keeping the sacrificial crisis in check in this instance the concern is directed at the inexperienced neophyte whose youthful impetuosity could well unleash a new crisis Rites of passage give the young person a foretaste of what lies in store for anyone rash enough to neglect or transgress prescribed religious rituals Thanks to these rites successive generations acquire a healthy respect for the awesomeness of the sacred and learn to perform their religious obligations in such a way as to assure the stability of the cultural order Phvsical hardships speak louder than intellectual arguments it is these hardships that make the establishment of the socioreligious order appear an extraordinary blessing Rites of passage thus constitute a vitally important force in the conservation of institutions Thev assure the dominance of generations long gone over generations yet to come It would be wrong however to regard them as a conscious political device for keeping the young in their place a scheme directed by the haves against the havenots As with all the rites discussed previously the mechanisms set in motion by rites of passage can never be fullv anticipated In fact their effectiveness seems to depend on their not being viewed in the context of strict social utility Their efficacy is a consequence of the religious attitude in general which precludes all those forms of conscious social engineer286 Violence and the Sacred ing that modern man likes to think he can detect in the socially efficient traditional organizations  T H E PATTERN RECURS in all forms of initiationinitiation into adulthood into secret societies into a religious order or into a shamanistic fraternity The shamans initiation for instance differs from the others only in the dramatic and rigorous quality of the hardships the initiate must endure and in the explicit identification with a divinity or spirit whose awesome and fantastic adventures recall the mechanism of the surrogate victim The shaman claims mastery over supernatural forces If he wishes to acquire the means of ridding men of illnesses the apprentice shaman must first expose himself to the full fury of these illnessesthat is expose himself to maleficent violence He emerges triumphant from an ordeal that would have killed an ordinary mortal thus demonstrating that he not only enjoys the protection of Supreme Violence but also shares in its power and can even to some extent effect the transformation of bad into good violence Even the most fantastic details of the shamans initiation faithfully reflect a ritualistic viewpoint on generative violence In isolated cultures as far apart as Australia and Asia the initiation culminates in a vision of dismemberment after which the neophyte awakens or rather is reborn as a fullfledged shaman This final vision calls to mind the collective ritual dismemberment of the Dionysiac rites the diasparagmos and many similar rituals of diverse provenance Dismemberment is emblematic of triumph and resurrection it reflects the operation of the surrogate victim the transformation of maleficent violence into beneficent violence The neophyte experiences the same metamorphosis as the mythical creatures whose help he will later require in the exercise of his shamanistic functions And if he manages to secure their aid it will be because he is able to approach them on equal terms as someone who has shared their experiences Shamanism is like a theatrical performance in which one actor plays all the roles at once The lead role however is clearly that of commander in chief of the forces of Good which finally rout the forces of Evil This final expulsion is frequently associated with some kind of symbolic object for example the healer may hold up a twig or a bit of cotton that he claims to have extracted from the body of the patient and that supposedly caused the illness The Greek term for an evil object extracted by means of a similar ritual is katharma This term was also used as a variant of pharmakos to designate a sacrificial human victim In the ritual context of crisis and victimization interpreted as an The Unity of All Rites 287 expulsion of evil the extraction of a shamanistic katharma becomes intelligible The illness is equated to the crisis it can lead either to death or to a cure invariably seen as the expulsion of impurities spiritual impurities in the form of evil spirits or physical impurities in the form of the shamanistic object Once again the process is based on a repetition of a successful scapegoat effect The patient is induced to give birth to his own cure just as the entire community at one time gave birth in the midst of collective violence to a new order The extracted object had no place in the human organism and no right to be there It was something brought in by outside forces It plays the part of the actual surrogate victim whereas the human organism fully mobilized against the invader takes the part of the collectivity If as has long been assumed primitive medicine is indeed ritualistic in nature then it is not surprising that its primary purpose is to reproduce the generative process The word katharsis refers primarily to the mysterious benefits that accrue to the community upon the death of a human katharma or pharmakos The process is generally seen as a religious purification and takes the form of cleansing or draining away impurities Shortly before his execution the pharmakos is paraded ceremonially through the streets of the village It is believed that he will absorb all the noxious influences that may be abroad and that his death will transpose them outside the community This is a mythical representation of what does in fact almost take place The communal violence is indeed drawn to the person of the surrogate victim but the final resolution cannot be described as the expulsion of some substance The interpretation thus approaches the truth but fails to attain it because it fails to perceive three essential facts the mimetic nature of reciprocal violence the arbitrary choice of the victim and the unanimous polarization of hostility that produces the reconciliation To view violence as an impurity or blemish that is located in a physical substance is to materialize violence once again When the shaman draws forth from his patient an object he identifies as the sickness itself he is transferring and transforming this mythical interpretation into yet another formthat of a small insignificant object In addition to its religious sense and its particular meaning in the context of shamanism the word katharsis has a specific use in medical language A cathartic medicine is a powerful drug that induces the evacuation of humors or other substances judged to be noxious The illness and its cure are often seen as one or at least the medicine is considered capable of aggravating the symptoms bringing about a salutary crisis that will lead to recovery In other words the crisis is provoked by a supplementary dosage of the affliction resulting in the 288 Violence and the Sacred expulsion of the pathogenetic agents along with itself The operation is the same as that of the human katharma although in medicine the act of purgation is not mythic but real The mutations of meaning from the human katharma to the medical katharsis are paralleled by those of the human pharmakos to the medical pharmakony which signifies at once poison and remedy In both cases we pass from the surrogate victimor rather his representativeto a drug that possesses a simultaneous potential for good and for bad one that serves as a physical transposition of sacred duality Plutarchs use of the expression kathartikon pharmakon seems meaningfully redundant in this context The translation of this violent process into terms of expulsion evacuation and surgical operations is made in the most diverse cultures For example the Swazi Incwala involves ritual acts whose literal meanings denote the biting cutting and slicing of the new year These words belong to a semantic grouping that includes a variety of highly significant operations from the consummation of the kings first marriage to decisive victory in an armed conflict The common denominator appears to be acute suffering destined to assure recovery from an illness or designed to bring about the natural or artificial resolution of a potential crisis The same grouping designates the therapeutic action of certain substances In the course of the Incwala rites the king spits out magic medicinal potions first toward the east then toward the west The term Incwala is apparently connected with the notion of cleanliness the process of cleansing by evacuation As has been mentioned see above Chapter 4 the ceremony concludes with a great fire that consumes the accumulated refuse of the past year Max Gluckman describes the general effect of the rites in terms of Aristotelian catharsis Katharma and katharsis are derived from katharos If we wished to group together all the themes associated with these terms we would find ourselves with a veritable catalog of the subjects discussed here under the double heading of violence and the sacred Katharma is not limited to the victim or die surrogate object it also refers to the supreme efforts of a mythic or tragic hero Plutarch speaks of the pontia katharmata expulsions that purified the seas with reference to the labors of Heracles Kathairo means among other things to purge the land of monsters Its secondary meaning to whip may appear puzzling in this context until we recall the practice of whipping the pharmakos on the genitals It is worth noting that katharsis is used in connection with purification ceremonies that form part of the mysteries initiation rites The Unity of All Rites 289 the word is also sometimes used to designate menstruation Such usages make it clear that we axe not dealing here with a heterogeneous collection of references but rather with a unified system to which the surrogate victim holds the key Whenever we describe the generative process or its products in terms of expulsion purgation or purification we are attributing natural causes to phenomena that are not in the least natural because they derive from violence Expulsions evacuations and purgations are found in nature the natural model does indeed exist But its reality should not distract us from the extraordinary role that this model has played in the history of the human imagination from primitive religious rituals and shamanistic medicine down to the present day The pattern outlined in Chapter 8 should provide the perspective Violence furnishes the initial impetus for the discovery of the model which is applied in mythic fashion to violence itself in nonmythic fashion to natural phenomena The miracle of restored unanimity prompts the conception of the model which is seen as a combination of natural and cultural influences The human imagination has regularly reverted to it on many and diverse occasions Even today we have not succeeded in sorting the arbitrary from the nonarbitrary elements the useful from the useless the significant from the insignificant This failure has been particularly striking in the field of psychopathology The obsessive concern during the seventeenth century with clysters and bleedings with assuring the efficient evacuation of peccant humors shows plainly that the medical practices of that age were based on the principle of expulsion and purification These practices constitute in fact a slightly refined variant of the shamans approach with its emphasis on the extraction of the physical katharma It is easy to laugh with Moliere at quack doctors and their gargantuan clysters but physical purging for better or for worse is a real process And what about the modern practice of immunization and inoculation The model is the same in both cases clearly its technique and theory can be applied to pseudodiscoveries as well as to real ones The patients defenses according to modern theory must be reinforced so that he can repulse a microbiotic invasion by his own means The beneficent process is still conceived in terms of an invasion repulsed a harmful intruder chased from the premises There is no question of mockery here because the process is scientifically sound The physician inoculates the patient with a minute amount of the disease just as in the course of the rites the community is injected with a minute amount of violence enabling it to ward off an attack of fullfledged violence The analogies abound Booster shots for instance 290 Violence and the Sacred correspond to the repetition of sacrificial rites And of course in all varieties of sacrificial protection there is always the danger of a catastrophic inversion a too virulent vaccine a too powerful pharmakon can promote the illness it was supposed to prevent In the first chapter I used vaccination as a metaphor to illustrate certain aspects of sacrifice Now we can see that vaccination like so many other human institutions really amounts to a metaphorical displacement of sacrifice K ONCE AGAIN WE ENCOUNTER a relic of the primitive mind in modern scientific thinking a reflection of the imaginative impulse set in motion by generative violence We discover that a technological tool of undisputed utility is not unrelated to the crudest sort of ritualistic medicine Certainly we cannot claim that primitive practices stem from a mode of thought that is entirely different from our own Of course there are differences certain substitutions take place and there is a constant shifting of position as one mode of thought merges with another However there is no reason to regard the various results of these operations as separate entities for the process after all consists by definition of a series of displacements analogous to those that went before and those that are due to follow or due not to follow in other words to a series of metaphorical substitutions that owe their variety to the fact that none of them ever wholly succeeds in reproducing the essence of a single unique process If we wish to complete our picture of the various meanings of katharsis we must return once more to Greek tragedy As yet I have made no specific reference to Aristotles use of the term in his Poetics It scarcely seems necessary to do so at this point for I have already established that tragedy springs from mythic and ritual forms As for the function of tragedy Aristotle has already defined it for us In describing the tragic effect in terms of katharsis he asserts that tragedy can and should assume at least some of the functions assigned to ritual in a world where ritual has almost disappeared As we have seen the tragic figure of Oedipus becomes the original katharma Once upon a time a temple and an altar on which the victim was sacrificed were substituted for the original act of collective violence now there is an amphitheater and a stage on which the fate of the katharma played out by an actor will purge the spectators of their passions and provoke a new katharsis both individual and collective This katharsis will restore the health and wellbeing of the community The unity of a given ritual says Victor Turner Li The Drums of Affliction is a dramatic unity It is in this sense a work of art5 If we 5 Victor Turner The Drums of Affliction Oxford Qarendon Press 1968 p 269 The Unity of All Rites 291 agree with this opinionand it would be difficult to disagreethe reverse should be true as well a given dramatic performance constitutes a sort of rite the shadowy similitude of the religious experience The Aristotelian use of katbarsis has provoked endless discussion and will doubtless continue to do so Modern theorists seek to establish the precise sense that the word had for the philosopher They brush aside its religious implications because as they claim these implications were no longer current in Aristotles timewere indeed hardly less obscure then than they are today The modern inability to grasp the nature of these implications makes it even harder to come to terms with Aristotles use of the word Yet in order for the term katharsis to assume a sacrificial character in the Poetics it was not necessary for Aristotle to be aware of the original operation Indeed his ignorance of that operation was almost a requirement If tragedy was to function as a sort of ritual something similar to a sacrificial killing had to be concealed in the dramatic and literary use of katharsis just as it was concealed in the religious and medical use of the term It is precisely because Aristotle failed to penetrate the secret of sacrificial rites that his tragic katharsis ultimately constitutes only another sacrificial displacement It takes its rightful place among all the other displacements gravitating around the generative violence that owes its enduring efficacy to its elusiveness On closer inspection Aristotles text is something of a manual of sacrificial practices for the qualities that make a good1 tragic hero are precisely those required of the sacrificial victim If the latter is to polarize and purge the emotions of the community he must at once resemble the members of the community and differ from them he must be at once insider and outsider both double and incarnation of the sacred difference1 He must be neither wholly good nor wholly bad A certain degree of goodness is required in the tragic hero in order to establish sympathy between him and the audience yet a certain degree of weakness a tragic flaw is needed to neutralize the goodness and permit the audience to tolerate the heros downfall and death Freud touches upon this situation in Totem and Taboo but he leaves the matter unresolved Having accompanied the hero part of the way the audience suddenly perceives him as wholly other and abandons him to his fate his superhuman ignominy and glory The spectator may shudder with pity and fear but he must also feel a deep sense of gratitude for his own orderly and relatively secure existence Every true work of art might be said to partake of the initiatory process in that it forces itself upon the emotions offers intimations of 292 Violence and the Sacred violence and instills a respect for the power of violence that is it promotes prudence and discourages hubris Aristotle is discretely vague about which emotions tragedy is meant to purge But if we see tragedy in terms of a fire used to combat fire it is clear that its purpose is to protect the community against its own violence The philosopher asserts that the only violence appropriate to tragic action is violence between close relatives If tragedy were a direct adaptation of rites as some erudite theoreticians have claimed it would itself constitute a work of erudition and its esthetic and kathartic potential would be in no way superior to that of the Cambridge Ritualists If tragedy is or once was rich in katharsis that can only be attributed to the antiritualistic aspects of its original inspiration Tragedy advances toward the truth in the face of reciprocal violence and while assuming the guise of reciprocal violence But it invariablv draws back at the last minute As soon as mythical and ritualistic differences are seriously challenged they are replaced by cultural and esthetic differences Tragedy thus shares a fundamental experience with ritual Both have advanced to the very brink of that terrible abyss wherein all differences disappear Both have been permanently marked by the ordeal If tragedy has a sacrificial character then it must possess a maleficent aspecta Dionysiac aspect as Nietzsche would put itas well as a beneficent regulatory Apollonian cultural role A parenthetic remark on Nietszche although his classifications are manifestly superior to the approaches of most critics they fail to perceive or at most perceive only dimly that each and every divinity corresponds to both aspects at once The fundamental duality of tragedy led to the opposing formulations of Aristotle and Plato Given his time and place Aristotle was correct to define tragedy in terms of its cathartic qualities But then Aristotle is always correct That is why he is so great and so onesided in his greatness Aristotle is above and beyond the crisis of tragedy He incorporates into his theory all the meanings and reasons that pertain to the misunderstanding of this crisis In choosing xristode as their mentor the formalistic literary critics could not have done better for Aristotle views tragedy solely from the perspective of order In his view the art of tragedy affirms consolidates and preserves everything that deserves to be affirmed consolidated and preserved Plato by contrast is closer in time and spirit to the crisis It is not the stately affirmation of great cultural rites that he discerns in Oedipus the Kwg but rather the undermining of differences Platos attention is caught by tragic reciprocity by those very aspects that are always The Unity of All Rites 293 eliminated by a formalistic or structuralist reading of the drama by all those aspects in short that William Arrowsmith refers to as constituting the plays tragic turbulence6 Paradoxically it was Platos own acute insight into the nature of tragic inspiration that provoked his hostility to drama He saw tragedy as opening a window onto the dark and dangerous origins of social values as somehow posing a challenge to the very concept of civic order In Oedipus the King the publics attention is insidiously diverted from the communitys efforts to rid itself of the pharmakos to the pharmakos itself with whom the poet and poetry tend to side The poet like many a modern intellectual reveals an ambiguous attitude toward those beings whom the stricken city has driven from its precincts in an effort to regain its lost unity Even when he is not actually espousing suspect causes the poet retells ancient timehonored legends in a new way giving them a slightly impious and seditious ring The city says Plato must protect itself from subversion therefore it must rid itself of subversive elements Sophocles must join Oedipus on the road to exile the poet too must become a pharmakos This situation goes unperceived by rationalist and humanist critics Their pursuit of what one might perhaps call the meaning of meanings1 leads them away from the source of tragic inspiration and away from undifferentiated violence By reinforcing and consolidating all the differences they effectively close the interstices through which violence and the sacred can pass They succeed so well that they manage to do away with any cathartic value the work might possess We are left with platitudinous reflections on the works cultural values or with pure erudition pure classification Such critics do not seem to realize that by divorcing tragedy from the essential drama of mankind from the conflict of war and peace and love and hate they are emptying the work of its tragic substance and preparing a new swing of the pendulum back to tragedy Nowhere in their works do we encounter an adequate response to the genuine terror of such a work as The Bacchae7 William Arrowsmith The Criticism of Greek Tragedy Tulane Drama Review 3 no 3 1959 7 The methods whereby the humanistic tradition both ancient and modern has managed to minimize and at times suppress the more horrific aspects of archaic and classical Greek culture surely deserve close study As Henri Jeanmaire has observed Diovysos pp 22830 The fact that this horrific aspect is only rarely alluded to by ancient authors is not wholly fortuitous It is to the great glory of the Greeks that their particular concept of religion and the gods as manifested primarily in their literature art and philosophy served as a bulwark against that ancient fund of cruelty inherent in most religions whose origins are sunk deep in the past Those many myths that pertain all too clearly to human sacrifice myths 294 Violence and the Sacred Any great writer puts critical platitudes to nought and reveals all pronouncements about literature as shot through with ambiguities In the preface to Samson Agonistes Milton lays emphasis on the paradoxical aspect of katharsis that though implicit in Aristotles theory is rather muted The poet comments that a sickness and its cure are one and the same thanks to the kindly intervention of nature But on closer inspection natures model reveals as well as conceals the warring doubles of tragedy who can be discerned in the works of Milton and to some extent in all true dramatic poets Tragedy as it was anciently composd hath been ever held the gravest moralest and most profitable of all other Poems therefore said by Aristotle to be of power by raising pity and fear or terror to purge the mind of those and such like passions that is to temper and reduce them to just measure with a kind of delight stirrd up by reading or generally involving children or young girls suffice to remind us of the hard reality of these barbarous antecedents But there is no concealing the fact that as soon as one strays some slight distance from the main cultural centers traces of these practices could be found usually in the form of local customs or traditional rituals Sheer familiarity a lingering sense of shame ignorance of what was going on in other regions and a reluctance to refer to matters that contradicted the accepted ideal of Hellenism all combined to cast these events into shadow The brutal treatment accorded the pkarmakoi poor creatures used as scapegoats had been greatly reduced in ferocity by the time of Pericles and Socrates and transformed into a sort of old popular custom Nonetheless it could be assumed that things had once been quite different and on the frontiers of Hellenism at Marseilles or Abdera one could still hear tell of pbarmakoi being hurled into the sea or stoned to death Trustworthy witnesses testify that as late as the fourth century religious ceremonies on Mount Lyceum in Arcadia included acts of ritual cannibalism involving the eating of an infants flesh Such considerations can hardly do more than touch upon what is after all a very complex problem but they should serve as a warning not to take too lightly the information contained in certain Christian tracts even though these accounts were written long after the event and derived from the writings of local scholars who like the later Christian polemicists were also voicing their aversion to blood sacrifice The accounts agree that human sacrifices were made to Dionysus    Human sacrifices to Zeus were made at Lyctos And it is interesting to note that Themistocles on the eve of Salamis is said to have sacrificed two young Persians to Dionysus at an inland site on the urging of a soothsayer The authenticity of this account is questionable because it is recorded so late and Herodotus silence hardly adds to its credibility Yet the author of this story was well placed to inform himself on local history and Herodotus reticence may in this case have been deliberate It is not the least paradoxical aspect of our subjectthe traces of archaism in the various cults of Dionysusthat even so abbreviated a treatment as the one offered here can provide a useful introduction to the circumstances that earned our god who had already acquired so many attributes and assumed so many different forms although some of them are more closely connected than has sometimes been thought the great good fortune of becoming the patron god of the Athenian theater and subsequently during the Hellenistic period of the theater as a whole The Unity of All Rites 295 seeing those passions well imitated Nor is Nature wanting in her own effects to make good his assertion for so in Physic things of melancholic hue and quality are usd against melancholy sowr against sowr salt to remove salt humours It is of course essential that we refrain from forcing all arguments of the PlatoversusAristotle type into the uniform mold of moralistic modernism we must resist that dangerous craving for differences that prompts us rigidly to grade and categorize art philosophy politics On the other hand we must not forget that any significant attitude can be transmuted into a ritual The PlatoversusAristotle conflict is no exception we have only to recall those neighboring communities whose ritual systems reflected antithetical solutions to identical problemsthose communities for example in which incest is regarded with horror and loathing and those in which it is an accepted ritualistic practice We can compare Platos attitude to those ritual systems that regard the evil aspects of nature as inexorably evil and do their best to eliminate all trace of them from the community Plato found it impossible to believe that tragic discord or tragic violence could ever become synonyms for harmony and peace That is why he rejects with horror those patricidal and incestuous impulses to which Aristotle and Western culture in general not excluding the psychoanalysts assigned a certain cultural value In our own day the Dionysiac orgy is simply another form of academicism The most daring provocations and the most shocking scandals have lost all power to provoke and shock That does not mean that violence is no longer a threat quite the contrary The sacrificial system is virtually worn out and that is why its inner workings are now exposed to view e4 WHENEVER WE THINK that a stable opposition or a stable difference has been established we discover that the situation has simply been inverted The Platonic rejection of tragic violence is itself violent for it finds expression in a new expulsionthat of the poet Through his very castigation of the poet Plato reveals himself the poets enemy brother his double who like all true doubles is oblivious to the relationship As regards Socrates whom the communityunwilling to soil its hands by contact with an impious creatureasked to do away with himself Platos sympathy is every bit as suspect as Sophocles sympathy for his pharmakoshero Whenever a people has embarked on a tragic course and this was as true for classical Greece as it is for us today no heroes arise only antiheroes The community to which everyone in turn adheres in opposition to the enemy of the moment is betrayed by all just as Thebes was 296 Violence and the Sacred betrayed by Oedipus and Tiresias Ultimately it is this antagonism that causes the communitys death even or rather especially when its defense or its socalled best interests serve to disguise and excuse the unleashed violence Tragedy holds up a mirror to mankind and what men saw reflected in itthe inexorable decay of the polisprompted them to smash it useless and vain though that gesture might be Staring back at these double images we can appreciate the context in which tragedy took place After all the same mocking images glitter before our own eyes today Philosophy like tragedy can at certain levels serve as an attempt at expulsion an attempt perpetually renewed because never wholly successful This point I think has been brilliantly demonstrated by Jacques Derrida in his essay La Pharmacie de Platon8 He sets out to analyze Platos use of the term pharmakon The Platonic pharmakon functions like the human pharmakos and leads to similar results The word is a pivot point between sophistic deception and sound philosophy even though its role is no more justified or justifiable than the violence inflicted on the human scapegoat led through the streets of fair Athens just prior to his execution When Plato applies pharmakon to the Sophists he generally uses it in its maleficent sense of poison When it is applied to Socrates or any Socratic activity however it means remedy Although Derrida refuses to do away with all differences or to treat these differences as null and void he demonstrates that between Socrates and the Sophists the structure of the opposition belies not the difference that Plato would like to establish but rather the reciprocity that is suggested by the recourse to one and the same wrord All difference in doctrines and attitudes is dissolved in violent reciprocity is secretly undermined by the symmetry of the facts and by the strangely revealing even somewhat naive use of pharmakon This use polarizes the maleficent violence on a double who is arbitrarily expelled from the philosophic community From Plato right down to Nietzsche who took a contrary stand the philosophic tradition has piously reaffirmed this absolute difference With Nietzsche the difference was inverted and began to shift back and forthin preparation perhaps for its predestined elimination Platos pharmakon is like Aristotles katharsis And whatever their philosophic intentions may have been it was their literary intuition that led these two men to select terms that seem suggestive but the full pertinence of which may have escaped them In both cases the metaphor is used innocently in the sense that the misapprehension that 8 Jacques Derrida La Pharmacie de Platon in La Disseminatiofi Paris 1972 pp 71197 The Unity of All Rites 291 characterizes all sacrificial ceremonies is innocent In discovering as we believe we have done that these metaphors and their respective objects conceal the same process we have in effect discovered that the metaphoric displacement ultimately alters nothing Behind the various metaphors a scapegoat effect can always be discerned Derridas analysis demonstrates in striking fashion a certain arbitrary violence of the philosophic process as it occurs in Plato through the mediation of a word that is indeed appropriate since it really designates an earlier more brutal variant of the same arbitrary violence The long line of sacrificial forms each derived from the other contains no right form from the point of view of philosophy sociology or psychoanalysis But it does contain one genuine unique event whose essence is invariably betrayed to one degree or another by all the translations and metaphoric derivations that Western thought has produced Derrida proves that translations of Plato in modern languages manage to obliterate still further the final traces of the generative operation For the translations destroy the unity of the term pharniakony they use entirely different words to render pharmakoiremcdy and pharmak onpoison This same process of obliteration was discussed in connection with Benvenistes Dictiomiaire des institutions iidoeuropeennes Sft  I N T H E C O L R S E o f t h i s w o r k  h a v e t r i e d t o demonstrate that generative violence penetrates all forms of mythology and ritual Yet by Chapter 8 which discussed Freuds Totem and Taboo it was clear that the scope of this inquiry would have to be extended For if the mechanism of the surrogate victim is simply another aspect of the original mechanism of the symbolic process then there can be nothing in the whole range of human culture that is not rooted in violent unanimitynothing that does not find its source in the surrogate victim That realization led me to turn my attention to various cultural activities derived from ritual It is now time to enlarge the theory in response to the previous findings We are now moving toward an expanded concept of sacrifice in which the sacrificial act in the narrow sense plays only a minor part If I wish to show that this enlargement of my theory is not arbitrary I must demonstrate that in those localities where ritual killing no longer occurs or where there is no evidence of its ever having occurred its place has been taken by another institution also directly linked to generative violence I have in mind a society like our own or one belonging to late antiquity In Chapter 11 suggested that there was a direct correlation between 298 Violence and the Sacred the elimination of sacrificial practices and the establishment of a judicial system That discussion however preceded the discovery of the surrogate victim Consequently it was not firmly rooted in generative unanimity and now appears inconclusive We must endeavor to fill this breach For if it cannot be proven that the penal system owes its origins to generative violence it might well be maintained that the judicial system is based on rational agreement on a sort of social contract and that men are indeed able to master their social environment in the direct and explicit way that rationalists conceive Such a conclusion would flatly contradict my line of argument Louis Gernet takes up the subject of capital punishment in his Anthropologic de la Grece antique In his discussion the link between punishment and the surrogate victim can be readily discerned Capital punishment takes two seeminglv separate forms the first purely religious and the second purely secular In the first instance The death penalty is a means of eliminating pollution    It purifies the affected group who are often partly or wholly absolved of responsibility for the newly spilt blood this is true at any rate in the case of lapidation The violent expulsion the expulsion unto death of the unworthy or accursed individual has an ancillary sense that of devotio Indeed the killing seems in one sense to be an act of piety It makes us think of those ancient ordinances which declare that the murder of an outlaw does not cause pollution or of that prescription of Germanic law that makes such killing a civic duty    Then too the victim himself fills a true religious function a function parallel to the priestkings who are also put to death The religious function can be seen in the Latin term for these victims homo sacer as well as in the Greek term pharmakos There is no doubt that the death penalty is portrayed here as a direct extension of generative violence Gernet also makes reference to another form of punishment the public exposure of criminals The exposure was sometimes accompanied by a procession through the streets of the community Gernet cites Georges Glotz who compares this procession to katharma rites and links it to Platos suggestion that in his model state criminals should be publically displayed    at the frontiers of the country Laws 855c Glotz considers this mention of frontiers significant his reasons lead us back to our own preoccupation with the surrogate victim and its byproducts One of the tendencies that manifests itself in religious approaches to punishment is that of elimination and more 9 Louis Gernet Sur Texecution capitale in Anthropologic de la Grece antique Paris 1968 pp 32627 The Unity of All Rites 299 particularlyfor the word must be taken in its etymological senseof expulsion beyond the frontiers The bones of the sacrilegious dead are cast out of the community andthis is a wellknown religious practice mentioned by Platothe inanimate object that caused a mans death or the corpse of an animal that killed a person is also subject to expulsion10 The second type of capital punishment was accomplished with the minimum of formalities and is devoid of religious connotations It is an apagogey its rough and ready character might remind us of the frontier justice of xmerican Westerns According to Gernet it was usually visited on criminals who had been caught in the act and it was always ratified by the common accord of the community However says Gernet the public nature of these acts would not have been enough to make the execution of the criminals possible if these criminals had not usually been foreigners that is individuals whose death entailed no risk of endless revenge within the community The second type of capital punishment is very different from the first in formor rather in lack of form Nevertheless the two are related If we acknowledge the role of the surrogate victim in the genesis of religious forms we cannot regard them as independent institutions Generative unanimity operates in both cases In the first type it perpetrates capital punishment by means of ritual in the second type generative unanimity makes an actual appearanceadmittedly in diluted and degenerate form otherwise its appearance would not be possible but savagely and spontaneously nonetheless This latter mode of unanimity gradually evolves into what can perhaps be described as an institutionalized and legalized form of mob violence In neither case can the concept of legal punishment be divorced from its original impulse The concept can be traced back to spontaneous unanimity to the irresistible conviction that compels an entire community to vent its fury on a single individual Legal punishment thus has an aleatory character readily recognizable in the numerous intermediary forms between the religious and judicial spheres notably in the case of the ordeal by fire water single combat etc  Q    AS WE BRING TOGETHER the various elements of our discussion only one conclusion seems possible There is a unity that underlies not only all mythologies and rituals but the whole of human culture and this unity of unities depends on a single mechanism continually functioning because perpetually misunderstood 10G Glotz Solidarite de la famille dans le droit criminel p 25 Cited in Gernet Quelques rapports entre la penalite et la religion dans la Grece ancienne Anthropologic de la Grece antique pp 28990 300 Violence and the Sacred the mechanism that assures the communitys spontaneous and unanimous outburst of opposition to the surrogate victim Such a conclusion may strike some as extreme not to say extravagant It might well be useful at this point to review the analytical approach on which it is based We need one more examplean example that will demonstrate the unity of all sacrificial rites as well as the continuity from these rites to other cultural phenomena that seem at first glance utterly alien to them I have attempted to choose an example that appears essential to the structure of human society the institution of monarchymonarchy as it pertains to sovereigns as well as to political power in general and to the whole idea of central authority The discussion of African monarchies has alreadv shown that isolating ritual incest the most sensational aspect of those monarchies can only lead us astray We cannot treat ritual incest as an independent phenomenon but must keep our sights fixed on the sacrifice even if the sacrificial rites seem dull and ordinary in comparison with ritual incest Sacrifice is the most crucial and fundamental of rites it is also the most commonplace and that is why it sometimes changes form or disappears in the course of the evolution of any given ceremony So ritual forms are mutilated even before they reach those modern interpreters usually eager to further minimize disregard and efface the last traces of generative violence The more peculiar a cultural element appears and the more distinctive its character the more it tends to distract us from essentials unless we take care to place it in its proper context It is the commonplace that truly deserves our attention for the most frequendy encountered cultural elements are the ones most likely to lead us to the truth We have already seen how two variants of the same ritual can stand in opposition for example the festival and what I have called the antifestival or the requiring and prohibition of royal incest Such oppositions stem from different interpretations of the sacrificial crisis Even if the rite takes into account the basic connection between maleficent and beneficent violence it still attempts to establish differences between them for practical purposesdifferences that can never be anything but arbitrary since the beneficial reversal only occurs as a result of the maleficent paroxysm and is in a sense produced by it We have also observed that the striking variation among rites in any given geographical area is far less important than it seems at first glance One has no right to find great significance in one tribes prescription of royal incest and a neighboring tribes proscription of it or to conclude from this difference that one tribe is more timid and fearful the other more daring and liberated The Unity of All Rites 301 The same principle holds true for broad categories of rites their autonomy is only an illusion The inability of religious thought to understand correctly the violent mechanism of its own genesis gives rise to countless interpretations that can all be different from each other because they are all erroneous these interpretations are the rituals and myths of all human societies the world over It does not seem to have occurred to modern theorists bound as they are to their own methodologies to draw together such disparate institutions as the African monarchies the cannibalistic rites of the Tupinamba and the sacrificial ceremonies of the Aztecs However each of these institutions casts light on the other In the Aztec rites a certain time elapses between the election of the victim and his execution During this time every effort is made to gratify his desires The people prostrate themselves before him fight for the privilege of touching his garments He is treated like a king almost like a god Yet this reverential treatment ends in brutal murder The Tupinamba prisoner shares certain similarities with the Aztec victim and the African king In each case the victims situation combines grandeur and misery veneration and ignominy There is the same combination of positive and negative elements though in somewhat different proportions These analogies are too limited and vague however to constitute a solid basis for comparison For instance the ephemeral honors accorded the Aztec victim cannot really be compared to the solid political power enjoyed by the African king As for the Tupinamba prisoner it would be stretching a point to call his position regal Our attempt to bring these three cases together may seem all the more audacious when one considers that their similarities even when clearly distinguishable have nothing to do with the most conspicuous features of each institution ritual incest for the African kings cannibalism for the Tupinamba human sacrifice for the Aztecs These are notable ethnological landmarks and my treatment of them might well seem sheer willfulness and impressionism a reversion to the methods of Frazer or Robertson Smitheven though in this instance the synchronic groupings established by modern scholars working in the field have been taken into consideration At this point the prudent ethnographer might think it is advisable to hold fast the doctrine that a king is a king and a victim is a victim in the same way that a cat is indubitably a cat That some kings are sacrificed and some victims are treated like kings is interesting but nothing more an amusing paradox that can be exploited by literary folk but that has nothing to do with science So prudent an attitude may not be very satisfying but in the absence of any unifying theory it remains unavoidable However everything changes once we begin to realize that the various scapegoat phenomena are not the reflection of some illarticulated guilt complex but rather the very basis of cultural unification the source of all rituals and religion Seen in this light the differences between these three ritual institutions do not appear so great they should not be assimilated to the sort of difference that separates carbon monoxide and sodium sulfate The differences are due to the three different ways in which three societies look at the same process the loss and subsequent recovery of social unity We can now furnish explanations for the strange privileges accorded the Tupinamba prisoner and the ephemeral adoration offered the Aztec victim and we can also glimpse the meaning of the shape of these rites and reaffirm their fundamental unity If my analysis still leaves the reader skeptical if he is still troubled by the differences between the three rituals we can show that many intermediary ritual forms exist that cast doubt upon the apparent specificity of the forms most distant from each other Many societies have kings but it is no longer the king who is the sacrificial victim Nor is it an animal The victim is a human being who stands in for the king he is often chosen from a category of criminals social misfits or classless creatures like the Greek pharmakos Before replacing the real king on the sacrificial altar the mock king replaces him briefly on the throne The brevity of the reign its lack of any real power recalls the Aztec rite but the general context is that of true monarchy At this point the difference between the African king and the Aztec victim begins to blur for we have here a victim who belongs as much to one rite as to the other a victim who is exactly situated between the two On the other hand it should be noted that the mock king reigns over a festival that is brought to a proper sacrificial conclusion by his own death The theme of festival and the theme of sacrifice of a true or simulated king are closely associatedfor instance in the Swazi Incwalaand this is hardly surprising for the festival is nothing more than a reenactrnent of the sacrificial crisis or rather of its resolution by means of the surrogate victim Whenever the restoration of unity is personally attributed to the surrogate victim he is seen as divine royal sovereign The words used to designate himking sovereign divinity scapegoatare nothing more than metaphors used in conjunction with other metaphors Their purpose is to recapture the original act of generative unanimity and they are all different because they never entirely succeed In any ritual interpretation of the primordial event there is always one dominant element that overshadows the others and finally obscures The Unity of All Rites 303 them as the memory of the generative violence fades from the collective consciousness In the festival this dominant element is the joyous celebration of a partially transformed sacrificial crisis In time as we have seen the concluding sacrifice is eliminated as are the rites of exorcism that accompany the sacrifice or replace it When all vestiges of the generative violence have been removed we are left with a festival in the modern sense This is the only kind of festival familiar to the cultural historian and recognizable by him yet he must understand its ritual origins in order to understand its evolution The greater vitality these rites possess and the closer they are to their common origin the more futile becomes any attempt at classification Of course difference pervaded these rites from the beginning for the principal function of the surrogate victim is to restore and solidify difference but at the outset differentiation remains circumscribed and limited it has not yet begun to proliferate The rite constitutes the original interpretation of the generative violence It sets up an initial imbalance between the reciprocal aspects of the sacred between the maleficent and beneficent elements With the passage of time this imbalance becomes greater and greater the feature that was originally given prominence relegates all the other features to the background and finally banishes them altogether At this point the rational viewer might well conclude that any connection between the maleficent and the beneficent elements is a logical contradiction and therefore unworthy of consideration A choice it seems must be made between the accented and unaccented elements the continued impoverishment of the latter prompts the rational observer to dismiss them as superfluous appendages introduced into the rite by mistake Wherever contradictions still exist reason insists that we do away with them The moment comes when we find ourselves confronting two institutions that appear wholly unrelated The whole thrust of Western thought with its insistence on differences prevents us from perceiving their fundamental unity So firmly entrenched is this habit of thought that this effort to uncover the common origins of all rites will be misunderstood by many people as my own inability to differentiate between them Royal incest is not truly essential to the African concept of monarchy either from the point of view of origins in which it is subordinated to sacrifice or from the point of view of evolution of passage into the monarchal institution What is essential is the granting of authority during his lifetime to someone who is designated as a future victim and who draws his power and prestige retroactively from the reconciling power of the original scapegoat With the passage of time 304 Violence and the Sacred the substitute victims authority becomes more durable more stable the factors opposing it lose their importance and another victim human or animal is substituted for the king Everything that has to do with the reverse side of supreme authoritywrongdoing and humiliation maleficent violence and sacrificial punishmentbecomes merely symbolic and soon disappears from view The vestiges of ritual are like traces of chrysalis clinging to an insect they are soon discarded Sacred royalty is transformed into royalty pure and simple into political power When we consider the monarchy of the Ancieri Regime in France or any other traditional monarchic system we cannot help wondering whether it would not be more profitable to consider these institutions in the light of sacred kingship than in the light of modern ideas about monarchy The concept of Divine Right is not just a fiction made up on the spur of the moment to keep the king s subjects in line The life and death of the monarchic concept in Franceits sacred rites its fools its cure of scrofula through the royal touch the grand finale of the guillotineall this is clearly structured by the influence of sacred violence The sacred character of the kingthat is his identity with the victimregains its potency as it is obscured from view and even held up to ridicule It is in fact then that the king is most threatened The master of these paradoxes the most daringly perspicacious interpreter of the monarchic principle in a world not so far removed from our own is Shakespeare He bridges the gap between the most primitive concepts of kingship and the most modern he seems to have been better acquainted with both than we are with either The dethronement scene in Richard II can be seen as a sort of coronation performed in reverse Walter Pater described it as an inverted rite11 but all rites demand that moment of inversion The king acts as his own sacrificer transforming himself by quasireligious means into a double of all his enemies and their surrogate victims as well He is himself a traitor in no way different from those who do him violence Mine eyes are full of tears I cannot see But they can see a sort of traitors here Nay if I turn mine eyes upon myself I find myself a traitor with the rest For I have given here my souls consent Tundeck the pompous body of a king  51244 n Walter Pater Appreciations London 1957 p 205 The Unity of All Rites 305 In his study of the duality of the kings person as portrayed in legal documents of the Middle Ages The Kings Tivo Bodies Ernst Kantorowicz undertakes an analysis of Richard 11 Although he does not touch directly upon the question of the surrogate victim he gives an excellent description of the dual nature of the Shakespearean monarch The duplications all one and all simultaneously active in Richard Thus play I in one person many people 55 31are those potentially present in the King the Fool and the God They dissolve perforce in the Mirror Those three prototypes of twinbirth intersect and overlap and interfere with each other continuously Yet it may be felt that the King dominates in the scene on the Coast of Wales 311 the Fool at Flint Castle 3111 and the God in the Westminster scene 41 with Mans wretchedness as a perpetual companion and antithesis at every stage Moreover in each one of those three scenes we encounter the same cascading from divine kingship to kingships Name and from the name to the naked misery of man12 We may go a little further and ask ourselves whether this description does not transcend the subject of monarchy strictly conceived to embrace broader concepts of sovereignty and indeed all forms of central power that owe their existence to the surrogate victim There are perhaps two fundamental types of society which overlap to some extent those having a central authority essentially monarchal in character and those having no such authority disclosing no trace of generative violence in their political institutionsthe socalled dual systems The first group for reasons unknown to us tends to cluster around a single representative of the original victim an individual whose status is more or less permanent who concentrates political as well as religious power in himself Even if this power is subsequently fragmented the tendency toward centralism persists It is worth noting that structuralist ethnology shows little interest in those societies that no longer reveal any significant opposition between dual forces In this instance the opposition between the two extremes has been interiorized It can indeed find exterior expression in the conflict between king and fool for examplebut this always seems like an afterthought a development of secondary importance The unstable character of historical0 societies is perhaps reflected in this royal interiorization in each one of us this play of differences undifferentiation and scapegoating in each one of us which encourages tragedians to treat the surrogate king like the prototype of human 12 Ernst Kantorowicz The Kings Two Bodies Princeton 1957 p 27 306 Violence and the Sacred beings caught up in a constant state of crisis and plagued by an unending vacillation of differences Q93 ALL RELIGIOUS RITUALS SPRING from the surrogate victim and all the great institutions of mankind both secular and religious spring from ritual Such is the case as we have seen with political power legal institutions medicine the theater philosophy and anthropology itself It could hardly be otherwise for the working basis of human thought the process of symbolization is rooted in the surrogate victim Even if no example taken alone offers conclusive proof of my theory their cumulative effect is overwhelming all the more so because they coincide with archetypal myths that tell in apparently naive fashion how all mans religious familial economic and social institutions grew out of the body of an original victim The surrogate victim as founder of the rite appears as the ideal educator of humanity in the etymological sense of educatio a leading out The rite gradually leads men away from the sacred it permits them to escape their own violence removes them from violence and bestows on them all the institutions and beliefs that define their humanity In the great Indian texts dealing with sacrifice we discover the same content though in slightly different form as in the origin myths In the beginning the gods sacrificed a man when he was killed his ritualistic virtues deserted him They entered a horse the gods sacrificed the horse when it was killed its ritualistic virtues deserted it They entered a cow the gods sacrificed the cow when it was killed its ritualistic virtues deserted it They entered a sheep the gods sacrificed the sheep when it was killed its ritualistic virtues deserted it They entered a goat the gods sacrificed the goat When it was killed its ritualistic virtues deserted it and entered the earth The gods dug for them and found them in the form of rice and barley And that is why today we still dig the earth to procure rice and barley13 Durkheim asserts that society is of a piece and that the primary unifying factor is religion His statement is not a truism nor does it dissolve religion in social institutions Durkheim believes that men are shaped culturally by an educational process that belongs to the sphere of religion Even concepts of space and time he says stem from religion Durkheim never fully articulated his insight for he never realized what a formidable obstacle violence presents and what a positive resource it becomes when it is transfigured and reconverted through the mediation of scapegoat effects Human society does not begin with the fear of the slave for the 3 GatapathaBrahmana 1 2 3 67 in Sylvain Levi La Doctrine du sacrifice dans les Bralymanas Paris 1966 pp 13657 The Unity of All Rites 507 master as Hegel claims butas Durkheim maintainswith religion To carry Durkheims insight to its conclusion I will add that religion is simply another term for the surrogate victim who reconciles mimetic oppositions and assigns a sacrificial goal to the mimetic impulse At the moment when differentiated unity is urgently needed and apparently impossible to obtainthat is during an outburst of reciprocal violencethe surrogate victim comes to the rescue The role of the surrogate victim can be ascertained I believe even on a spatial plane There is good reason to think that it has imposed its image on the very structures of some communities at those special locations forming the center of the community sites generally dedicated to the spirit of collective unity and whose true nature is sometimes brought to light through archaeological investigation In Greece these sites include the tombs of heroes the omphalos the stone of the agora and finally that perfect symbol of the polis Hestia the common hearth Louis Gernefs essay on these sites leaves this reader at least with the overwhelming conviction that these are places where the surrogate victim met his death or where he was believed to have died The traditions attached to these localities and the ritualistic functions associated with them lend credence to the theory that sacred mob violence formed the origin of the polis This mob violence can take the form of the Bouphonia which we have referred to on several occasions or it can take the form of the public exposure of criminals or other punishments that recall the pharmakos Further research along the lines of the surrogate victim would undoubtedly turn up even more conclusive evidence There is reason to believe that these symbolic sites of unification gave birth to all religious forms it was there that the various cults were established spatial relationships fixed the clock of history set in motion and the beginnings of a social life plotted out precisely as Durkheim envisioned it There everything begins from there everything emanates there everything returns when discord breaks out Surely that is the point of the only direct quotation we have of Anaximander the earliest voice of Western thought I would like to repeat those astonishing words here to show that such a claim is not unbelievable In the evolution from ritual to secular institutions men gradually draw away from violence and eventually lose sight of it but an actual break with violence never takes place That is why violence can always stage a stunning catastrophic comeback The possibility of such an occurrence conforms to the dire predictions of divine vengeance that are to be found in every religious system His rejection of this 308 Violence and the Sacred apocalyptic message explains why Heidegger has rejected the traditional translation of Anaximanders words But it seems to me that he has missed the point completely for the vengeance Anaximander alludes to is wholly human not divine in other words not mythic I shall revert therefore to the more traditional translation of Anaximander which Heidegger went out of his way to criticize but which seems to me marvelously apposite Where things are born there too must they perish for each in turn metes out punishment and expiation for its wickedness each in the allotted time14 14 Cf Heidegger The Anaximander Fragment in Early Greek Thinking trans David Farrell Krell and Frank A Capuzzi New York 1975 Conclusion e   3  j  A THEORY OF THE NATURE of primitive religion    W  has emerged from the foregoing inquiry into the origins of myth and ritual No attempt will be made here to consider the JudaeoChristian texts in the light of this theory or vice versa that must be left to a future study However I hope to have suggested here the course that such a project might take My theory depends on a number of basic premises Even if innumerable intermediary stages exist between the spontaneous outbursts of violence and its religious imitations even if it is only these imitations that come to our notice I want to stress that these imitations had their origin in a real event The actuality of this event over and above its existence in rite and record must be kept in mind We must also take care not to restrict this event to any one context any one dominant intellectual framework whether semantic or symbolic which lacks a firm basis in reality The event should be viewed as an absolute beginning signifying the passage from nonhuman to human as well as a relative beginning for the societies in question The theory of the surrogate victim is paradoxical in that it is based on facts whose empirical characteristics are not directly accessible These facts can be drawn exclusively from texts that invariably offer distorted fragmentary or indirect testimony We can only gain access to the generative event through constant reference to these enigmatic sources which constitute at once the foreground in which our theory situates itself and the background against which its accuracy must be tested The theory of evolution depends on the comparison and linkage of evidencethe fossil remains of living creaturescorresponding in the case of my hypothesis to religious and cultural texts N o single anatomical fact studied in isolation can lead to the concept of evolution No direct observation is possible no form of empirical verification even conceivable because evolution occurred over a span of time entirely out of scale with the span of human existence In the same way no single textmythic religious or tragicwill yield the operating procedures of violent unanimity Here too the 309 310 Violence and the Sacred comparative method is the only one possible If this method has not been successful to date that is because there are so many variables at work it is hard to locate the single underlying scheme that controls them all The theory of evolution toor constitutes a hypothesis The surrogate victim theory presents as a theory a distinct superiority over the theory of evolution The inaccessible character of the generative event is not merely an obstacle unrelated to the theory an aspect that contributes nothing of positive value rather it is an essential part of that theory something we cannot do without In order to retain its structuring influence the generative violence must remain hidden misapprehension is indispensable to all religious or postreligious structuring And the hidden nature of the event corresponds to the researchers inability to attribute a satisfactory function to religious practices My theory is the first to offer an explanation of the primordial role that religion plays in primitive societies as well as of mans ignorance of this role This hidden nature is much less problematic than a notion like the unconscious of Freud A comparison of certain myths and rituals viewed in the light of Greek tragedy leads to the theory of the surrogate victim and violent unanimity through a path much more direct than that of verbal slips to such psychoanalytic concepts as suppressed desires and the unconscious Surely such slips can be attributed to many different causes But the surrogate victim theory is the only hypothesis that accounts for all features of the cultural phenomena presented here Ujilike the psychoanalytical explanations it leaves no areas in shadow and neglects no major aspects Although generative violence is invisible it can logically be deduced from myths and rituals once their real structures have been perceived The further one advances along this path and the more transparent the true nature of religious thought appears the clearer it becomes that there is nothing here to suppress or to hide There is no justification for the idea that religious thought either represses or deliberately refuses to acknowledge a threatening selfawareness Such awareness does not yet present any threat to religion It is we who are threatened by it we who flee from it If religious misapprehensions were to be regarded in the same light as psychoanalysis regards its material we should require some religious equivalent to the Freudian repression of the patricideincest desire something that must be hidden and kept hidden Yet such is hardly the case To be sure there are many details of the generative event that have dropped out many elements that have become so warped misshapen and transfigured as to be unrecognizable when reproduced in mythical or ritualistic form Yet no matter how gaping the lacunae Conclusion 311 may appear no matter how grotesque the deformations they are not ultimately indispensable to the religious attitude the religious misapprehension Even if it were brought face to face with the inner workings of the mechanism the religious mind would be unable to conceive of the transformation of bad into good of violence into culture as a spontaneous phenomenon calling for a positive approach It is natural to assume that the bestconcealed aspect of the generative mechanism will be the most crucial element the one most likely to render the sacrificial svstem nonfunctional if it becomes known This aspect will be the arbitrary selection of the victim its essential insignificance which contradicts the meaning accumulated upon its head by the scapegoat projections Close examination will reveal that even this aspect is not really hidden it can be readily detected once we know what we must look for Frequently the rituals themselves are engineered so that they include an element of chance in the choice of the victim but mythologists have never taken this into account Although we have already called attention to those rites designed to give a role to chance in the selection of the victim it may be that we have not put sufficient stress on this essential aspect Sporting contests and games of chance appear to modern man most incongruous as ritual practices The Uitoto Indians for example incorporate a balloon game into their ritual and the Kayans of Borneo use a top in the course of their religious ceremonies Even more remarkable apparently even more incongruous is the game of dice that figures in the funeral rites of the Canelos Indians Only the men participate in this game Divided into two rival groups and lined up on either side of the deceased they take turns casting their dice over the corpse The sacred spirit in the person of the dead man determines the outcome of each throw The winner is awarded one of the dead mans domestic animals which is slaughtered on the spot and the women prepare a meal from it for the assembled mourners Jensen in citing these facts remarks that the games are not simply additions to established religious practices1 If one were to say that the Canelos Indians play at dice during the funeral rites of their parents one would be conveying the wrong idea of the ceremonies For this game takes place only in conjunction with these funeral rites It is modern man who thinks of games of this sort as exclusively secular and we must not project that idea onto the Canelos Indians This is not to say that our own games have nothing to do with rites in fact they 1 Jensen Mythes et cultes chez les peuples primitifs pp 7783 312 Violence and the Sacred originate in rites But as usual we have got things reversed For us games of chance are a secular activity upon which a religious meaning has been superimposed The true state of affairs is precisely the opposite games originate in rites that have been divested to a greater oi lesser degree of their sacred character As I have already remarked Huizingas famous theory of play should be inverted It is not play that envelops the sacred but the sacred that envelops the notion of play Death like any passage entails violence The passage into the beyond by a member of the community may provoke among other difficulties quarrels among the survivors for there is always the problem of how to redistribute the dead mans belongings In order to meet the threat of maleficent contagion the community must have recourse to the universal model to generative violence it must attend to the advice of the sacred itself In this particular case the community ha perceived and retained the role of chance in the liberating decision II violence is given free play chance alone is responsible for the ultimate resolution of the conflict and the rite tries to force the hand of chance before violence has had the opportunity to act The rite aims straight at the final result achieving as it were a minimum expenditure ol violence The Canelos dice game offers a clue to the reason why the theme oi chance recurs so frequently in folklore myth and fable Oedipus ii will be remembered refers to himself as the son of Tychethat is Fortune or Chance There were towns in the ancient world in whicl the selection of magistrates was made by drawing lots for the powe bestowed by ritually regulated chance always contains a sacred ele ment the sacred fusion of opposites Indeed the more we reflect oi this theme of Chance the more universal it appears In popular legem and fairy tale Chance is often invoked to find kings or conversely and the converse is always the other face of the same coin to desig nate someone to undertake a difficult or perilous mission a mission tha might involve selfsacrifice for the general goodsomeone in short t assume the role of surrogate victim On tirata la courte paille Pour savoir qui serait mange2 Yet is there any way of proving that the motif of Chance has it origin in the arbitrary nature of the violent resolution There ar numerous instances in wrhich the drawing of lots so clearly support the meaning proposed here that it is virtually impossible to doubt th connection One such example is the Old Testament Book of Jonal God tells Jonah to go forth and warn the people of Nineveh that thei 2 From  etait un petit navire folkloric French song ed Conclusion 313 city will be destroyed if they do not repent of their ways Hoping to evade this thankless task the reluctant prophet embarks on a ship sailing forTarshish But the Lord sent out a great wind into the sea and there was a mighty tempest in the sea so that the ship was like to be broken Then the mariners were afraid and cried every man unto his god and cast forth the wares that were in the ship into the sea to lighten it of them But Jonah was gone down into the sides of the ship and he lay and was fast asleep So the shipmaster came to him and said unto him What meanest thou O sleeper Arise call upon thy God if so be that God will think upon us that we perish not And they said every one to his fellow Come and let us cast lots that we may know for whose cause this evil is upon us So they cast lots and the lot fell upon Jonah Jonah 147 The ship represents the community the tempest the sacrificial crisis The jettisoned cargo is the cultural system that has abandoned its distinctions The fact that everybody calls out to his own particular god indicates a breakdown in the religious order The floundering ship can be compared to the city of Nineveh threatened with destruction unless its people repent The forms may vary but the crisis is always the same The passengers cast lots to determine wrho is responsible for the crisis Chance can always be trusted to reveal the truth for it reflects the will of the divinity The lot designates Jonah who proceeds to confess his culpability Then the men were exceedingly afraid and said unto him Why hast thou done this For the men knew that he fled from the presence of the Lord because he had told them Then they said unto him What shall we do unto thee that the sea may be calm unto us for the sea wrought and was tempestuous And he said unto them Take me up and cast me forth into the sea so shall the sea be calm unto you for I know that for my sake this great tempest is upon you Jonah 11012 The sailors attempt to gain the shore by their own efforts they would like to save Jonahs life But they finally recognize the futility of their efforts and address themselves to the Lordeven though he is Jonahs Lord and not their own Wherefore they cried unto the Lord and said W e beseech thee 0 Lord we beseech thee let us not perish for this mans life and lay 314 Violence and the Sacred not upon us innocent blood for thou O Lord hast done as it pleased thee So they took up Jonah and cast him forth into the sea and the sea ceased from her raging Then the men feared the Lord exceedingly and offered a sacrifice unto the Lord and made vows Jonah 11416 What we see here is a reflection of the sacrificial crisis and its resolution The victim is chosen by lot his expulsion saves the community as represented by the ships crew and a new god is acknowledged through the crews sacrifice to the Lord whom they did not know before Taken in isolation this story tells us little but when seen against the backdrop of our whole discussion each detail acquires significance Modern man flatly rejects the notion that Chance is the reflection of divine will Primitive man views things differently For him Chance embodies all the obvious characteristics of the sacred Now it deals violently with man now it showers him with gifts Indeed what is more capricious in its favors than Chance more susceptible to those rapid reversals of temper that are invariably associated with the gods The sacred nature of Chance is reflected in the practice of the lottery In some sacrificial rites the choice of victim by means of a lottery serves to underline the relationship between Chance and generative violence In an essay entitled uSur le symbolisme politique le Foyer commun Louis Gernet cites a particularly revealing ritual which took place in Cos during a festival dedicated to Zeus The choice of victim was determined by a sort of lottery in which all the cattle which were originally presented separately by each division of each tribe were mixed together in a common herd The animal ultimately selected was executed on the following day having first been introduced to Hestia and undergone various rites Immediately prior to the ritual presentation Hestia herself receives homage in the form of an animal sacrifice3 At the close of the previous chapter I noted that Hestia the common hearth in all probability marked the place where the original act of communal violence was perpetrated It seems more than likely therefore that the selection of the victim by lottery was meant to simulate that original violence The selection is not made by men but left to divine Chance acting through violence The mixing together of the cattle that had originally been identified by tribe or by division of 3 Gernet Anthropologic de la Grece antique p 393 Conclusion SIS tribe is particularly revealing This deliberate confusion of distinctions this merger into a communal togetherness constitutes an obligatory preamble to the lottery clearly it was introduced to reproduce the exact order of the original events The arbitrary and violent resolution that serves as a model for the lottery takes place at the very height of the sacrificial crisis when the distinctions delegated to the members of society by the cultural order succumb to the reciprocal violence and are merged into a communal mass Q A TRADITIONAL DISCUSSION of Dionysus involves a demonstration of how he differs from Apollo or from the other gods But is it not more urgent to show how Dionysus and Apollo share the same characteristics why the one and the other should be called divine Surely all the gods despite their differences have something in common something from which all their distinctive qualities spring Without such a common basis the differences become meaningless Scholars of religion devote themselves to the study of gods and divinity They should be able to provide clear and concise definitions of these concepts but they do not They are obliged of course to decide what falls within their field of study and what falls outside it yet they leave the crucial and most decisively scientific task of defining their subject to uninformed public opinion Eren assuming that it is possibleor justifiableto stretch the concept of divinity to include each and everybodys idea of the divine the socalled science of religion can neither do without this approach nor provide a convincing defense of it There is no true science of religion any more than there is a science of culture Scholars are still disputing about which cult Greek tragedy should be ascribed to Were the ancients correct in assigning tragedy to Dionysus or does it rightfully belong to another god Undoubtedly this is a genuine problem but it is also I think a secondary one Far more important but far less discussed is the relationship between tragedy and the divine between the theater in general and religion Whether my theory proves to be true or false it can I believe lay claim to being scientific if only because it allows for a rigorous definition of such terms as divinity ritual rite and religion Any phenomenon associated with the acts of remembering commemorating and perpetuating a unanimity that springs from the murder of a surrogate victim can be termed religious The surrogate victim theory avoids at once the impressionism of the positivist approach and the arbitrary and reductivist schemata of psychoanalysis Although this theory brings together many crucial 316 Violence and the Sacred aspects of mans experience it offers no simple substitute for the wondrous profusion of the worlds religious systems Indeed one ought perhaps to ask whether this profusion is really as wondrous as all that in any case the mechanism proposed here carries us beyond the mere cataloging of characteristics The endless diversity of myths and rituals derives from the fact that they all seek to recollect and reproduce something they never succeed in comprehending There is only one generative event only one way to grasp its truth by means of my hypothesis On the other hand there are innumerable ways of missing it hence the multiplicity of religious systems My thesis results from an eminently positive line of inquiry 1 have a certain confidence in languagecontrary to some modern thinkers who at the very moment when truth becomes accessible in language declare that language is incapable of expressing truth This absolute distrust of language in a period of mythic dilapidation like our own may well serve the same purpose as the excessive confidence that prevailed before the dilapidation when no decisive truth was in sight Our theory should be approached then as one approaches any scientific hypothesis The reader must ask himself whether it actually takes into account all the items it claims to cover whether it enables him to assign to primitive institutions an origin function and structure that cohere to one another as well as to their overall context whether it allows him to organize and assess the vast accumulation of ethnological data and to do so in a truly economical manner without recourse to exceptions and aberrations Above all he must ask himself whether this theory applies not in single isolated instances but in every conceivable situation Can he see the surrogate victim as that stone initially rejected by the builders only to become the cornerstone of a whole mythic and ritualistic edifice Or as the key that opens any religious text revealing its innermost workings and rendering it forever accessible to the human intellect  THAT INCOHERENCE TRADITIONALLY attributed to religious ideas seems to be particularly associated with the theme of the scapegoat Frazer treats this subject at length his writing is remarkable for its abundance of description and paucity of explanation Frazer refuses to concern himself with the formidable forces at work behind religious significations and his openly professed contempt for religious themes protects him from all unwelcome discoveries The notion that we can transfer our guilt and sufferings to some other being who will bear them for us is familiar to the savage mind It arises from a very obvious confusion between the physical and the mental beConclusion 311 tween the material and the immaterial Because it is possible to shift a load of wood stones or what not from our own back to the back of another the savage fancies that it is equally possible to shift the burden of his pains and sorrows to another who will suffer them in his stead Upon this idea he acts and the result is an endless number of very unamiable devices for palming off upon some one else the trouble which a man shrinks from bearing himself In short the principle of vicarious suffering is commonly understood and practised by races who stand on a low level of social and intellectual culture4 However the disrepute in which he is held today is far from justifiable for few scholars have labored so diligently in the field or set forth their findings with such admirable clarity And many later writers have in effect done little more than repeat in somewhat different form Frazers own profession of ignorance Anyone who tries to subvert the sacrificial principle by turning it to derision invariably becomes its unwitting accomplice Frazer is no exception His work contributes to the concealment of the violent impulse that lurks within the rite of sacrifice Such phrases as physical loads and bodily and mental ailments recall nothing so much as the platitudes of secondrate theologians and Frazer treats the act of sacrificial substitution as if it were pure fantasy a nonphenomenon Yet authors closer to our time have done the same and with considerably less excuse for the Freudian notion of transference inadequate as it is in some respects should at least have alerted us that something vital is missing from the picture The modern mind still cannot bring itself to acknowledge the basic principle behind that mechanism which in a single decisive movement curtails reciprocal violence and imposes structure on the community Because of this willful blindness modern thinkers continue to see religion as an isolated wholly fictitious phenomenon cherished only by a fewr backward peoples or milieus And these same thinkers can now project upon religion alone the responsibility for a violent projection of violence that truly pertains to all societies including our own This attitude is seen at its most flagrant in the wrriting of that gentlemanethnologist Sir James Frazer Frazer along with his rationalist colleagues and disciples was perpetually engaged in a ritualistic expulsion and consummation of religion itself which he used as a sort of scapegoat for all human thought Frazer like many another modern thinker washed his hands of all the sordid acts perpetrated by religion and pronounced himself free of all taint of superstition He wras evidently unaware that this act of handwashing has long been recognized as a purely intellectual nonpolluting equivalent of some of the most an4 J G Frazer The Golden Bough 1 vol abridged New York 1963 p 624 318 Violence and the Sacred cient customs of mankind His writing amounts to a fanatical and superstitious dismissal of all the fanaticism and superstition he had spent the better part of a lifetime studying The sacrificial character of this misunderstanding should remind us that today more than ever before we will encounter resistance when we try to rid ourselves of ignoranceeven though the time has come for this ignorance to yield to knowledge This resistance is similar to what Freud calls resistance but far more formidable We are not dealing with the sort of repressed desires that everyone is really eager to put on public display but with the most tenacious myths of modernism with everything in short that claims to be free of all mythical influence What I have said of Freud holds true for all modes of modern thought most particularly for ethnology to which Freud was irresistibly drawn That ethnology is alive today when the traditional modes of interpretation are sick unto death is evidence of a new sacrificial crisis This crisis is similar but not identical to previous ones We have managed to extricate ourselves from the sacred somewhat more successfully than other societies have done to the point of losing all memory of the generative violence but we are now about to rediscover it The essential violence returns to us in a spectacular manner not only in the form of a violent history but also in the form of subversive knowledge This crisis invites us for the very first time to violate the taboo that neither Heraclitus nor Euripides could ever quite manage to violate and to

Tiers of Pride and Shame  Quillettehttpsquillettecom20190116tiersofprideandshame 353But an isolated event doesnt indicate a systemic problem Like so many things nowadaysextrapolating from a single event to a crisis is only wrong when your opponents do it Just afew months ago many commentators on the Right extrapolated asupposed crisisof illegalimmigrant crime from the murder of a single American by an illegal immigrant At the timeprogressives recognized this for the irrational fearmongering that it was Yet it is the sameawed logic that extrapolates an alleged crisis of campus racism from a single racist incidentBesides there remains the question nearly unaskable in polite company of whether vonAbeles drunken diatribe was actually racist to begin with Sure it was narcissistic selfpityingand belligerent But was it an expression of bigotryAt a glance its hard to reconcile the belief that von Abeles comments were bigoted with thefact that black activists routinely get praised for making similar statements Von Abelesremark I love myself and I love white people sounds eerily similar to I love my blacknessand yours the Twitter mantra of Black Lives Matter leader Deray McKesson Were whitemen we did everything nearly echoes a statement made in a commencement speech byAlicia Garza a cofounder of Black Lives Matter Without black womenthere would be nome no you no us no civilized society of which we speak WeI you and mewe oweeverything to black women Von Abeles monologue universally condemned took linesstraight from the scripts of Americas most celebrated racial justice advocatesOn the prejudicepluspower conception of racism von Abeles position in the racial privilegehierarchy as a white person renders his comments racist whereas McKesson and Garzaspositions as members of a historically marginalized group renders theirs permissible if notenlightenedA great way to instantly be seen as a naf a racist or both is to ask why this double standardexists The answer of course is historical context Black people were brought to America inchains forced to work as chattel subjugated formally and informally for a century aerabolition all the while ghting to see themselves as beautiful in a culture hellbent onconvincing them they were ugly stupid and inferior Black race pride therefore is a rejectionof and an adaptation to the racist elements in Americas reprehensible past One cannotmake the same claim about white race pride which historically has been more associatedwith brutal oppression than with noble rebellionThis history lesson is without doubt important But does the fact of antiblack racismwhether past or present overt or systemic prove that its okay for a white person to bebanned from a campus for saying things that black people get ovations for Decent ethicalpeople are supposed to vigorously nod yesor better yet not ask the question at allSHAREPrivacy  Cookies This site uses cookies By continuing to use this website you agree to

collection of students surrounding him he added the caveat I donthate other people I just love white menStudents and administrators reacted to the incident with unanimous condemnation BarnardCollege Columbias sister school banned von Abele from campus Many argued that vonAbeles tirade should be understood not as an isolated event but as a symptom of theuniversitys ongoing complicity in white supremacya systemic problem calling for asystemic solution Columbias Black Student Organization led the charge with a list ofdemands including extra time for aected students to complete their nal

Tiers of Pride and Shame  Quillettehttpsquillettecom20190116tiersofprideandshame 453Yet the view that black people cannot be racist would have been alien to the civil rights leadersand activists of yesteryear who experienced far more antiblack racism than the leaders ofBlack Lives Matter do today Bayard Rustin Martin Luther King Jrs strategist and the chieforganizer of the March On Washington was arrested no less than 23 times during an era ofprofound racism He nevertheless considered it obvious that blacks could be racist just likewhites and he vocally opposed such racism wherever he encountered it  The same is true ofEldridge Cleaver an early leader of the Black Panther partyBut more to the point if we decide to give black activists a free pass to express racial pridebecause they face racial slights why not allow von Abele the same pass Aer all Columbiascampus is no stranger to antiwhite rhetoric Take for instance the criticism commonlyheard in Columbia dorm rooms that the Western canon is decient because its lled withdead white men Does having to hear the likes of Homer Plato and Rousseau dismissed notas bad writers but as writers of your race qualify you to express race pride in responseAnd the dead white men trope is only the tip of the iceberg In my two and a half years onColumbias campus I can count my experiences of antiblack racism on one handindeedone nger By comparison I could ll a small diary with the antiwhite comments someintended in jest and others in earnest that Ive heardI sometimes wonder how I would feel if I had to hear Frederick Douglass Bayard Rustin andJames Baldwin dismissed in casual conversation not as bad writers but as dead black men Iwonder whether I would have the presence of mind to dismiss such statements as harmlessnonsense or whether the experience of hearing my heroes derided in explicitly racial termsterms that linked their inadequacy to my own racial identitywouldnt awaken a sense ofgrievance within me I wonder moreover how I would feel if I couldnt complain12SHAREPrivacy  Cookies This site uses cookies By continuing to use this website you agree to their use To nd out more including how to

Quillettehttpsquillettecom20190116tiersofprideandshame 553Von Abeles error was not that he expressed white racial pride His erroralong withMcKessons and Garzaswas to play the racial pride game at all The notion that your valuelies in your membership to the race you were born into by chance makes no sense takingcredit for the achievements of other people with whom you share a skin color makes nosense Rustin put it well when he observed that the breastbeating white makes the sameerror as the Negro who swears that black is beautiful Both are seeking refuge inpsychological solutions to social questionsWhats more pride and shame are two sides of the same coin so if collective pride makessense then collective shame makes sense too The same awed logic that allows von Abele tofeel proud of the accomplishments of dead white men should lead him to feel ashamed oftheir sins Conversely the progressive logic that encourages modernday whites to feel shamefor slavery and colonialism should also lead them to feel pride for their ancestorsachievements Both white chauvinists and white progressives dogmatically reject one half ofthe prideshame binary Both factions should go one step further and reject the concepts ofcollective pride and collective shame altogetherThe massive gulf between how we treat expressions of white pride and black pride isunsustainable I dont expect the gulf to collapse into a colorblind singularity overnight thatwould be unrealistic But anyone who values consistency and believes that a persons skincolor is irrelevant to their moral character should want at a minimum to begin narrowingthe gulfColeman Hughes is aQuillettecolumnist andan undergraduate philosophy major atColumbia University His writing has also appeared in theSpectator City

more black folk have arrived voluntarily than the total whodisembarked in chains before the United States outlawed international slave tracking in 1807 More havebeen coming here annually  about 50000

wouldnt exactly call having to leave ones war torn country voluntarily And they did not choosethe US on their own volition it was dictated by international policies I suspect many refugees would rathersafely be in their country of birthmj its not like all of Africa was simultaneously at war If those refugees did prefer to live in their homecountries they would have moved back when things stabilisedjimhaz what is your estimate for the number of slaves who entered the US between 1787 and 1807 Myestimate is less than 200000 But I might be wrong Do you have access to other estimates for this numberWhat is your estimate for the total number of black immigrants into the US between 1807 and now Mine isover two million But I know of no good estimates of this numberIf you or Coleman Hughes or others could provide your own estimates for these numbers this would behelpful I am honestly afraid to even publicly describe a model to estimate these numbersmj could you elaborate on your

against discrimination on the basis of race He says that everybody ought to be treatedthe same Tito Perdue simply disagrees He is hoping that being inammatory will make racialreconciliation more

zealotry I am very impressed with Coleman Hughes article I think it should bewidely distributed and understood by anyone who cares about the world I would add that I am veryimpressed with his writing and ideas This is indeed one of the best articles I have read in a long timeI agree with Constantin Bizarrely I think Tito Perdues comment adds to the discussion here If one is topass the ideological Turing test you need the positions of those you disagree with to clearly outline theirbelief in the light of day reprehensible as they may beI agree also that tito perdues comment should be le up It appears to be a sincere attempt to express astupid perspective I think comment deletion should be reserved for actual trolls people making commentsthat are clearly insincere and meant only to incite conict or those being verbally abusive or threateningviolence We can handle seeing terrible ideas like titos expressed in a civil manner and they can potentiallyadd something valuable to the discussion as an example of the type of philosophy Coleman Hughes articleis arguing againstAsenath WaitePoint by point tho what about Titos views do you nd stupid or reprehensible I suspect his views are farmore extreme than mine but to give the Devil his due we should articulate what we might disagree withnot merely denounce him For example I myself do not think that racism is a wonderful institution but I dothink that Tito is correct that it represents the default position of 99 of humanity over 99 of historicaltime Fact is that we are all racists Indeed studies have shown that folks who declare themselves to be nonracist are subliminally more racist than otherwise I myself am a racist  like everyone else  but I prefer todeal with it upfront rather than pretending that Im not Being honest gives you a handle on your ownmind For example whereas I recognize the fact that in SS Africa the average IQ is about 70 I also see thatMr Hughes  being an individual and not only an

for whites to have white pride as it is for blacks to have black pridebecause the color of ones skin is not a reason for pride or shame There is nothing intrinsic about aparticular color of skin that merits either sentiment The mere possession of one or another color of skinshould not be a reason for shame or pride but the content of our character and our behaviorHowever and there is always a however the color of ones skin does lead to dierent experiences of theworld oen from our earliest days primarily because of the existence of racism and the mistaken belief thatthe color of our skin reveals something intrinsic about us and our character According to the best science itdoes not It reveals nothing about us as individuals except perhaps the length of time since our lineage leAfricaUnfortunately humans have tended to categorize each other ranking each other in various ways and skincolor and other supercial physical traits have historically been a way of doing so This has led to individualsand groups having dierent rights experiences of justice and unequal access to the benets of our societyTherefore we should acknowledge that individuals and groups have dierent experiences because ofpossessing dierent skin colors and the social economic and political consequences of having the wrongor right color of skin depending on the context It would be a mistake to pretend that skin color hasnt anddoesnt still have an impact on our daily lives It does The objective should be to work towards a worldwhere skin color no longer results in dierential experience of rights freedoms and benets of our worldAll of us could feel pride at working for and achieving thatthe mistaken belief that the color of our skin reveals something intrinsic about us and our characterBut of course this is NOT a mistaken belief To be a member of a more evolved race does reveal a great dealabout a persons quality The lunatic notion of racial equality has by now made such progress that I dont seehow our civilization can survive for much longerNothing is equal the races least of all If the races were equal countries would be equal whereas in fact therehas never existed a blackmajority state that wasnt a hell on earth For white people to impute equality toblack people is akin to ranking rap and rock with Beethoven and Wagnertito perdueDid you write Fur Elise Neither did I The overall accomplishments of a race of people do not confer valueon individuals belonging to those races If you judge an individual based on the average attributes of therace they happen to belong to that is wrong from both a rational and in my opinion moral perspective Itsan inarguable fact that there are massive numbers of black people who are far more intelligent andaccomplished than massive numbers of white peopleJanuary 17 2019tito perdueJanuary 17 2019Asenath WaiteJanuary 17 2019S H A R EPrivacy  Cookies This site uses cookies By continuing to use this website you agree to

a report to our executive function as to what around us is potentially dangerous  and it isbrutally honest since if functions below the level of PC Why are black cops just as likely as white cops toshoot young black men disproportionately Because all cops know what they know which is that youngblack males are something like 20 X more likely than people at large to be carrying a gun and prepared touse it on them True In the best of all possible worlds they would have time to make a less stereotypeddecision but in the real word we all make this kind of generalization and sometimes act on it very quicklyIt is indeed the fact that many blacks are highly intelligent but the fact also is that only 15 of blacks inAmerica have above average intelligence I know that and so do you even if you pretend that you dont Isuggest that what we should try to do is not try to stop our appraisal mechanism from doing its job ratheron the executive level we should try to put that report aside and force ourselves when possible toremember that everyone is an individualGetting tired might not read all comments but so far Ray Andrews is exactly right about everythingBest line I know there are racial group mean dierences in IQ and so do you even though you pretendyou dontRay AndrewsI thought the stats showed that cops didnt actually shoot black people disproportionately to white people Ibelieve I read that in cases of a suspect resisting arrest cops were found to be more likely to use deadly forceon white suspects over black suspects likely hesitating more in the latter case for fear of the greaterrepercussions associated with killing a black suspectAlso Im well aware of the IQ thing but that doesnt contradict anything I said in my comment Seems likeyoure just reiterating what tito said here I fully agree with your last sentence which also doesnt contradictanything I said Its reasonable to have some degree of prejudice regarding any person or situation based onprior knowledge of similar persons or situations but one should be willing to readily set aside this prejudicewhen new information regarding the particular circumstance or individual in question is

My Lady you are clearly trying to be reasonable Yes per policeincident blacks are not shot more oen but overall they are shot more oen due to being so much morelikely to be involved with the cops But

people to embrace the solutionIf I had grown up in San Francisco I would be racist against black people I was there a week for aconference and every black person I saw was hugely overweight obnoxious disrespectful and stupid Theone exception was a beautiful kind thoughtful black woman working security at the conference whostopped me to compliment me on being the only one smiling She was from Alabama and said she foundSan Francisco much more racistThis was in sharp contrast to the black people I had grown up with in Montreal a friend in elementaryschool and her family Her dad was a lawyer and her mom a stayathome parent who took us out to thepool on summer days while my mom was working They lived in a gorgeous mansion and my friends littlesister was as adorable and wellbehaved as a princess I couldnt help but contrast my poor white self mysingle mom and dysfunctional family with these amazing successful people Those early experiencesformed my subconscious impression of black people in a way I didnt understand until I saw their oppositein San FranciscoIf we want people to not treat others badly because of their race those people need to grow up with apositive view of people of other races That can only happen if everyone attempts to represent their racewell It will take time and probably be rejected by the le because it asks people to take responsibility forhow they are perceived but we are not going to program out our natural urge to categorise We shouldinstead work with it such that no child grows up with the impression people of a certain race are badThe problem is not what he said it is their intolerance of someone from a race they have pathologisedexpressing pride in his race as they express pride in theirs It is their disordered view and bigotry towardwhites which see it as an aront They project their own bigotry onto him They see White Supremacybecause they wish for Black Supremacy  its in their doctrines If you look at Critical Theory Race Studiesit is the disgust at Whites that mirrors Nazi race theory  the exact same thing  anything they have theystole anything they do causes harm eorts at peace are a lie eorts at defence like the lad above are signsof inherent aggression It wouldnt matter what he said or did  they would see it as an oence to thembecause they are bigoted because they have been taught bigotry  antiwhite bigotry Its not what hessaying its their reaction Everyone is allowed to express pride in their people  so are Whites If someonetakes oence to that thats their problem We are not prisoners of historyps if I hear a black guy saying he loves being black it doesnt aect me at all  good on him or an Englishguy loves being English great for him too If hes a White Supremacist Nazi its not his love for his ownpeople but his hate for others I object to There is too much policing of the discourse stoked by insanetheories coming from Grievance Studies that make everything into an oence because it is a rigidJanuary

agree I still cant believe how angry people acted when someone le a sign that said its ok to be white Inthe Western countries its the same nonsense The sign is being called racist as though it actually saidanything racist at all It sounded to me like a response to the rhetoric being spewed in the schools that wantto shame white kids for things they never did They want them to feel bad for having parents that madebetter choices than others have They have lectures from giant black women with no credentials weainginappropriate and unprofessional attire like skin tight bodysuits and talking out their asses about all whitepeople are racist and thats that How they can think their problems stem from racism and not theirbehavior or their lack of decorum or their refusal to talk like an intelligent adult White people had damnwell better show embarrassment for their skin color If black students want to dictate who can be on campusand who cant it better happen or there will be an immature response like screaming in the yard at aprofessor over Halloween costumes The demand that this kid be punished is insane so what if a drunk kidsaid he likes white people and pointed out uncomfortable truths he didnt say anything rude or mean aboutanyone elses heritage Its ubsurd that BLM riots are called protests The students and falculty at evergreendemonstrated the worst behavior and disrespect for their professors and colleges over alleged constantracism claims that were never elaborated on just claims of racism They had that nasty woman professorleading them shouting to the most racist things that school ever heard Professors of color besides her whowerent black got in on the hysteria too by accusing a white professor who dared to argue back and althoughhe was a good 20  away when he pointed towards her she acted like he violently attacked her Then thereare all the hate hoaxes on campus Students at Drake actually painted a street black because of alleged notesturns out the black student sent themselves the notes I can go on but you cant cry about oppression whilebeing oppressive thats hypocritical The le is outrageous with their hypocritical antics Is it suprizing tosee people call bullshit on the racists who cry racism These progressive dumbasses expect the world cater totheir personal micro aggressions well everyone except white kids Because if you correct the pronunciationof words to a non white kid its racist It used to be called teaching but now its bad How about everyoneadmit things have gone so far that its laughable I think thats what this kid was expressing more than whitepride Not everything is racist Quit trying to ban everything Everyone should be expected to showauthorities and superiors respect Everyone should be held to the same rules Everyone should have to dothe same work at the same time as everyone else We got minority groups who cry racism for being treatedas equally as everyone else They cant be allowed to keep getting away with this shit Its counterproductiveGiving students of color more perks and longer times to do the same work or exemptions from tests justbecause they get loud and make threats will make people think they didnt earn their degrees or positionsand noone respects that Some of these alleged professors dont seem to have any sort of intelligence nor dothey sound educated Look at our Congress we

what racialprejudice really feels likewell not really especially in the USA maybe more so in europe and denitely more in asia and intertribalviolence and prejudice in africa is no picnic either like try being the wrong tribe in kenya when the otherone is in poweri think a strong argument can be made that being black in the places you mention is the best place to beblack its certainly the best place for blacks nancially as american blacks are the worlds richestWhat a stupid fucking response American blacks have more money than blacks in Africa so racism is no bigdeal Jesus you dumbasses

you have been duped Later in the samearticle you are quoting they admit that the incident did not begin by von Abele targeting a group ofminority women but instead began by him shouting his support for Trump in front of the library THEYconfronted HIM upon hearing him shout his support for Trump THEY are the ones who on video werepointing their ngers into his face and even started lming him and encouraging him to continue Itsabsolutely clear that he was not the aggressor he was just a drunk kid shouting about how he supportedTrump and this group came and confronted him leading to the videoHe was certainly not the aggressor It is a deliberate lie to pretend that he was just shouting at a group ofblack women that he loved white people they clearly came to him and engaged with a drunk guy shoutingpolitical stu Not once did he ever demean any other race not once did he express any form of hatred Hadhe been a nonwhite student saying the exact same things he not only would have been

as a positive expression is not as bad as expressing hatred or angertowards a group based on skin tone religion ethnicity etc based on crimes committed in the pastWhat is a huge problem is that racism and sexism have become accepted and instituitionalised againstsupposedly powerful groups basically white men There is a widespread narrative that white men should becriticised and actively discriminated against because they are white and male based on the supposed crimdsof white males in the past In this context arguing that white men in thd past have achieved many positivethings is antiracist rather than racist It would be unnecessary and perhaps inappropriate if not for theendemic systematic and instutuionalised racism and sexim in american academic instituitionsTeh reaction to this statement versus countless others which laud black achievements shows the reality ofdiscrimination in these environmentsGiven the actual context it is arguably a brave if arguably foolish act of resistanceThe racist aspect of this seems to be a mostly US phenomenen there are examples in the UK but far rarer asan import from the US which sits uneasily in British culture The sexism part is endemic in western cultureand seems to continue to get worseWould the Bronze Age Ancients considered the founders of Western Civilization be considered White ifthey were transported in time to now Not likelyDividing people into such massive oversimplications as Asians Blacks and Whites and then ascribingcommon traits to all of them especially ancestral sin helps no one to understand our world and our place init None of these groups are monolithic culturesPersonally speaking as a pale person I nd being lumped in as a White to be spectacularly tedious Thereare nations of pale people who if they were dark would be held up as yet more examples of victims ofWhite colonial aggression These folks are lost to time and ideology blamed for the actions of theirconquerors if they exist at all I am a lucky mutt of at least two of these nations18th century European colonialism was the foreign policy of a small number of coastal European countriesdecided and enacted by a tiny coterie of elites And yet because of surface similarities with thosenationalities it is a truism that all pale people the world over without exception and no dark peoplewhatsoever were enriched because of it irrespective of history and logicPlease consider this it is a glaringly obvious fact that dierent breeds of dog have quite dierent attributesBorder collies make excellent sheepdogs corgis are generally quite

around for this too if you care to look for it of those who runthose intellectual cess pits it is not surprisingThe problem is that there is insucient data because it is politically incorrect to study such dierences Theobvious model to use would be admixture studies based on the fact that there has bee some genetic mixingof black and white genes for centuries One piece of evidence for this is the

wouldnt put that one on your cups and mugsIts still amazing to me how the several racists who comment here have decided that Race leaving aside howone can precisely delineate races or seperate the social construct element from the biological element is theproper framework through which to understand human dierence Of all the Theories of Dierence itsgenetic determinism and some weird quasi familial anity for people with the same shade of skin and facialfeatures that for them best explains why the world is the way it is Forget other variables of basic historicalcontingency or environmental constraints or advantages  no the proper way to construct societies createsocial bonds and trust and to formulate a ranking of social values is through extended tribal networks basedon physical appearance And this is supposed to be the hidden truth of the world That barbarism shouldbe the normative model of human societyEven if you took the most aggressive bell curve arguments at face value theres more overlap betweengroups near the middle of the distribution than there is nonoverlapping disparity at the tails Meaning thateven if we used our as yet very limited understanding of genetic determinism as a serious social sortingmechanism wed still have a very large multiracial mix of people in the average range including slightlybelow and above Maybe some groups would be greatly overrepresented in the top ranges and some othersin the bottom but the mediocre middle would still be the multicultural hell these white chauvinists detest somuch The only way to resolve this is by instituting racial collectivism for how individuals are treated whichnegates the very concepts of individual agency and merit We already saw how this works in practice formost of American historyThe Commies wanted a totalitarianism dened by class membership the Nazis wanted one dened bynational and ethnic membership and these white supremacists being the least sophisticated will settle formere appearance and culture aka the particular parochial traditions and customs of some white people insome places As if some MAGA hat wearing redneck is the cultural custodian of Aristotle Beethoven andDescartes rather than gun fetishism and dumbeddown evangelical christianityDeciding what crew to run with based on physical attributes or blood ancestry is what barbarians do in premodern tribal societies or inside modern prisons Great fucking modelsRegardless of genetic determinism one splitsecond look at a person contains way more information thanyoud like to admit Of course there is much more information to be gained by getting to know anindividual but that takes a major investment in time that isnt practical for many purposes One doesntneed a racist view of the inherent

It is the Warriors whodemand equal outcomes when the incomes are not equal Sorry but they arentIm sure youre aware of the studies that Peterson likes to cite about gender dierences in occupationalchoice in egalitarian Scandinavian countries They suggest that when you remove environmental obstaclesto equality biological dierences maximiseIn the same vein for those who believe biological factors of intelligence or good personality traits are farmore inuential and heritable than is considered polite to say in the current climate the best strategy toprove this theory is to actually capitulate to most of the equity policies favored by the social constructioniststo level the playing eldIf the bio determinists are right no amount of external leveling will change the underlying intractableforces that drive inequality and as a bonus social constructionism can be strongly debunked because theywere able to run their experiment and will run out of excusesWouldnt they

Columbia has a Black Student Organization If thats true could they also have a WhiteStudents Organization Ill bet not by the same double standardGood thoughtful article as usual Regarding the last point  that pride in or shame for ones ethnic identitymakes no sense that seems like a reasonable take at rst but I have come to the conclusion that its not quiteas simple Pride and shame in ones own deeds and achievements are the emotions that come with therealization I did something well I should do more of that and I messed that up I should stop that or goabout it dierently respectively Perfectly reasonablePride and shame in ones group  it could be the family the university the town or the race ethnicityculture  stand for the realization the group is doing good and I should joyfully participate in whatevertheyre doing or what this group is doing is fucked up I should not participate and either dissociate fromthem or get them to change their ways Which would be an entirely justied reaction if youd been borninto to pick an obvious example Hitlerera Germany Even though ones inuence on the group issometimes just a drop in the ocean these are still important and worthwhile sentiments both for theindividual and for keeping the community on trackPride and shame in ones groups past achievements and deeds is a little tricker Obviously I cant changeanything about the past and I didnt have a hand in it one way or another but its still helpful to ask if whathappened was on the whole good or shameful and which aspects of culture that led to one outcome or theother are still active If they are good aspects then take pride and cultivate the traditions if they are bad feelshame if you are involved with them and work to discontinue them Makes good sense to meOf course things are always brighter or darker shades of gray rather than unalloyed good or evil and shamefor some aspects of your culture shouldnt demolish your selfworth if you are a good person and neithershould pride in your group elevate you above members of other groups That said compared to thecompetition those white men havent done that bad globally speaking and people who try to

entry point for theworst of our natural tendencies If you have time to indulge prideful thinking then you are probablyneglecting practical matters that deserve more of your attentionWhen Mr Hughes got to mentioning pride I had hoped he might help us dierentiate racial pride fromracial identity If ones racial or ethnic identity was merely conscious or incidental rather than instrumentalthen we could dispense with a lot of unnecessary tension and discuss more important thingsThis article lled me with so much hope for us all and it felt like a light switched on in my head When youhear something that articulates a truth you always knew but couldnt express Thank you Coleman Hughesfor your workUnfortunately I also read some of the comments and this Tito person makes my stomach turn over andreminds me that we all balance on a razors edge between the best and worst humanity is capable of Hereshoping for the best   pride and shame are two sides of the same coin   Both factions should go one step further and reject theconcepts of collective pride and collective shame altogetherThis is a VERY important point that is is need of claricationPride and shame are indeed two sides of the same coin which is the coin of shared tribal or nationalidentity which is fundamental to being human evolved human nature itself being inherently tribalI have been able to extend my sense of tribal identity from my extended family which is where it evolvedto being English to being a Native Briton which includes Scots Welsh  Irish to Native European that isall the peoples of Europe  their

ie my entire white European RACE which is pretty good going I think it embraces 100s ofmillions of people but that is where my sense of shared tribal identity ENDSI can identify with people of a dierent race at a personal level but not as a grouptribe as I can and do withmy own race I identify with white Americans in general because we share the same race but not with nonwhite Americans anymore than they would identify with me I am I guess a white nationalist oridentitarian as were Americas founding fathers who were the original white nationalistsI feel pride in white achievements  shame for the terrible things we have done both to ourselves and toothers and I think this a good thing Coleman Hughes suggestion of doing away with collective ie tribalidentity pride  shame I think a very bad idea reminiscent of how communism sought to change humannature to suit its own endsWe need to understand and learn how to work WITH human nature which as I say in inherently tribalinstead of demonising it which is what academics are in the habit of doing in the service of their stateemployer which wants everyone regardless of race to identify with itself as their tribe or nationI tweet on this these issues a lot and invite anyone who is interested to take a lookhttpstwittercomrogerahicksstatus1008227827945213952Why are you able to extend your feeling of kinship and belonging to a huge collective of millions ofstrangers some of whom have very little in common with you other than ancestry or appearance and yetyou cannot muster this sense of belonging with people who may have many things in common with youbut have a dierent appearance or color or ancestryYouve already abstracted your tribal anities to the broader concept of RACE which encompasses millionsand has heavily socially constructed parameters Why do you think you chose race and not religion ornation or some other proposition of shared value Why raceAnd given that you did not choose your race or the lineage of your birth is your endorsement of collectivepride or shame based on some metaphysical sense of collective agencyresponsibility or is it more of asocial phenomenon to signal group loyalty for strictly instrumental reasonsIn the real world how are we seeing extending our feeling of kinship to other racial groups playing out forEuropeans around the world Hows that working out for us Seems to be were being dispossessed andpiecemeal ethnically cleansed out of our own lands with people smugly and triumphantly telling us that wewont exist in the future and thats a good thingIt seems that if

subject to discussion or debate Its all just aquestion of virtue signaling  on both sidesWhat I nd disturbing is that trying to stay in principle is very rare  even those who are supposedlycentrist like the Quillettians or those who follow the IDW folks get apoplectic when one of them sayssomething that isnt squarely against what is perceived as SJW Trying to steer a conversation that stays

they hear people being disparaged for being members of aparticular race eg dead white men Therefore I think the drunk kid was wrong to express personal pridein the accomplishments of others of his race but right to speak out against racist attitudesIf the civilizational challenge is to overcome the tribalism on which our survival depended since thebeginning of time I can not see how strident identitarian politics provide a viable answer I strongly believethat it is the most misguided way to reverse the progress of the last 100 years and of sowing discord andmistrust among people exactly when they made the longest strides towards eliminating prejudice andexpanding their horizonsThe experience of Europe  and increasingly elsewhere  shows that forced cultural dilution and populationreplacement is causing a great deal of fear and insecurity It must be understood that such policies are a verybold form of identitarian politics in reverse The idea that assaulting and destroying cultural geographic andphysical kinship is a fast portal into a rosy globalized utopia appears to be mostly misring and fuelling theresurrection of cultural and racial identitarianism My point is that identitarianism begets identiarianismand that it betrays fundamentally the project of such luminaries as Martin Luther King It is indeedunfortunate that some continue to confuse revenge with justice and enjoy the existential worries of formeroppressors While psychologically easy to understand like all human basic impulses it is hard to see howany rational individual would see such actions as building trust and laying a foundation for a peaceful andharmonious coexistenceThe position that there is no culture worth preserving or protecting unless backed up by a real threat ofsuicide bombing and mass murder   and that ones cultural and physical including geographic coexistence and familiarity with others is an expression of deep held prejudice and bigotry is a profoundassault on that basic mechanism of survival that has been with us since the beginning of time Those whomastermind and plot such assaults know this very well and intent to rapidly and no matter how painfullyreplace an organically developed common identity with an expanded articial one They hope that thetransition would be a fast process of social engineering facilitated by a near complete monopoly on massmedia and education and an intentional weakening of national sovereigntyThe problem with the progressive mindset has always been an unbridled messianism combined with thewillingness to impose hardship on those perceived as retrogrades in the process of rapidly building anutopian future Historically they have mercilessly failed and followed a fully predictable pattern withoutexception 1 they never had the patience to negotiate and wait for an organic evolution towards the desiredgoal 2 they consider those who oppose their project subhuman and morally irredeemable and want themeliminated from the public sphere 3 they adhere to a morality that denies the humanity of those opposingtheir methods and power grab and revert to mob justice social lynching physical lynching and ultimatelythe Gulag 4 have always been eliminated themselves by those more interested in the benets ofconcentrated power than the utopian project itself and 4 once fully formed the resulting dictatorshipsstied everything from economics to culture and decayed into untold misery and social strifeIt is so easy and tempting to believe that a group of people or another is so weakened in their cohesion andcultural heritage that delivering the coup de grace is justied  if nothing else  as an act of mercy Hungryfor power most people play a forceful positioning game in society and are all too willing to exploit alliancesof interest and grievance for dominance This has been so since the beginning of time and will likely bethere forever However it is also true that moral and intellectual leadership and inspiration could be alsogained from those who are not interested in dominance games and remain faithful to values that unite andinspire This is why notable and worthy

of successIf you really care for humanity call an immediate stop on mass social engineering and accelerated processesthat cause people to feel frightened and insecure Reestablish the security that

If You are an American you willstop perceiving the greatness of the most exquisite contribution to constitutional thought and humanprogress and agree with those who want the constitutional foundation of the freest society in historydestroyed Worse of all you will perpetuate a vicious historical cycle instead of helping to stop it The rststep towards a truly better tomorrow is to turn the other cheek and stop dehumanizing those who mistrustyou or do not agree with your project no matter how worthy and illuminated in your estimate Conceivethe possibility of building a better future by negotiating and gaining small steps in the desired direction andavoid and ee those who seek to force humanity to accord with their particular viewpoint Avoid also thosewho seek to build a better

foundation for any lasting human improvement and value does who articulate their trutheven if gravely mistaken above the shrewd ones skillfully hiding their intent To illustrate this with anexample this is why I do not mind white or black supremacists openly voicing their opinion In doing so they invite comment and feedback I also do not mind communist fringe groups writing or demonstratingpeacefully The real problem is with those who silence feedback and silence thought through the exercise ofphysical and political power When a thug dons a mask and carries a baseball bat his or her intention is toend conversation and dominate by power They are the ones who subvert the main achievements of theWestern Civilization and put at risk the future of the most just and free

is no danger of whitesoverrunning africa or asia but the author who isnt white would like white people to sit back and refuse toplay the identity game every other race is playing while THEY still have their homelands which are in nodanger of being overrunMy answer is an resounding NoThanks to Coleman Hughes I read it in a Fb group athttpswwwfacebookcomgroupsPhilosophicalConceptspermalink529966364181933It is very thoughtful I have a slight problem with the race you were born into by chance whichphilosophically seems a little weird but analyzing it here would be o topicI cant help commenting that it reminds me of the joke If your parents didnt have any children thenneither will youfacebookcomwilliamweitzel75201901171329ESTThanks for a wonderful article Very clear and gets at something very importantHow long will using racial pride terms make sense to use for disadvantaged groups That is while generallyspeaking or all things being equal it is easier to be a white man in the US than a black man it is certainlymuch better to be black man today in the US than 100 years ago Which is to say some important progresshas been made So if or to the extent that equality is reached racial pride language will really becometroubling And perhaps racial pride terms are already more of an obstacle to living in the kind of world thatI think we all want to live in namely one in which we judge HUMAN beings on the basis of their moralcharacterAs an aside I nd the dead white guy trope so disappointing Reading older books can help us see thatthere are permanent problems or questions and that easy solutions are oen more tension riddled thanwe think People from the past can say true things or articulate questions and problems that are very muchwith us todayThe Platonic dialogues are absolutely outstanding at showing how unreasonable people can be For instancemost of the interlocutors dont actually admit their own ignorance Like Meno who says Im bewitchedIve made thousands of speeches about virtue He doesnt admit he doesnt know and attributessupernatural capacities to the person who refutes him Or Laches who says that the denition of courage isjust there on the tip of his tongue even though he has been soundly refuted Plato shows us how incrediblyMike

Quillettehttpsquillettecom20190116tiersofprideandshame 4253dicult it is to let go of emotional convictions that we have held for a long time especially if we are proudof them Which is to say dead old white guys can say true things and it has nothing to do with theirwhitenessIf the double standards of the type mentioned by Coleman continue more people will turn to the Titos ofthe world It is not hard to imagine what will happen thenThe only way to prevent this from happening is by doing what Coleman is doing taking a stand forcivilizationColeman is speaking up for lessons hardlearned in the past to avoid ethnic violence we cannot holdpeople of dierent ethnicities to dierent standards The only realistic alternative is by treating others asindividualsIt may be unpleasant to join Coleman and swim upstream of woke dogma but if we do not we will face a farworse fateA great way to instantly be seen as a naf a racist or both is to ask why this double standard exists Theanswer of course is historical context Black people were brought to America in chains forced to work aschattel subjugated formally and informally for a century aer abolition all the while ghting to seethemselves as beautiful in a culture hellbent on convincing them they were ugly stupid and inferior Blackrace pride therefore is a rejection of and an adaptation to the racist elements in Americas reprehensiblepast One cannot make the same claim about white race pride which historically has been more associatedwith brutal oppression than with noble rebellionAh yes so the fact that serfdom in Europe lasted longer than slavery and that unlike slavery in the USAmembers of other races didnt wage wage to liberate them is part of this brutal oppression Those serfs ofcourse were all part of the white race out their brutally oppressing To say nothing of the vast amounts ofEuropean slavery by Africans in the past Or to say nothing of the abolition of Sati the Thuggees humansacrice in Tahiti tribal genocide in New Zealandbut all this is beside the point The point is thatColeman for all that he poses as antiidentitarian is going on here about the white race British USCanadian Indian Nepalese NZ Australia soldiers ridding the world of German and Japanesetyrannyforget that its all about the white race Stu any ne distinctions Saxons vs Daneswhite raceCold war versus Stalinism white race The mix of good

to my mind on a rational view of human natureWhether one feels pride or shame is up to the individual and doesnt necessarily answer to a rationalistanalysis of what emotions should comprise human nature  or what outward representations theseemotions should rightfully rest on  correspond toSpending many hours exploring human nature in a therapeutic setting taught me that the emotions onelogically should feel are oen the leastimportant to what is actually going onAs an example taken from this paper you mention that Frederick Douglass and some other famous blackpeople are or were your heroesIs that rational Does that make senseI think pride is natural and shame is learned or both are natural but one is rstorder natural and the otheris secondorder natural I think love is rst order natural and hatred is learned or second order naturallearned through painful experience Black men of the past are of the same biological ilk and stamp as theirdescendants today and therefore it seems natural to pride oneself on being created by God in that sametemplate  one can reasonably associate with their experiences and accomplishments  and put upononeself the mantle of their glory so to speak The rational calculus of what emotions should be mightdisallow this But I think thats motivated more by the desire to appease a fraught societal consensus hoping if we throw overboard the adolescent seeming gloryseeking of racial identication we can ease theprocess of integration for everyone PerhapsBut the authors mind made an association between himself and Frederick Douglass Why was this easier forhim than say identifying with John Brown the abolitionist The mind is generally not rational I contendAllow me speak with the widest angle lens I have about the issueRaces are ideas in the mind of God They are divine templates that are meant to express the manyfacettednature of the Human beingEach one has special gis and virtues which the other cannot have or create as easily Outside of humanvalue hierarchies all races areequal as we are all in absolute spiritual equality with one another  all souls are created equal In ourexpression both as individualsgroups and races  we are not equal Equal in essence value spirituality and potentiation  but not equal inany of the visible expression metricsupon which human societies generally base themselves Any two human beings even within a family wouldbe unequal on many metricsThese measures we see are our societys perhaps somewhat hamsted attempts to reconcile the spiritualideal of equality  which is truly absolute with the practical reality of peoples dierencesAlso Races are very formidable We are talking about groups of humans These are the most powerfulbeings on the planet and when you address them in their Racial aspect you address their group mind  youtouch one of the most profound primal centers of their being Each one is infused with a profound love ofthe Archetype it represents  though its mind can be

to draw re down on oneself and possibly ones descendantsImagine the alcoholsoaked greed and jollity of the early slave traders who made themselves rich yet thewheels of discontent and anguish they set in motion would redound for hundreds of years  and still areredoundingmake the peasants ght eachother over the skin color  so they never revolt against the elites divide andconquerHave you ever considered the fact that bringing in millions of unwanted dissonant racial strangers is itself adividing act Its not a natural state You sound like a dumb boomer regurgitating something George Carlinsaid in his standup actsConversely the progressive logic that encourages modernday whites to feel shame for slavery andcolonialism should also lead them to feel pride for their ancestors achievementsToo true Endlessly heckling white peiple implicitly gives them permission to defend themselves as  whitepeople and naturally some of them more marginal types will become radicalized In this atmosphereRichard Spencer and white nationalists are as inevitable as Farrakhan and the Black PanthersI suspect thats exactly what is desired by intersectional progressives who primarily dene themselvesopposite of bigotry and clearly desire more if it to further arm themselves and that Charlottesville was theNazi rally they were secretly hoping forJDI agree with this Attacking white people based on their race is causing many of them to begin to defensivelyidentify more and more heavily with their race when they otherwise would not have and I believe this is theprimary driver behind whatever white nationalist or whatever movement is currently on the rise to theextent that it is actually on the rise at all The goal used to be clearly to move beyond judging people basedon race but now it seems that weve started regressing at an alarming rate Its extremely depressing andmakes me want to check out of society altogetherRussia did thisJanuary 18 2019Friedrich GoatseJanuary 18

think you look at the question from the wrong angle when you say you are proud of being white black orx or y or z Like the author says people dont chose before birth to be x y or z and they did not inuencethe past or the glorious or inglorious deeds of the people who came before them I think in the case ofpositive traits or deeds passed down to us the right word is thankful I am a biracial person black white Iam not proud of my ancestors black or white I am thankful to the them I am thankful they not onlyreproduced but they had the fortitude to get up every morning and raise a family despite all the dicultiesThey made me possible At both the family level and the civilizational level the people who came beforeme lived through events that shaped their lives for better or for worse I am the nal distillation of what theyexperienced and how they chose to pass or not pass those experiences on I am thankful My turn now topick up the workPolitical correctness is really getting to ridiculous levels I do not see any problem in people forming groupsto share the things they have in common no matter what they are I am an older person and not white andI just dont see people through the color prism anymore If someone wants to rant about the virtues of beingwhite especially in college let them do so as long as there is nothing vicious or hateful or inciting violenceof any sortHeck I might even stop and listen Im surprised about the focus on skin color in article and comments Though as a social and culturalphenomenon in the US easy to understand On a visit in the US I was amazed to see the denominationCaucasian or black in passports is this still doneThis Caucasian by the way in the original classication has skin color not at all as a distinctive race markneither IQ came much later but more facial and cranial characteristics blacks from the Horn of Africanow Somalians pitch black also belonged to the Caucasian type so quite a dierence with that AmericanCaucasian However the hierarchy in races as preached here by some in the comments was nothing newalso then Caucasian was number one the most perfect and delicate race though at that time more todierentiate them from the ugly and primitive East Asians the Mongoloids the ones with that high IQ rightnow than with the Negroids The times they are achangingI think black pride makes some sense because in some ways blacks in America are more than racial groupbut a semicohesive cultural and social group with a history a religion a literature and a music White pridemakes no sense in that whites are not a semicohesive cultural group As a Jew I take pride as do many Jewsin our Jewish winners of Noble prizes our successful Jewish actors and writers etc Of course Im being a bitsilly since I havent myself

Quillettehttpsquillettecom20190116tiersofprideandshame 4953This was ahold upvery wellargued and profoundly rational article Amazing that such dispassionateanalysis can exist on the internet Stunning that this is the work of an undergraduate writerFantastic writingWhat called my attention was that the writer in sharing his experience of his student days claims not tohave heard more than one instance of racist speech It is very possible that his report is accurate but morelikely it is a reduced understanding of what racism meansAs I understand it Racism is an institutionalized control of access to resources organized around perceivedidentication with a particular race A phenomenon that accompanies this system of privilege is a blindnessto what you take for granted that privilege So I am not surprised that anyone used to conceiving the worldas racist would not see the racism in it and would not notice that specic speech utterances are not the onlyelements that maintain said system of privilegeWhites are racist because the society they built as advanced a von Abele might think it is is based on onlyallowing Whites to control resources It is a system of privilege If you are white you are born with asilver spoon whether you take your socioeconomic class into account or not because the path of leastresistance is for you to have an advantage over someone from another group in the same class standingThe system is not only limited to giving privileges to Whites as based on race it is also skewed to givingprivileges to straight males which is based on another social construct

Elisha Elijah John the Baptist Buddha Mahavira Lao Tsu and other spiritual masters from all overthe worldThe only way to end racism is for us to increase our observation understanding and control over our ownbrain and nervous systems Increasing our own mental health broadly dened and our own deepintelligence where general intelligence is a subset within the superset of deep intelligence Many ancienttraditions unlock this through what is sometimes called love Deeply misunderstood though this term isHuman beings are inherently and potentially wiser and more powerful than our grandest dreams To implyotherwise is racismStructures institutionalized control of access to resources organized around perceived identication with aparticular race systems of privilege socioeconomic class social constructs gender are all tiny specs of dustcompared the blazing ery star of human potentialOne of the reasons this human potential is locked is a European post modernist marxist conspiracy tocolonize

civilizations and cultures around the world deeply revere respect and honor their elders andancestors Why is this wrongI would dispute the idea that there is such a thing as whiteness at all There is such a thing as culture andsubculture Culture is dierent from race Many authentically identify with many cultures simultaneouslymyself included There is such a thing as American culture English culture French culture Spanish cultureGerman culture and so on The concept of European civilization strikes me as deeply amorphousimprecise multimodal and non descriptive White culture and civilization far more so than theEuropean handleFor this reason taking pride in the achievements of ancient whites makes little sense But taking pride inthe accomplishment of ancient Romans Gauls Germanics English Greeks Greek Turks Anatolia wasculturally greek for thousands of years Serbs is not wrong Taking pride in whiteness strikes me asbizarre and meaninglessWe can honor our ancestors long gone without constantly condemning their mistakes Feeling guilt over theactions of ancestors long gone makes no sense Why cant we feel gratitude respect and pride without guiltYou are right that the greatness of our ancestors is their greatness not ours We need this humility alongsiderespecting our ancestorsLong have I pondered how and why it is that perceived humanity leaves race in the dust

1  Madame Rose HaniePart OneMiserable is the man who loves a woman and takes her for a wife pouring at her feet the sweat of his skin and the blood of his bodyand the life of his heart and placing in her hands the fruit of his toil and the revenue of hi s diligence for when he slowly wakes uphe finds that the heart which he endeavoured to buy is given freely and in sincerity to another man for the enjoyment of its hiddensecrets and deepest love Miserable is the woman who arises from the inattenti veness and restlessness of youth and finds herself inthe home of a man showering her with his glittering gold and precious gifts and according her all the honors and grace of lavishentertainment but unable to satisfy her soul with the heavenly wine whic h God pours from the eyes of a man into the heart of awomanI knew Rashid Bey Namaan since I was a youngster he was a Lebanese born and reared in the City of Beyrouth Being a member ofan old and rich family which preserved the tradition and glory of his ancestry Rashid was fond of citing incidents that dealt mainlywith the nobility of his forefathers In his routine life he followed their beliefs and customs which at that time prevailed in theMiddle EastRashid Bey Namaan was generous and goodhearted but like many of the Syrians looked only at the superficial things instead ofreality He never hearkened to the dictates of his heart but busied himself in obeying the voices of his environment H e amusedhimself with shimmering objects that blinded his eyes and heart to lifes secrets his soul was diverted away from an understandingof the law of nature and to a temporary selfgratification He was one of those men who hastened to confess thei r love or disgust tothe people then regretted their impulsiveness when it was too late for recall And then shame and ridicule befell them instead ofpardon or sanctionThese are the characteristics that prompted Rashid Bey Namaan to marry Rose Hanie far before her soul emraced his soul in theshadow of the true love that makes union a paradiseAfter a few years of absence I returned to the City of Beyrouth As I went to visit Rashid Bey Namaan I found him pale and thin Onhis face one could see the spectre of bitter disappointment his sorrowful eyes bespoke his crushed heart and melan choly soul I wascurious to find the cause for his miserable plight however I did not hesitate to ask for explanation and said What became of youRashid Where is the radiant smile and the happy countenance that accompanied you since childhood H as death taken away fromyou a dear friend Or have the black nights stolen from you the gold you have amassed during the white days In the name offriendship tell me what is causing this sadness of heart and weakness of bodyHe looked at me ruefully as if I had revived to him some secluded images of beautiful days With a distressed and faltering voice heresponded When a person loses a friend he consoles himself with the many other friends about him and if he loses his gold hemeditates for a while and casts misfortune from his mind especially when he finds himself healthy and still laden with ambition Butwhen a man loses the ease of his heart where can he find comfort and with what can he replace it What mind can master it Whendeath strikes close by you will suffer But when the day and the night pass you will feel the smooth touch of the soft fingers of Lifethen you will smile and rejoice7192020 Spirits Rebellious by Khalil GibrannewthoughtlibrarycomgibranKhalilspiritsRebellious 211Destiny comes suddenly bringing concern she stares at you with horrible eyes and clutches you at the throat with sharp fingers andhurls you to the ground and tramples upon you with ironclad feet then she laughs and walks away but later regrets h er actions andasks you through good fortune to forgive her She stretches her silky hand and lifts you high and sings to you the Song of Hope andcauses you to lose your cares She creates in you a new zest for confidence and ambition If your lot in life is a beautiful bird that youlove dearly you gladly feed to him the seeds of your inner self and make your heart his cage and your soul his nest But while you areaffectionately admiring him and looking upon him with the eyes of love he escapes from your hands and flies very high then hedescends and enters into another cage and never comes back to you What can you do Where can you find patience and condolenceHow can you revive your hopes and dreams What power can still your turbulent heartHaving uttered these words with a choking voice and suffering spirit Rashid Bey Namaan stood shaking like a reed between thenorth and south wind He extended his hands as if to grasp something with his bent fingers and destroy it His wrinkled fac e waslivid his eyes grew larger as he stared a few moments and it seemed to him as if he saw a demon appearing from nonexistence totake him away then he fixed his eyes on mine and his appearance suddenly changed his anger was converted into keen suf feringand distress and he cried out saying It is the woman whom I rescued from between the deathly paws of poverty I opened mycoffers to her and made her envied by all women for the beautiful raiment and precious gems and magnificent carriages drawn byspirited horses the woman whom my heart has loved and at whose feet I poured affection the woman to whom I was a true friendsincere companion and a faithful husband The woman who betrayed me and departed me for another man to share with him destitution and partake his evil bread kneaded with shame and mixed with disgrace The woman I loved the beautiful bird whom I fedand to whom I made my heart a cage and my soul a nest has escaped from my hands and entered into another cage that pure an gelwho resided in the paradise of my affection and love now appears to me as a horrible demon descended into the darkness to sufferfor her sin and cause me to suffer on earth for her crimeHe hid his face with his hands as if wanting to protect himself from himself and became silent for a moment Then he sighed andsaid This is all I can tell you please do not ask anything further Do not make a crying voice of my calamity but le t it rather bemute misfortune perhaps it will grow in silence and deaden me away so that I may rest at last with peaceI rose with tears in my eyes and mercy in my heart and silently bade him goodbye my words had no power to console his woundedheart and my knowledge had no torch to illuminate his gloomy selfPart TwoA few days thereafter I met Madame Rose Hanie for the first time in a poor hovel surrounded by flowers and trees She had heard ofme through Rashid Bey Namaan the man whose heart she had crushed and stamped upon and left under the terrible hoofs of LifeAs I looked at her beautiful bright eyes and heard her sincere voice I said to myself Can this be the sordid woman Can this clearface hide an ugly soul and a criminal heart Is this the unfaithful wife Is this the woman of whom I have spoken evil and imaginedas a serpent disguised in the form of a beautiful bird Then I whispered again to myself saying Is it this beautiful face that madeRashid Bey Namaan miserable Havent we heard that obvious beauty is the cause of many hidden distresses and deep suffering Isnot the beautiful moon that inspires the poets the same moon that angers the silence of the sea with a terrible roarAs we seated ourselves Madame Rose Hanie seemed to have heard and read my thoughts and wanted not to prolong my doubts Sheleaned her beautiful head upon her hands and with a voice sweeter than the sound of the lyre she said I have never met you but Iheard the echoes of your thoughts and dreams from the mouths of the people and they convinced me that you are merciful and haveunderstanding for the oppressed woman  the woman whose hearts secrets you have discovered and whose affections you haveknown Allow me to reveal to you the full contents of my heart so you may know that Rose Hanie never was an unfaithful womanI was scarcely eighteen years of age when fate led me to Rashid Bey Namaan who was then forty years old He fell in love with meaccording to what the people say and took me for a wife and put me in his magnificent home placing at my disposal clothes andprecious gems He exhibited me as a strange rarity at the homes of his friends and family he smiled with triumph when he saw hiscontemporaries looking at me with surprise and admiration he lifted his chin high with pride when he heard the ladies speak of mewith praise and affection But never could he hear the whispers Is this the wife of Rashid Bey Namaan or his adopted daughterAnd another one commenting If he had married at the proper age his first born would have been older than Rose HanieAll that happened before my life had awakened from the deep swoon of youth and before God inflamed my heart with the torch oflove and before the growth of the seeds of my affections Yes all this transpired during the time when I believed that real happinesscame through beautiful clothes and magnificent mansions When I woke up from the slumber of childhood I felt the flames of sacredfire burning in my heart and a spiritual hunger gnawing at my soul making it suffer When I opened my eyes I found my wingsmoving to the right and left trying to ascend into the spacious firmament of love but shivering and dropping under the gusts of theshackles of laws that bound my body to a man before I knew the true meaning of that law I felt all these things and knew that awomans happiness does not come through mans glory and honour nor through his generosity and affection but through love thatunites both of their hearts and affections making them one member of lifes body and one word upon the lips of God When Truthshowed herself to me I found myself imprisoned by law in the mansion of Rashid Bey Namaan like a thief stealing his bread andhiding in the dark and friendly corners of the night I knew that every hour spent with him was a terrible lie written upon myforehead with letters of fire before heaven and earth I could not give him my love and affection in reward for his generosity andsincerity I tried in vain to love him but love is a power that makes our hearts yet our hearts cannot make that power I prayed andprayed in the silence of the night before God to create in the depths of my heart a spiritual attachment that would carry me closer tothe man who had been chosen for me as a companion through lifeMy prayers were not granted because Love descends upon our souls by the will of God and not by the demand or the plea of theindividual Thus I remained for two years in the home of that man envying the birds of the field their freedom while my friends7192020 Spirits Rebellious by Khalil GibrannewthoughtlibrarycomgibranKhalilspiritsRebellious 311envied me my painful chains of gold I was like a woman who is torn from her only child like a lamenting heart existing withoutattachment like an innocent victim of the severity of human law I was close to death from spiritual thirst and hungerOne dark day as I looked behind the heavy skies I saw a gentle light pouring from the eyes of a man who was walking forlornly onthe path of life I closed my eyes to that light and said to myself Oh my soul darkness of the grave is thy lot do not be greedy for thelight Then I heard a beautiful melody from heaven that revived my wounded heart with its purity but I closed my ears and saidOh my soul the cry of the abyss is thy lot do not be greedy for heavenly songs I closed my eyes again so I could not see and shutmy ears so I could not hear but my closed eyes still saw that gentle light and my ears still heard that divine sound I was frightenedfor the first time and felt like the beggar who found a precious jewel near the Emirs palace and could not pick it up on account offear or leave it because of poverty I cried  a cry of a thirsty soul who sees a brook surrounded by wild beasts and falls upon theground waiting and watching fearfullyThen she turned her eyes away from me as if she remembered the past that made her ashamed to face me but she continued Thosepeople who go to back to eternity before they taste the sweetness of real life are unable to understand the meaning of a womanssuffering Especially when she devotes her soul to a man she loves by the will of God and her body to another whom she caresses bythe enforcement of earthly law It is a tragedy written with the blood of the womans blood and tears which the man reads withridicule because he cannot understand it yet if he does understand his laughter will turn into scorn and blasphemy that act like fireupon her heart It is a drama enacted by the black nights upon the stage of a womans soul whose body is tied up into a man knownto her as husband ere she perceives Gods meaning of marriage She finds her soul hovering about the man whom she adores by allagencies of pure and true love and beauty It is a terrible agony that began with the existence of weakness in a woman and thecommencement of strength in a man It will not end unless the days of slavery and superiority of the strong over the weak areabolished It is a horrible war between the corrupt law of humanity and the sacred affections and holy purpose of the heart In such abattlefield I was lying yesterday but I gathered the remnants of my strength and unchained my irons of cowardice and untied mywings from the swaddles of weakness and arose into the spacious sky of love and freedomToday I am one with the man I love he and I sprang out as one torch from the hand of God before the beginning of the world Thereis no power under the sun that can take my happiness from me because it emanated from two embraced spirits engulfed byunderstanding radiated by Love and protected by heavenShe looked at me as if she wanted to penetrate my heart with her eyes in order to to discover the impression of her words upon meand to hear the echo of her voice from within me but I remained silent and she continued Her voice was full of bitterness ofmemory and sweetness of sincerity and freedom when she said The people will tell you that Rose Hanie is an heretic and unfaithfulwoman who followed her desires by leaving the man who elated her into him and made her the elegance of his home They will tellyou that she is an adulteress and prostitute who destroyed with her filthy hands the wreath of a sacred marriage and replaced it witha besmirched union woven of the thorns of hell She took off the garment of virtue and put on the cloak of sin and disgrace They willtell you more than that because the ghosts of their fathers are still living in their bodies They are like the deserted caves of themountains that echo voices whose meanings are not understood They neither understand the law of God nor comprehend the trueintent of veritable religion nor distinguish between a sinner and an innocent They look only at the surface of objects withoutknowing their secrets They pass their verdicts with ignorance and judge with blindness making the criminal and the innocent thegood and the bad equal Woe to those who prosecute and judge the people   In Gods eyes I was unfaithful and an adulteress only while at the home of Rashid Bey Namaan because he made me his wifeaccording to the customs and traditions and by the force of haste before heaven had made him mine in conformity with the spirituallaw of Love and Affection I was a sinner in the eyes of God and myself when I ate his bread and offered him my body in reward forhis generosity Now I am pure and clean because the law of Love has freed me and made me honourable and faithful I ceased sellingmy body for shelter and my days for clothes Yes I was an adulteress and a criminal when the people viewed me as the mosthonourable and faithful wife today I am pure and noble in spirit but in their opinion I am polluted for they judge the soul by theoutcome of the body and measure the spirit by the standard of matterThen she looked through the window and pointed out with her right hand toward the city as if she had seen the ghost of corruptionand the shadow of shame among its magnificent buildings She said pityingly Look at those majestic mansions and sublime palaceswhere hypocrisy resides in those edifices and between their beautifully decorated walls resides Treason beside Putridity under theceiling painted with melted gold lives Falsehood beside Pretension Notice those gorgeous homes that represent happiness glory anddomination they are naught but caverns of misery and distress They are plastered graves in which Treason of the weak womanhides behind her kohled eyes and crimsoned lips in their corners selfishness exists and the animality of man through his gold andsilver rules supremeIf those high and impregnable buildings scented the odor of hatred deceit and corruption they would have cracked and fallen Thepoor villager looks upon those residences with tearful eyes but when he finds that the hearts of the occupants are empty of that purelove that exists in the heart of his wife and fills its domain he will smile and go back to his fields contentedAnd then she took hold of my hand and led me to the side of the window and said Come I will show you the unveiled secrets ofthose people whose path I refused to follow Look at that palace with giant columns IN it lives a rich man who inherited his goldfrom his father After having led a life of filth and putrefaction he married a woman about whom he knew nothing except that herfather was one of the Sultans dignitaries As soon as the wedding trip was over he became disgusted and commenced associationswith women who sell their bodies for pieces of silver His wife was left alone in that palace like an empty bottle left by a drunkardShe cried and suffered for the first time then she realized that her tears were more precious than her degenerate husband Now sheis busying herself in the love and devotion of a young man upon whom she showers her joyous hours and into whose heart she poursher sincere love and affection7192020 Spirits Rebellious by Khalil GibrannewthoughtlibrarycomgibranKhalilspiritsRebellious 411Let me take you now to that gorgeous home surrounded by beautiful gardens It is the home of a man who comes from a noblefamily which ruled the country for many generations but whose standards wealth and prestige have declined due to theirindulgence in mad spending and slothfulness A few years ago this man married an ugly but rich woman After he acquired herfortune he ignored her completely and commenced devoting himself to an attractive young woman His wife today is devoting hertime to curling her hair painting her lips and perfuming her body She wears the most expensive clothes and hopes that some youngman will smile and come to visit her but it is all in vain for she cannot succeed except in receiving a smile from her ugly self in themirrorObserve that big manor encircled with the marble statuary it is the home of a beautiful woman who posseses strange characterWhen her first husband died she inherited all his money and estate then she selected a man with a weak mind and feeble body andbecame his wife to protect herself from the evil tongues and to use him as a shield for her abominations She is now among heradmirers like a bee that sucks the sweetest and most delicious flowersThat beautiful home next to it was built by the greatest architect in the province it belongs to a greedy and substantial man whodevotes all of his time to amassing gold and grinding the faces of the poor He has a wife of supernatural beauty bodily andspiritually but she is like the rest a victim of early marriage Her father committed a crime by giving her away to a man before sheattained understanding age placing on her neck the heavy yoke of corrupt marriage She is thin and pale now and cannot find anoutlet for her imprisoned affection She is sinking slowly and craving for death to free her from the mesh of slavery and deliver herfrom a man who spends his life gathering gold and cursing the hour he married a barren woman who could not bring him a child tocarry on his name and inherit his moneyIn that home among the orchards lives an ideal poet he married an ignorant woman who ridicules his works because she cannotunderstand them and laughs at his conduct because she cannot adjust herself to his sublime way of life That poet found freedomfrom despair in his love for a married woman who appreciates his intelligence and inspires him by kindling in his heart the torch ofaffections and revealing to him the most beautiful and eternal sayings by means of her charm and beautySilence prevailed for a few moments and Madame Hanie seated herself on a sofa by the window as if her soul were tired of roamingthose quarters Then she slowly continued These are the residences in which I refused to live these are the graves in which I toowas spiritually buried These people from whom I have freed myself are the ones who become attracted by the body and repelled bythe spirit and who know naught of Love and Beauty The only mediator between them and God is Gods pity for their ignorance ofthe law of God I cannot judge for I was one of them but I sympathize with all my heart I do not hate them but I hate theirsurrender to weakness and falsehood I have said all these things to show you the reality of the people from whom I have escapedagainst their will I was trying to explain to you the life of persons who speak every evil against me because I have lost theirfriendship and finally gained my own I emerged from their dark dungeon and directed my eyes towards the light where sinceritytruth and justice prevail They have exiled me now from their society and I am pleased because humanity does not exile except theone whose noble spirit rebels against despotism and oppression He who does not prefer exile to slavery is not free by any measure offreedom truth and dutyYesterday I was like a tray containing all kinds of palatable foods and Rashid Bey Namaan never approached me unless he felt aneed for that food yet both of our souls remained far apart from us like two humble dignified servants I have tried to reconcilemyself to what people call misfortune but my spirit refused to spend all its life kneeling with me before a horrible idol erected by thedark ages and called LAW I kept my chains until I heard Love calling me and saw my spirit preparing to embark Then I broke themand walked out from Rashid Bey Namaans home like a bird freed from his iron cage and leaving behind me all the gems clothes andservants I came to live with my beloved for I knew that what I was doing was honest Heaven does not want me to weep and sufferMany times at night I prayed for dawn to come and when dawn came I prayed for the day to be over God does not want me to lead amiserable life for He placed in the depths of my heart a desire for happiness His glory rests in the happiness of my heartThis is my story and this is my protest before heaven and earth this is what I sing and repeat while people are closing their ears forfear of hearing me and leading their spirits into rebellion that would crumble the foundation of their quavering societyThis is the rough pathway I have carved until I reached the mountain peak of my happiness Now if death comes to take me away Iwill be more than willing to offer myself before the Supreme Throne of Heaven without fear or shame I am ready for the day ofjudgment and my heart is white as the snow I have obeyed the will of God in everything I have done and followed the call of myheart while listening to the angelic voice of heaven This is my drama which the people of Beyrouth call A curse upon the lips of lifeand An ailment in the body of society But one day love will arouse their hearts like the sun rays that bring forth the flowers evenfrom contaminated earth One day the wayfarers will stop by my grave and greet the earth that enfolds my body and say Here liesRose Hanie who freed herself from the slavery of decayed human laws in order to comply with Gods law of pure love She turned herface toward the sun so she would not see the shadow of her body amongst the skulls and thorns  The door opened and a man entered His eyes were shining with magic rays and upon his lips appeared a wholesome smile MadameHanie rose took the young mans arm and introduced him to me then gave him my name with flattering words I knew that he wasthe one for whose sake she denied the whole world and violated all earthly laws and customsAs we sat down silence controlled Each one of us was engrossed in deep thought One minute worthy of silence and respect hadpassed when I looked at the couple sitting side by side I saw something I had never seen before and realized instantly the meaningof Madame Hanies story I comprehended the secret of her protest against the society which persecutes those who rebel against7192020 Spirits Rebellious by Khalil GibrannewthoughtlibrarycomgibranKhalilspiritsRebellious 511confining laws and customs before determining the cause for the rebellion I saw one heavenly spirit before me composed of twobeautiful and united persons in the midst of which stood the god of Love stretching his wings over them to protect them from eviltongues I found a complete understanding emanating from two smiling faces illuminated by sincerity and surrounded by virtue Forthe first time in my life I found the phantom of happiness standing between a man and a woman cursed by religion and opposed bythe law I rose and bade them goodbye and left that poor hovel which Affection had erected as an altar to Love and Understanding Iwalked past the buildings which Madame Hanie pointed out to me As I reached the end of these quarters I remembered Rashid BeyNamaan and meditated his miserable plight and said to myself He is oppressed will heaven ever listen to him if he complainsabout Madame Hanie Had that woman done wrong when she left him and followed the freedom of her heart Or did he commit acrime by subduing her heart into love Which of the two is the oppressed and which is the oppressor Who is the criminal and who isthe innocentThen I resumed talking to myself after a few moments of deep thinking Many times deception had tempted woman to leave herhusband and follow wealth because her love for riches and beautiful raiment blinds her and leads her into shame Was MadameHanie deceitful when she left her rich husbands palace for a poor mans hut Many times igorance kills a womans honour andrevives her passion she grows tired and leaves her husband prompted by her desires and follows a man to whom she lowers herselfWas Madame Hanie an ignorant woman following her physical desires when she declared publicly her independence and joined herbeloved young man She could have satisfied herself secretly while at her husbands home for many men were willing to be theslaves of her beauty and martyrs of her love Madame Hanie was a miserable woman She sought only happiness found it andembraced it This is the very truth which society disrespects Then I whispered through the ether and inquired of myself Is itpermissible for a woman to buy her happiness with her husbands misery And my soul added Is it lawful for a man to enslave hiswifes affection when he realizes he will never possess it I continued walking and Madame Hanies voice was still sounding in my ears when I reached the extreme end of the city The sunwas disappearing and silence ruled the fields and prairies while the birds commenced singing their evening prayers I stood theremeditating and then I sighed and said Before the throne of Freedom the trees rejoice with the frolicsome breeze and enjoy the raysof the sun and the beams of the moon Through the ears of Freedom these birds whisper and around Freedom they flutter to themusic of the brooks Throughout the sky of Freedom these flowers breathe their fragrance and before Freedoms eyes they smilewhen day comesEverything lives on earth according to the law of nature and from that law emerges the glory and joy of liberty but man is deniedthis fortune because he set for the Godgiven soul a limited and earthly law of his own He made for himself strict rules Man built anarrow and painful prison in which he secluded his affections and desires He dug out a deep grave in which he buried his heart andits purpose If an individual through the dictates of his soul declares his withdrawal from society and violates the law his fellowmenwill say he is a rebel worthy of exile or an infamous creature worthy only of execution Will man remain a slave of selfconfinementuntil the end of the world Or will he be freed by the passing of time and live in the Spirit for the Spirit Will man insist upon staringdownward and backward at the earth Or will he turn his eyes toward the sun so he will not see the shadow of his body amongst theskulls and thornsReturn to the Top Return to the TopChapter 2  The Cry of the GravesPart OneThe Emir walked into the court room and took the central chair while at his right and left sat the wise men of the country Theguards armed with swords and spears stood in attention and the people who came to witness the trial rose and bowedceremoniously to the Emir whose eyes emanated a power that revealed horror to their spirits and fear to their hearts As the courtcame to order and the hour of judgment approached the Emir raised his hand and shouted saying Bring forth the criminals singlyand tell me what crimes they have committed The prison door opened like the mouth of a ferocious yawning beast In the obscurecorners of the dungeon one could hear the echo of shackles rattling in unison with the moaning and lamentations of the prisonersThe spectators were eager to see the prey of Death emerging from the depths of that inferno A few moments later two soldiers cameout leading a young man with his arms pinioned behind his back His stern face bespoke nobility of spirit and strength of the heartHe was halted in the middle of the court room and the soldiers marched a few steps to the rear The Emir stared at him steadily andsaid What crime has this man who is proudly and triumphantly standing before me committed One of the courtmen respondedHe is a murderer yesterday he slew one of the Emirs officers who was on an important mission in the surrounding villages he wasstill grasping the bloody sword when he was arrested The Emir retorted with anger Return the man to the dark prison and tie himwith heavy chains and at dawn cut off his head with his own sword and throw his body in the woods so that the beasts may eat theflesh and the air may carry its remindful odor into the noses of his family and friends The youth was returned to prison while thepeople looked upon him with sorroful eyes for he was a young man in the spring of lifeThe soldiers returned back again from the prison leading a young woman of natural and frail beauty She looked pale and upon herface appeared the signs of oppression and disappointment Her eyes were soaked with tears and her head was bent under the burden7192020 Spirits Rebellious by Khalil GibrannewthoughtlibrarycomgibranKhalilspiritsRebellious 611of grief After eyeing her thoroughly the Emir exclaimed And this emaciated woman who is standing before me like the shadowbeside a corpse what has she done One of the soldiers answered him saying She is an adulteress last night her husbanddiscovered her in the arms of another After her lover excaped her husband turned her over to the law The Emir looked at herwhile she raised her face without expression and he ordered Take her back to the dark room and stretch her upon a bed of thornsso she may remember the resting place which she polluted with her fault give her vinegar mixed with gall to drink so she mayremember the taste of those sweet kisses At dawn drag her naked body outside the city and stone her Let the wolves enjoy thetender meat of her body and the worms pierce her bones AS she walked back to the dark cell the people looked upon her withsympathy and surprise They were astonished with the Emirs justice and grieved over her fate The soldiers reappeared bringingwith them a sad man with shaking knees and trembling like a tender sapling before the north wind He looked powerless sickly andfrightened and he was miserable and poor The Emir stared at him loathfully and inquired And this filthy man who is like deadamongst the living what has he done One of the guards returned He is a thief who broke into the monastery and stole the sacredvases which the priests found under his garment when they arrested himAs a hungry eagle who looks at a bird with broken wings the Emir looked at him and said Take him back to the jail and chain himand at dawn drag him into a lofty tree and hang him between heaven and earth so his sinful hands may perish and the members ofhis body may be turned into particles and scattered by the wind As the thief stimbled back into the depths of the prison the peoplecommenced whispering one to another saying How dare such a weak and heretic man steal the sacred vases of the monasteryAt this time the court adjourned and the Emir walked out accompanied by all his wise men guarded by the soldiers while theaudience scattered and the place became empty except of the moaning and wailing of the prisoners All this happened while I wasstanding there like a mirror before passing ghosts I was meditating the laws made by man for man contemplating what the peoplecall justice and engrossing myself with deep thoughts of the secrets of life I tried to understand the meaning of the universe I wasdumbfounded in finding myself lost like a horizon that disappears beyond the cloud As I left the place I said to myself Thevegetable feeds upon the elements of the earth the sheep eats the vegetable the wolf preys upon the sheep and the bull kills the wolfwhile the lion devours the bull yet Death claims the lion Is there any power that will overcome Death and make these brutalities aneternal justice Is there a force that can convert all the ugly things into beautiful objects Is there any might that can clutch with itshands all the elements of life and embrace them with joy as the sea joyfully engulfs all the brooks into its depths Is there any powerthat can arrest the murdered and the murderer the adulteress and the adulterer the robber and the robbed and bring them to acourt loftier and more supreme than the court of the EmirThe Cry of the GravesPart TwoThe next day I left the city for the fields where silence reveals to the soul that which the spirit desires and where the pure sky kills thegerms of despair nursed in the city by the narrow streets and obscured places When I reached the valley I saw a flock of crows andvultures soaring and descending filling the sky with cawing whistling and rustling of the wings As I proceeded I saw before me acorpse of a man hanged high in a tree the body of a dead naked woman in the midst of a heap of stones and a carcass of a youth withhis head cut off and soaked with blood mixed with earth It was a horrible sight that blinded my eyes with a thick dark veil ofsorrows I looked in every direction and saw naught except the spectre of Death standing by those ghastly remains Nothing could beheard except the wailing of nonexistence mingled with the cawing of crows hovering about the victims of human laws Threehuman beings who yesterday were in the lap of Life today fell as victims to Death because they broke the rules of human societyWhen a man kills another man the people say he is a murderer but when the Emir kills him the Emir is just When a man robs amonastery they say he is a thief but when the Emir robs him of his life the Emir is honourable When a woman betrays herhusband they say she is an adulteress but when the Emir makes her walk naked in the streets and stones her later the Emir isnoble Shedding of blood is forbidden but who made it lawful for the Emir Stealing ones money is a crime but taking away oneslife is a noble act Betrayal of a husband may be an ugly deed but stoning of living souls is a beautiful sight Shall we meet evil withevil and say this is the Law Shall we fight corruption with greater corruption and say this is the Rule Shall we conquer crimes withmore crimes and say this is Justice Had not the Emir killed an enemy in his past life Had he not robbed his weak subjects of moneyand property Had he not committed adultery Was he infallible when he killed the murderer and hanged the thief in the tree Whoare those who hanged the thief in the tree Are they angels descended from heaven or men looting and usurping Who cut off themurderers head Are they divine prophets or soldiers shedding blood wherever they go Who stoned that adulteress Were theyvirtuous hermits who came from their monasteries or humans who loved to commit atrocities with glee under the protection ofignorant Law What is Law Who saw it coming with the sun from the depths of heaven What human saw the heart of God andfound its will or purpose In what century did the angels walk among the people and preach to them saying Forbid the weak fromenjoying life and kill the outlaws with the sharp edge of the sword and step upon the sinners with iron feetAs my mind suffered in this fashion I heard a rustling of feet in the grass close by I took heed and saw a young woman coming frombehind the trees she looked carefully in every direction before she approached the three carcasses that were there As she glancedshe saw the youths head that was cut off She cried fearfully knelt and embraced it with her termbling arms then she commencedshedding tears and touching the bloodmatted curly hair with her soft fingers crying in a voice that came from the remnants of ashattered heart She could bear the sight no longer She dragged the body to a ditch and placed the head gently between theshoulders covered the entire body with earth and upon the grave she planted the sword with which the head of the young man hadbeen cut offAs she started to leave I walked toward her She trembled when she saw me and her eyes were heavy with tears She sighed andsaid Turn me over to the Emir if you wish It is better for me to die and follow the one who saved my life from the grip of disgracethan to leave his corpse as food for the ferrocious beasts Then I responded Fear me not poor girl I have lamented the young manbefore you did But tell me how did he save you from the grip of disgrace She replied with a choking and fainting voice One of theEmirs officers came to our farm to collect the tax when he saw me he looked upon me as a wolf looks upon a lamb He imposed on7192020 Spirits Rebellious by Khalil GibrannewthoughtlibrarycomgibranKhalilspiritsRebellious 711my father a heavy tax that even a rich man could not pay He arrested me as a token to take to the Emir in ransom for the gold whichmy father was unable to give I begged him to spare me but he took no heed for he had no mercy Then I cried for help and thisyoung man who is dead now came for my help and saved me from a living death The officer attempted to kill him but this mantook an old sword that was hanging on the wall of our home and stabbed him He did not run away like a criminal but stood by thedead officer until the law came and took him into custody Having uttered these words which would make any human heart bleedwith sorrow she turned her face and walked awayIn a few moments I saw a youth coming and hiding his face with a cloak As he approached the corpse of the adulteress he took offthe garment and placed it upon her naked body Then he drew a dagger from under the cloak and dug a pit in which he placed thedead girl with tenderness and care and covered her with earth upon which he poured his tears When he finished his task heplucked some flowers and placed them reverently upon the grave As he started to leave I halted him saying What kin are you tothis adulteress And what prompted you to endanger your life by coming here to protect her naked body from the ferrocious beastsWhen he stared at me his sorrowful eyes bespoke his misery and he said I am the unfortunate man for whose love she was stonedI loved her and she loved me since childhood we grew together Love whom we served and revered was the lord of our hearts Lovejoined both of us and embraced our souls One day I absented myself from the city and upon my return I discovered that her fatherobliged her to marry a man she did not love My life became a perpetual struggle and all my days were converted into one long anddark night I tried to be at peace with my heart but my heart would not be still Finally I went to see her secretly and my sole purposewas to have a glimpse of her beautiful eyes and hear the sound of her serene voice When I reached her house I found her lonelylamenting her unfortunate self I sat by her silence was our important conversation and virtue our companion One hour ofunderstanding quiet passed when her husband entered I cautioned him to contain himself but he dragged her with both hands intothe street and cried out saying Come come and see the adulteress and her lover All the neighbours rushed about and later the lawcame and took her to the Emir but I was not touched by the soldiers The ignorant Law and sodden customs punished the womanfor her fathers fault and pardoned the manHaving thus spoken the man turned toward the city while I remained pondering the corpse of the thief hanging in that lofty tree andmoving slightly every time the wind shook the branches waiting for someone to bring him down and stretch him upon the bosom ofthe earth beside the Defender of Honour and Martyr of Love An hour later a frail and wretched woman appeared crying She stoodbefore the hanged man and prayed reverently Then she struggled up into the tree and gnawed with her teeth on the linen rope untilit broke and the dead fell on the ground like a huge wet cloth whereupon she came down dug a grave and buried the thief by theside of the other two victims After covering him with earth she took two pieces of wood and fashioned a cross and placed it over thehead When she turned her face to the city and started to depart I stopped her saying What incited you to come and bury thisthief She looked at me miserably and said He is my faithful husband and merciful companion he is the father of my children five young ones starving to death the oldest is eight years of age and the youngest is still nursing My husband was not a thief but afarmer working in the monasterys land making our living on what little food the priests and monks gave him when he returnedhome at eventide He had been farming for them since he was young and when he became weak they dismissed him advising himto go back home and send his children to take his place as soon as they grew older He begged them in the name of Jesus and theangels of heaven to let him stay but they took no heed of his plea They had no mercy on him nor on his starving children who werehelplessly crying for food He went to the city seeking employment but in vain for the rich did not employ except the strong and thehealthy Then he sat on the dusty street stretching his hand toward all who passed begging and repeating the sad song of his defeatin life while suffering from hunger and humiliation but the people refused to help him saying that lazy people did not deserve almsOn night hunger gnawed painfully at our children especially the youngest who tried hopelessly to nurse on my dry breast Myhusbands expression changed and he left the house under the cover of the night He entered the monasterys bin and carried out abushel of wheat As he emerged the monks woke up from their slumber and arrested him after beating him mercilessly At dawnthey brought him to the Emir and complained that he came to the monastery to steal the golden vases of the altar He was placed inprison and hanged the second day He was trying to fill the stomachs of his little hungry one with the wheat he had raised by his ownlabour but the Emir killed him and used his flesh as food to fill the stomachs of the birds and the beasts Having spoken in thismanner she left me alone in a sorrowful plight and departedI stood there before the graves like a speaker suffering wordlessness while trying to recite a eulogy I was speechless but my fallingtears substitute for my words and spoke for my soul My spirit rebelled when I attempted to meditate a while because the soul is likea flower that folds its petals when dark comes and breathes not its fragrance into the phantoms of the night I felt as if the earth thatenfolded the victims of oppression in that lonely place were filling my ears with sorrowful tunes of suffering souls and inspiring meto talk I resorted to silence but if the people understood what silence reveals to them they would have been as close to God as theflowers of the valleys If the flames of my sighing soul had touched the trees they would have moved from their places and marchedlike a strong army to fight the Emir with their branches and tear down the monastery upon the heads of those priests and monks Istood there watching and felt that the sweet feeling of mercy and the bitterness of sorrow were pouring from my heart upon thenewly dug graves  a grave of a young man who sacrificed his life in defending a weak maiden whose life and honour he had savedfrom between the paws and teeth of a savage human a youth whose head was cut off in reward for his bravery and his sword wasplanted upon his grave by the one he saved as a symbol of heroism before the face of the sun that shines upon an empire laden withstupidity and corruption A grave of a young woman whose heart was inflamed with love before her body was taken by greedusurped by lust and stoned by tyranny    She kept her faith until death her lover placed flowers upon her grave to speak throughtheir withering hours of those souls whom Love had selected and blessed among a people blinded by earthly substance and muted byignorance A grave of a miserable man weakened by hard labour in the monasterys land who asked for bread to feed his hungrylittle ones and was refused He resorted to begging but the people took no heed When his soul led him to restore a small part of thecrop which he had raised and gathered he was arrested and beaten to death His poor widow erected a cross upon his head as awitness in the silence of the night before the stars of heaven to testify against those priests who converted the kind teaching of Christinto sharp swords by which they cut the peoples necks and tore the bodies of the weak7192020 Spirits Rebellious by Khalil GibrannewthoughtlibrarycomgibranKhalilspiritsRebellious 811The sun disappeared behind the horizon as if tiring of the worlds troubles and loathing the peoples submission At that moment theevening began to weave a delicate veil from the sinews of silence and sread it upon Natures body I stretched my hand toward thegraves pointing at their symbols lifted my eyes toward heaven and cried out Oh Bravery this is your sword buried now in theearth Oh Love these are your flowers scorched by fire Oh Lord Jesus this is Thy cross submerged in the obscurity of the night Return to the Top Return to the TopChapter 3  Khalil The HereticPart OneSheik Abbas was looked upon as a prince by the people of a solitary village in North Lebanon His mansion stood in the midst ofthose poor villagers huts like a healthy giant amidst the sickly dwarfs He lived amid luxury while they pursued an existence ofpenury They obeyed him and bowed reverently before him as he spoke to them It seemed as though the power of mind hadappointed him its official interpreter and spokesman His anger would make them tremble and scatter like autumn leaves before astrong wind If he were to slap ones face it would be heresy on the individuals part to move or lift his head or make any attempt todiscover why the blow had come If he smiled at a man the villagers would consider the person thus honoured as the most fortunateThe peoples fear and surrender to Sheik Abbas were not due to weakness however their poverty and need of him had brought aboutthis state of continual humiliation Even the huts they lived in and the fields they cultivated were owned by Sheik Abbas who hadinherited them from his ancestorsThe farming of the land and the sowing of the seeds and the gathering of wheat were all done under the supervision of the Sheik whoin reward for their toil compensated them with a small portion of the crop which barely kept them from falling as victims of gnawingstarvationOften many of them were in need of bread before the crop was reaped and they came to Sheik Abbas and asked him with pouringtears to advance them a few piastres or a bushel of wheatm and the Sheik gladly granted their request for he knew that they wouldpay their debts doubly when harvest time came Thus those people remained obligated all their lives left a legacy of debts to theirchildren and were submissive to their master whose anger they had always feared and whose friendship and good will they hadconstantly but unsuccessfully endeavoured to winPart TwoWinter came and brought heavy snow and strong winds the valleys and the fields became empty of all things except leafless treeswhich stood as spectres of death above the lifeless plainsHaving stored the products of the land in the Sheiks bins and filled his vases with the wine of the vineyards the villagers retreated totheir huts to spend a portion of their lives idling by the fireside and commemorating the glory of the past ages and relating to oneanother the tales of weary days and long nightsThe old year had just breathed its last into the grey sky The night had arrived during which the New Year would be crowned andplaced upon the throne of the Universe The snow began to fall heavily and the whistling winds were racing from the lofty mountainsdown to the abyss and blowing the snow into heaps to be stored away in the valleysThe trees were shaking under the heavy storms and the fields and knolls were covered with a white floor upon which Death waswriting vague lines and effacing them The mists stood as partitions between the scattered villages by the sides of the valleys Thelights that flickered through the windows of those wretched huts disappeared behind the thick veil of Natures wrathFear penetrated the fellahins hearts and the animals stood by their mangers in the sheds while the dogs were hiding in the cornersOne could hear the voices of the sreaming winds and thundering of the storms resounding from the depths of the valleys It seemedas if Nature were enraged by the passing of the old year and trying to wrest revenge from those peaceful souls by fighting withweapons of cold and frostThat night under ths raging sky a young man was attempting to walk the winding trail that connected Deir Kizhaya with SheikAbbas village The youths limbs were numbed with cold while pain and hunger usurped him of his strength The black raiment hewore was bleached with the falling snow as if he were shrouded in death before the hour of his death had come He was strugglingagainst the wind His progress was difficult and he took but a few steps forward with each effort He called for help and then stoodsilent shivering in the cold night He had slim hope withering between great despair and deep sorrow He was like a bird with abroken wing who fell in a stream whose whirlpools carried him down to the depthsThe young man continued walking and falling until his blood stopped circulating and he collapsed He uttered a terrible sound   the voice of a soul who encountered the hollow face of Death    a voice of dying youth weakened by man and trapped by nature   a voice of the love of existence in the space of nothingnessPart Three7192020 Spirits Rebellious by Khalil GibrannewthoughtlibrarycomgibranKhalilspiritsRebellious 911On the north side of that village in the midst of the windtorn fields stood the solitary home of a woman named Rachel and herdaughter Miriam who had not then attained the age of eighteen Rachel was the widow of Samaan Ramy who was found slain sixyears earlier but the law of man did not find the murdererLike the rest of the Lebanese widows Rachel sustained life through long hard work During the harvest season she would look forears of corn left behind by others in the field and in Autumn she gathered the remnants of some forgotten fruits in the gardens InWinter she spun wool and made raiment for which she received a few piastres or a bushel of grain Miriam her daughter was abeautiful girl who shared with her mother the burden of toilThat bitter night the two women were sitting by the fireplace whose warmth was weakened by the frost and whose firebrands wereburied beneath the ashes By their side was a flickering lamp that sent its yellow dimmed rays into the heart of darkness like a prayerthat sends phantoms of hope into the hearts of the sorrowfulMidnight had come and they were listening to the wailing winds outside Every now and then Miriam would get up open the smalltransom and look toward the obscured sky and then she would return to her chair worried and frightened by the raging elementsSuddenly Miriam started as if she had awakened from a swoon of deep slumber She looked anxiously toward her mother and saidDid you hear that Mother Did you hear a voice calling for help The mother listened a moment and said I hear nothing but thecrying wind my daughter Then Miriam exclaimed I heard a voice deeper than the thundering heaven and more sorrowful thanthe wailing of the tempestHaving uttered these words she stood up and opened the door and listened for a moment Then she said I hear it again MotherRachel hurried toward the frail door and after a moments hesitation she said And I hear it too Let us go and seeShe wrapped herself with a long robe opened the door and walked out cautiously while Miriam stood at the door the wind blowingher long hairHaving forced her way a short distance through the snow Rachel stopped and shouted out Who is calling    where are you Therewas no answer then she repeated the same words again and again but she heard naught except thunder Then she courageouslyadvanced forward looking in every direction She had walked for some time when she found some deep footprints upon the snowshe followed them fearfullly and in a few moments found a human body lying before her on the snow like a patch on a white dressAs she appraoched him and leaned his head over her knees she felt his pulse that bespoke his slowing heart beats and his slimchance in life She turned her face toward the hut and called Come Miriam come and help me I have found him Miriam rushedout and followed her mothers footprints while shivering with cold and trembling with fear As she reached the place and saw theyouth lying motionless she cried with an aching voice The mother put her hands under his armpits calmed Miriam and said Fearnot for he is still living hold the lower edge of his cloak and let us carry him homeConfronted with the strong wind and heavy snow the two women carried the youth and started toward the hut As they reached thelittle haven they laid him down by the fireplace Rachel coomenced rubbing his numbed hands and Miriam drying his hair with theend of her dress The youth began to move after a few minutes His eyelids quivered and he took a deep sigh  a sigh that brought thehope of his safety into the hearts of the merciful women They removed his shoes and took off his black robe Miriam looked at hermother and said Observe his raiment Mother these clothes are worn by the monks After feeding the fire with a bundle of drysticks Rachel looked at her daughter with perplexity and said The monks do not leave their convent on such a terrible night AndMiriam inquired But he has no hair on his face the monks wear beards The mother gazed at him with eyes full of mercy andmaternal love then she turned to her daughter and said It makes no difference whether he is a monk or a criminal dry his feetwell my daughter Rachel opened a closet took from it a jar of wine and poured some in an earthenware bowl Miriam held hishead while the mother gave him some of it to stimulate his heart As he sipped the wine he opened his eyes for the first time and gavehis rescuers a sorrowful look mingled with tears of gratitude  the look of a human who felt the smooth touch of life after havingbeen gripped in the sharp claws of death  a look of great hope after hope had died Then he bent his head and his lips trembledwhen he uttered the words May God bless both of you Rachel placed her hand upon his shoulder and said Be calm brother Donot tire yourself with talking until you gain strength And Miriam added Rest your head on this pillow brother and we will placeyou closer to the fire Rachel refilled the bowl with wine and gave it to him She looked at her daughter and said Hang his robe bythe fire so it will dry Having executed her mothers command she returned and commenced looking at him mercifully as if shewanted to help him by pouring into his heart all the warmth of her soul Rachel brought two loaves of bread with some preserves anddry fruits she sat by him and began to feed him small morsels as a mother feeds her little child At this time he felt stronger and satup on the hearth mat while the red flames of fire reflected upon his sad face His eyes brightened and he shook his head slowlysaying Mercy and cruelty are both wrestling in the human heart like the mad elements in the sky of this terrible night but mercyshall overcome cruelty because it is divine and the terror alone of this night shall pass away when daylight comes Silenceprevailed for a minute and then he added with a whispering voice A human hand drove me into desperation and a human handrescued me how severe man is and how merciful man is And Rachel inquired How ventured you brother to leave the conventon such a terrible night when even the beasts do not venture forthThe youth shut his eyes as if he wanted to restore his tears back into the depths of his heart whence they came and he said Theanimals have their caves and the birds of the sky their nests but the son of man has not place to resthis head Rachel retortedThat is what Jesus said about himself And the young man resumed This is the answer for every man who wants to follow theSpirit and the Truth in this age of falsehood hypocrisy and corruptionAfter a few moments of contemplation Rachel said But there are many comfortable rooms in the convent and the coffers are full ofgold and all kinds of provisions The sheds of the convent are stocked with fat calves and sheep what made you leave such haven inthis deathly night The youth sighed deeply and said I left that place because I hated it And Rachel rejoined A monk in a7192020 Spirits Rebellious by Khalil GibrannewthoughtlibrarycomgibranKhalilspiritsRebellious 1011convent is like a soldier in the battlefield who is required to obey the orders of his leader regardless of their nature I heard that aman could not become a monk unless he did away with his will his thoughts his desires and all that pertains to the mind But agood priest does not ask his monks to do unreasonable things How could the head priest of Deir Kizhaya ask you to give up your lifeto the storms and snow And he remarked In the opinion of the head priest a man cannot become a monk unless he is blind andignorant senseless and dumb I left the convent because I ama sensible man who can see feel and hearMiriam and Rachel stared at him as if they had found in his face a hidden secret after a moment ofmeditation the mother said Willa man who sees and hears go out on a night that blinds the eyes and deafens the ears And the youth sated quietly I was expelledfrom the convent Expelled exclaimed Rachel and Miriam repeated the same word in unison with her motherHe lifted his head regretting his words for he was afraid lest their love and sympathy be converted into hatred and disrespect butwhen he looked at them and found the rays of mercy still emanating from their eyes and their bodies vibrating with anxiety to learnfurther his voice choked and he continued Yes I was expelled form the convent because I could not dig my grave with my ownhands and my heart grew weary of lying and pilfering I was expelled form the convent because my soul refused to enjoy the bountyof a people who surrendered themselves to ignorance I was driven away because I could not find rest in the comfortable rooms builtwith the money of the poor fellahin My stomach could not hold bread baked with the tears of the orphans My lips could not utterprayers sold for gold and food by the heads to the simple and faithful people I was expelled from the convent like a filthy leperbecause I was repeating to the monks the rules that qualified them to their present positionSilence prevailed while Rachel and Miriam were contemplating his words and gazing at him when they asked Are your father andmother living And he responded I have no father or mother now a place that is my home Rachel drew a deep sigh and Miriamturned her face toward the wall to hide hr merciful and loving tearsAs a withering flower is brought back to life by dew drops that dawn pours into its begging petals so the youths anxious heart wasenlivened by his benefactors affection and kindness He looked at them as a soldier looks upon his liberators who rescue him fromthe grip of the enemy and he resumed I lost my parents before I reached the age of seven The village priest took me to DeirKizhaya and left me at the disposal of the monks who were happy to take me in and put me in charge of the cows and sheep which Iled each day to the pasture When I attained the age of fifteen they put on me this black robe and led me into the altar whereuponthe head priest addressed me saying Swear by the name of God and all saints and make a vow to live a virtuous life of poverty andobedience I repeated the words before I realized their significance or comprehended his own interpretation of poverty virtue andobedienceMy name was Khalil and since that time the monks addressed me as Brother Mobarak but they never did treat me as a brotherThey ate the most palatable foods and drank the finest wine while I lived on dry vegetables and water mixed with tears Theyslumbered in soft beds while I slept on a stone slab in a dark and cold room by the shed Oftentimes I asked myself When will myheart stop craving for the food they eat and the wine they eat When will I cease to tremble with fear before my superiors But all myhopes were in vain for I was kept in the same state and in addition to caring for the cattle I was obliged to move heavy stones on myshoulders and to dig pits and ditches I sustained life on a few morsels of bread given to me in reward for my toil I knew of no otherplace to which I might go and the clergymen at the convent had caused me to abhor everything they were doing They had poisonedmy mind until I commenced to think that the whole world was an ocean of sorrows and miseries and that the convent was the onlyport of salvation But when I discovered the source of their food and gold I was happy that I did not share itKhalil straightened himself and looked about with wonder as if he had found something beautiful standing before him in thatwretched hut Rachel and Miriam remained silent and he proceeded God who took my father and exiled me as an orphan to theconvent did not want me to spend all my life walking blindly toward a dangerous jungle nor did He wish me to be a miserable slavefor the rest of my life God opened my eyes and ears and showed me the bright light and made me hear Truth when Truth wastalkingRachel thought aloud Is there any light other than the sun that shines over all the people Are human beings capable ofunderstanding the Truth Khalil returned The true light is that which emanates from within man and reveals the secrets of theheart to the soul making it happy and contented with life Truth is like the stars it does not appear except from behind obscurity ofthe night Truth is like all beautiful things in the world it does not disclose its desirability except to those who first feel the influenceof falsehood Truth is a deep kindness that teaches us to be content in our everyday life and share with the people the samehappinessRachel rejoined Many are those who live according to their goodness and many are those who believe that compassion to others isthe shadow of the law of God to man but still they do not rejoice in life for they remain miserable until death Khalil replied Vainare the beliefs and teachings that make man miserable and false is the goodness that leads him into sorrow and despair for it ismans purpose to be happy on this earth and lead the way to felicity and preach its gospel wherever he goes He who does not see thekingdom of heaven in this life will never see it in the coming life We came not into this life by exile but we came as innocentcreatures of God to learn how to worship the holy and eternal spirit and seek the hidden secrets within ourselves from the beauty oflife This is the truth which I have learned from the teachings of the Nazarene This is the light that came from within me and showedme the dark corners of the convent that threatened my life This is the deep secret which the beautiful valleys and fields revealed tome when I was

307Chapter 1I  S  S  U  E  SShocked as we may be today by drastic contrasts between thestandards of living in modern industrial nations and the standardsof living in Third World countries such disparities have beencommon for thousands of years of recorded history These disparitieshave extended beyond wealth to the things that create wealthincluding the knowledge skills habits and discipline that havedeveloped unequally in different geographic cultural and politicalsettingsThe ancient Greeks had geometry philosophy architecture andliterature at a time when Britain was a land of illiterate tribal peoplesliving at a primitive level Athens had the Acropolis whose ruins arestill impressive today thousands of years later at a time when therewas not a single building in all of Britain The ancient Greeks hadPlato Aristotle Euclid and other landmark figures who helped laythe intellectual foundations of Western civilization at a time whenthere was not a single Briton whose name had entered the pages ofhistory Scholars have estimated that there were parts of Europe in ancienttimes that were living at a level that Greece had transcendedthousands of years earlier1 There were other complex civilizations inthe ancient world not just in Greece but also in Egypt and Chinafor example at a time when peoples in various parts of Europe andelsewhere were just beginning to learn the rudiments of agriculture2Vast disparities in wealth and in wealthcreating capacity havebeen common for millennia But while large economic inequalities1have persisted throughout the recorded history of the human race theparticular pattern of those inequalities has changed drastically overthe centuries While Greeks were far more advanced than Britons inancient times Britons were far more advanced than Greeks in thenineteenth century when Britain led the world into the industrial age The Chinese were for centuries more advanced than any of theEuropeans including among their discoveries and inventions thecompass printing paper rudders and the porcelain plates that theWest called chinaware or simply china Cast iron was produced inChina a thousand years before it was produced in Europe3 A Chineseadmiral made a voyage of discovery longer than Columbus voyagegenerations before Columbus voyage and in ships larger and moreadvanced than Columbus ships4 But the relative positions of Chinaand Europe also reversed over the centuries Various other peoplesliving in various other parts of the world have had their own eras ofleadership in particular fields or in advances across many specialties Agriculture perhaps the most lifechanging advance in theevolution of human societies came to Europe from the Middle Eastin ancient times Agriculture made cities possible while huntergatherers required far too much land to provide themselves with foodfor them to settle permanently in such compact and denselypopulated communities Moreover for centuries cities around theworld have produced a wholly disproportionate share of all theadvances in the arts sciences and technology compared to theachievements of a similar number of people scattered in thehinterlands5Because Greeks were located nearer to the Middle East than thepeoples of Northern Europe or Western Europe agriculture spread tothe Greeks earlier and they could become urbanized earlier bycenturies and advanced in many ways far beyond peoples elsewherewho had not yet received the many benefits made possible by urbanliving The accident of geographic location could not create geniusbut it made possible a setting in which many people could developtheir own mental potential far beyond what was possible among2 Wealth Poverty and Politicsbands of huntergatherers roaming over vast territory preoccupiedwith the pressing need to search for foodGeography is just one of the influences behind vast economicdifferences among peoples and places Moreover these differences arenot simply differences in standards of living important as suchdifferences are Different geographic settings also expand or restrictthe development of peoples own mental potential into whateconomists call their human capital by presenting different peopleswith access to a wider or narrower cultural universe These geographicsettings differ not only horizontally as between Europe Asia andAfrica for example but also vertically as between peoples of theplains versus peoples living up in the mountains As one geographicstudy put itMountain regions discourage the budding of genius because they areareas of isolation confinement remote from the great currents of menand ideas that move along the river valleys6Many mountain regions around the world whether theAppalachian Mountains in the United States the Rif Mountains ofMorocco the Pindus Mountains of Greece the Himalayas or othermountains elsewhere show very similar patterns of poverty andbackwardness As distinguished French historian Fernand Braudelput it Mountain life persistently lagged behind the plain7 This wasespecially so during the millennia before the transportation andcommunications revolutions of the past two centuries whichbelatedly brought more of the progress of the outside world toisolated mountain villages What these technological revolutionscould not bring to the mountains however were the previouscenturies of cultural development that other people had in morefavorable environments Peoples living in mountains could try tocatch up but of course the rest of the world would not be standingstill while they were doing soMountains are just one geographic feature and geography is justone influence on human development But whether consideringIssues 3geography or culture isolation is a recurring factor in poverty andbackwardness around the world whether that is physical isolation orcultural isolation for any number of particular reasons that will beexplored in the chapters aheadWhatever the reasons for economic disparities among peoples andnations such disparities have been as common in modern times as inancient times In the twentyfirst century Switzerland Denmark andGermany have each had more than three times the per capita GrossDomestic Product GDP of Albania Serbia or Ukraine and Norwayhas had more than five times the per capita GDP of these lattercountries8 Such economic disparities are not peculiar to Europe  InAsia as well Japan has more than three times the per capita GDP ofChina and more than nine times the per capita GDP of India9 SubSaharan Africa has less than onetenth the per capita GDP of thecountries of the Euro zone10Within nations as well as between nations income disparitiesabound whether between classes races or other subdivisions of thehuman species Reactions to these economic disparities have rangedfrom resignation to revolution Because many people regard thesedisparities in their own country as strange if not sinister it is necessaryto note that such disparities are not peculiar to any particular time orplace Therefore explanations of economic differences cannot beconfined to factors peculiar to a particular time or place such asmodern capitalism or the industrial revolution much less to factorsthat are politically convenient or emotionally satisfyingFactors which raise morally momentous issues such as conquestand enslavement cannot automatically be assumed to be equally4 Wealth Poverty and Politics According to the authors of Why Nations Fail World inequality today existsbecause during the nineteenth and twentieth centuries some nations were able to takeadvantage of the Industrial Revolution and the technologies and methods oforganization that it brought while others were unable to do so Daron Acemoglu andJames A Robinson Why Nations Fail The Origins of Power Prosperity and PovertyNew York Crown Business 2012 p 271 But economic inequalities among nationsdid not begin with the industrial revolution and the international inequalities ofancient times were by no means necessarily less than the inequalities of today Issues 5momentous as causal explanations of current economic disparitiesThey may be or they may not in particular cases Peoples or nationsmay be rich or poor because 1 they produced more or produced lessthan others or 2 they seized more of what others had produced orhad what they produced seized from them What anyone might preferto believe at a given place or time has nothing to do with what thehard facts areThere is no question that the Spaniards conquests in the WesternHemisphere for example not only brutalized the conquered peoplesand destroyed viable civilizations but also drained vast amounts ofexisting wealth in gold and silver from the Western Hemisphere toSpain 200 tons of gold and more than 18000 tons of silver11 theresult of the looting of existing treasures from the indigenous peoplesand the forced labor of that same population in gold and silver minesNor was Spain unique in such behavior But the question herehowever is To what extent can transfers of wealth explain economicdifferences between peoples and nations in the world today Spain is today one of the poorer countries in Western Europesurpassed economically by countries like Switzerland and Norwaywhich have never had comparable empires The vast wealth thatpoured into Spain in its golden age could have been invested in itseconomy or in its people But it was not It was spent Spaniardsthemselves spoke of gold as pouring down on Spain like rain on aroof flowing on away immediately12 Nor has it been uncommon inhistory for a vast amount of human suffering whether by conqueredor enslaved people to produce nothing more than a transientenrichment of a ruling eliteThe monumental moral depredations of Spain in the WesternHemisphere had very little causal effect on the longrun prosperity ofthe Spanish economy As late as 1900 more than half the people inSpain were still illiterate13 while most blacks in the United Stateswere literate despite having been free for less than 50 years14 Acentury later in the year 2000 the real per capita income in Spain wasslightly lower than the real per capita income of black Americans15Moral questions and causal questions are both important Butconfusing one with the other or imagining that they can simply becombined into one politically or ideologically attractive package isnot a very promising approach to an explanation of economicdifferencesEconomic disparities among nations are just part of the story ofeconomic inequalities Large economic disparities within nations alsoneed to be addressed When considering economic differences amongthe people of a given country there is a tendency to see thesedifferences as issues about what is called income distribution16 Butreal income that is money income adjusted for inflation consistsof the goods and services produced in the nation To look at thisoutput solely from the viewpoint of those receiving money for havingproduced those goods and services risks needless misconceptions andserious social problems growing out of misconceptions The standard of living of a nation depends more on its output percapita than on the money received as income for producing thatoutput Otherwise government could make us all rich simply byprinting more money By focusing on what is called incomedistribution many people proceed as if the government can rearrangethese flows of money so as to have incomes become more fairhowever defined disregarding what the repercussions of such apolicy might be on the more fundamental process of producing goodsand services on which a countrys standard of living depends But inthe vision presented in the media and often even in academia it is asif output or wealth just exist somehow and the really interestingquestion is how it is distributed Sometimes this preoccupation with the receipt of incomes to theneglect of attention to the production of the output behind thatreceipt of incomes can lead to attempts to explain the receipt of verylarge incomes by greed as if an insatiable desire for vast amountsof money will somehow cause others to pay those vast amounts for thepurchase of ones goods or services 6 Wealth Poverty and PoliticsIssues 7Among the many possible causes of differences in income andwealth whether among peoples regions or nations one of the mostobvious is often ignored As economist Henry Hazlitt put itThe real problem of poverty is not a problem of distribution but ofproduction The poor are poor not because something is being withheldfrom them but because for whatever reason they are not producingenough17What seemed obvious to Henry Hazlitt was not obvious to manyothers who have had alternative visions with alternative agendas ascorollaries of those visions The difference between seeing economicdisparities as due to differences in the production of wealth and seeingthose disparities as due to the transfer of wealth from some people toother people is fundamental History shows that either cause of economic disparities can prevailat particular times and places The approach here will be to seekexplanations of disparities in the production of wealth though thetransfer of wealth whether through conquest or enslavement in thepast or through the welfare state domestically or foreign aidinternationally today will also be dealt with  When exploring the influences of geographic cultural and otherfactors affecting the production of wealth a sharp distinction must bemade between influence and determinism At one time some peoplebased their explanations of economic disparities among peoples andnations on geographic determinism Places with rich naturalresources for example were supposed to be more prosperous thanplaces lacking such resources It was easy enough for critics to showthat this was by no means always the case nor necessarily true in mostcases since there are povertystricken countries like Venezuela andNigeria with rich natural resources and prosperous countries likeJapan and Switzerland with very few natural resources Such resultshave led to a dismissal not only of geographic determinism but alsoof geography as a major influence in other senses8 Wealth Poverty and Politics  The Gulf Stream originating in the subtropical waters of the Gulf of Mexicoflows northeastward through the Atlantic Ocean past the British Isles creatingmilder winters in Western Europe than at the same latitudes in Eastern EuropeAsia or North AmericaGeography however influences economic outcomes in other verydifferent ways Moreover this influence is not necessarily due toparticular geographic features considered in isolation but is often due tointeractions among particular geographic features with other geographicfeatures as well as interactions with other nongeographic factors suchas cultural demographic political or other influences Even such a simple and undisputed geographic fact as placeslocated nearer the poles having lower temperatures on average thanplaces located nearer the equator does not always hold up wheninteractions with other geographic factors are taken into accountThus London which is hundreds of miles farther north than Bostonhas average winter temperatures warmer than those in Boston andvery similar to winter temperatures in American cities hundreds ofmiles south of Boston18 The average December daily hightemperature in London is the same as the average December dailyhigh temperature in Washington DC which is more than 850 milesfarther south than London The average daily low temperature inWashington is slightly lower than in London for every month fromDecember through March19 Latitude matters but so too does thevarying warmth of different ocean currents and the interaction ofthe two can create very different outcomes from what either wouldproduce by itself   When particular geographic factors interact with other nongeographic factors as well the outcomes can likewise be verydifferent from what they would be if considering particulargeographic cultural demographic or political factors in isolationThat is why influence is not the same as determinism Since many ifnot most economic outcomes depend on more than one factor thelikelihood of all the various factors coming together in such a way asto produce equal levels of prosperity and progress among peoples andnations around the world seems very remote Radically differentgeographic settings are just one of the factors making equal economicoutcomes unlikelyCultures are another factor that differs greatly among peoples andnations as well as among individuals and groups within a givennation Like critics of geographic influences critics of culturalinfluences have likewise sometimes resorted to an oversimplifiedpicture of these influences For example an attempt to discredit theinfluence of cultural factors in economic outcomes by a wellknownstudy Why Nations Fail rejected the idea that the cultureinherited from England explained why former colonies of Englandlike the United States Canada and Australia were prosperousCanada and the United States were English colonies but so were SierraLeone and Nigeria The variation in prosperity within former Englishcolonies is as great as that in the entire world The English legacy is notthe reason for the success of North America20While it is true that all these countries are former colonies ofEngland and thus might be described as having been influenced bythe culture of England it is also true that the people who foundedCanada and the United States were Englishmen descendants ofpeople steeped in the culture of England as it unfolded over thecenturies while people in Sierra Leone and Nigeria weredescendants of people steeped in the very different cultures of a regionof subSaharan Africa for many centuries and exposed to the cultureof England for less than one century during which their ownindigenous cultures were by no means extinguished during thehistorically brief period when they were part of the British EmpireMany former English colonies populated by nonEnglish peoplescontinued to observe some aspect of the culture of England afterbecoming independent lawyers wearing wigs in court forexample but these outward observances of English traditions didnot prevent these former colonies from having a fundamentally veryIssues 9different cultural legacy from that of England and a very differenteconomic and political experience going forward after independenceBelievers in genetic determinism likewise seek to discredit culturalfactors which compete with their view that it is innate differences inintelligence among individuals and groups which explain differencesin economic disparities among races nations and civilizations Butgenetic determinism based on undeniable contemporary differencesin various kinds of achievements and mental test scores21 cannotexplain equally undeniable radical changes in which particular racesnations or civilizations have been far ahead and which have been farbehind in different periods of history the British and the Greeksbeing just one example of role reversals out of many  Nations which went from being poor and backward to reachingthe front ranks of human achievement in a century Scotlandbeginning in the eighteenth century and Japan beginning in thenineteenth century for example have changed faster than geneticmakeup seems likely to change and in fact with no indication of anygenetic changes at all though there are many indications of culturalchanges in both these cases Researchers may be frustrated by the factthat the origins of particular cultures may be lost in the mists of timethough their contemporary manifestations are visible Culture alsodoes not readily lend itself to quantification as a contemporarygenetic determinist has pointed out22 or to statistical analysis thatcan show such things as correlations between IQ and Gross DomesticProduct lending an air of scientific precision But as statisticians haveoften pointed out correlation is not causation And as was said longago It is better to be roughly right than precisely wrong23Whether considering cultural geographic political or other factorsinteractions of these factors are part of the reason why understandinginfluences is very different from claiming determinism10 Wealth Poverty and PoliticsChapter 2GEOGRAPHIC   FACTORSThe world has never been a level playingfield and everything costsDavid S Landes1It is obvious that peoples around the world have lived and developedover the millennia in different geographic settings What is not soobvious is how much those settings have differed from one anotherand the economic and social consequences of those differencesGeography is not egalitarian Geographic features are not even approximately equal in differentregions of the world The disparities in geographic settings and in thephenomena which arise from those settings are at least as great as theincome disparities that many people find so surprising For example farmore tornadoes occur in the middle of the United States than in anyother country or in all of the other countries of the world combined2Most of the geysers in the world are in Yellowstone National Park3Earthquakes are as common around the rim of the Pacific in bothAsia and the Western Hemisphere as they are rare around the rim ofthe Atlantic4These natural phenomena are simply illustrations of disparities inthe physical effects of great variations in geographic conditions Butthere are also major economic and social effects of other disparities ingeographically based phenomena The very land that people stand onis not the same in different places Highly fertile soils that scientists11call mollisols are neither evenly nor randomly distributed around theworld Such soils are found almost exclusively in the temperate zonesof the Northern and Southern Hemispheres and are scattered veryunevenly there but are virtually nonexistent in the tropics5This was especially important during the ages when agriculturewas the most prevalent and most important of human economicactivities which is to say for thousands of years except for somemore fortunate regions within the most recent centuries Theeconomies and cultures that evolved during those millennia did sowithin very different economic limits in different geographic settingsThe economic effects of geographic differences are both directaffecting standards of living and indirect affecting the developmentof peoples themselves depending on whether a given geographicsetting facilitates or impedes their communication and interactionswith the rest of the human race No society has had a monopoly onthe discoveries and inventions that have advanced human beings sofor a given set of people whether a class a race or a nation to bein touch with what other peoples around the world are doing has beena major advantage A larger cultural universe is important not simply because of theproducts technologies and knowledge that are transferredimportant as these are but also and perhaps equally or moreimportant because people seeing repeatedly how things have beendone differently by others in different places can break through thenormal human inertia that keeps people doing the same things in thesame familiar ways for generations or even centuries as happens inmany geographically isolated societies It has been said thatintellectual force is something that feeds upon the nutritious foodof wide comparisons6Conversely isolation tends to have the opposite effect When theSpaniards discovered the isolated Canary Islands in the fifteenthcentury they found the people there living much as people had livedin the stone age7 Similarly when the British discovered the isolatedAustralian aborigines in the eighteenth century8 In other isolated12 Wealth Poverty and Politicssettings as well whether in distant mountain villages or deep intropical jungles peoples have been found living as others had lived inearlier centuries or millennia9 Deserts are another geographic factor isolating peoples Thelargest of the worlds deserts by far is the Sahara Desert which is anegative factor for the peoples of North Africa but a devastatinghandicap for the peoples to the south black Africans in tropical subSaharan Africa This incomparably vast desert slightly larger thanthe 48 contiguous states of the United States10 has been forcenturies the largest single factor isolating the peoples of subSaharanAfrica from the rest of the world The dearth of good harbors intropical Africa also limited contacts with overseas cultures AsFernand Braudel put it external influence filtered only very slowlydrop by drop into the vast African continent South of the Sahara11Despite geographic influences there can be no geographicdeterminism because where peoples are in touch with other peopleseven an unchanging geographic setting interacts with changinghuman knowledge and differing human cultures that have differentvalues and aspirations producing very different outcomes at differenttimes and places Most of what are natural resources for us today werenot natural resources for the cave man who had not yet acquired theknowledge of how these things could be used for his own purposesThere have been vast deposits of petroleum in the Middle East fromtime immemorial But it was only after science and technology hadadvanced to a level that created industrial nations elsewhere that theMiddle Easts oil became a valuable asset profoundly changing life inboth the Middle East and in the industrial countries Individual geographic influences cannot be considered in isolationsince their interactions crucially affect outcomes The relationshipbetween rainfall and soil is just one example of these interactions Notonly does rainfall vary greatly from one place to another so does theability of the soil to hold the water that rains down on it This crucialability to hold water is much less in the limestone soils of the Balkansthan in the loess soils of northern China Since climate and soil affectGeographic Factors 13how well different crops can be grown in different places that hasvirtually precluded equal prosperity in all regions of the world duringthe millennia when agriculture was the most important economicactivity around the world and the basis for the urban development ofdifferent societies and peoples As with many other things the ability of land to hold water is abenefit only within some given range of variation Back in Romantimes the very flat lands of northwestern Europe located in an areaof plentiful rainfall resulted in many swamps and swampy placeswhich were major impediments to agriculture Only after centuries ofdevelopment and application of drainage techniques did much of thisland become fertile12 Fertility is not always something inherent andimmutable The development of drainage and irrigation techniquesor of plows that can be harnessed to horses or oxen to plow heavysoils greatly affects their fertility It was the interaction of the soilrainfall and changing human knowledge and technology over timethat made the lands of northwestern Europe become very fertileWhat this means more generally is that the possible combinationsand permutations of geographic factors greatly exceed the number offactors considered separately especially when combined withchanging human knowledge over time Therefore the large number ofpossible economic and other outcomes in differing geographicsettings makes equal outcomes for different regions and peoplesaround the world even less likely than a separate enumeration ofgeographic differences might suggest There has been nothingresembling equal opportunities to become equally productive amongthe tribal racial or national groups that developed for thousands ofyears in different parts of the world and evolved their respectivecultures in different geographic settings Not only have equal economic outcomes been rare to nonexistentthe particular patterns of inequality in one era have differed greatlyfrom the particular patterns of inequality in another eraThe vast superiority of ancient Greek society to that in ancientBritain reflected Greeces geographic advantage in being located near14 Wealth Poverty and PoliticsGeographic Factors 15the Middle East where agriculture developed and spread into nearbysoutheastern Europe centuries before it spread to all of Europe andbeyond Without agriculture it is difficult if not virtually impossibleto have densely populated urban societies as distinguished fromsocieties of wandering hunters and gatherers or herders all ofwhom require vast amounts of land on which to roam in order to getenough food to sustain a given number of people To the present day cities have remained the sources of much if notmost of the advancements in civilization Far more of these advancesand especially of landmark scientific and technological achievementshave occurred among the populations of cities than among a similarnumber of people living in other settings13 Peoples without thegeographic prerequisites for cities have long lagged behind peoples insettings that facilitated urbanization Cities developed relatively latein the existence of the human species and so did most of theadvances in what we today recognize as civilization By making citiespossible agriculture made possible the great industrial medical andother advances that flourished in urban environments Modern advances in transportation and communication can breakthrough the isolation of many peoples just as other technologicaladvances can mitigate or sometimes even eliminate the handicaps ofvarious other kinds of geographic impediments to economic andsocial development But what these historically recent advancescannot do is retroactively erase the effects of thousands of years ofdifferent cultural development that took place where there wereserious geographic restrictions as compared to places inhabited bypeoples with millennia of experiences enriched by wider exposures tothe achievements and ideas of other peoples around the worldHow we define the concept of environment is crucial Onedistinguished geographers definition was Environment is the totalphysical setting amid which people live14 But another geographersaid environment means something more than local geographicconditions and called for a larger conception of environment15pointing out how the past experiences of forebears have left theirmark on the present race in the form of inherited aptitudes andtraditional customs acquired in those remote ancestral habitats16Whether an environment is described geographically orsocioeconomically the most fundamental distinction is betweendefining environment as what is around a given people and definingenvironment to include also what is within those peopleWe cannot understand what is happening today withoutunderstanding past conditions that shaped both the physical andmental worlds of people living today which are a legacy of the past forbetter or worse As one cultural historian put it men are not blanktablets upon which the environment inscribes a culture which canreadily be erased to make way for a new inscription17 As anothernoted historian put it We do not live in the past but the past in us18Against this general background we can now examine in moredetail the influences of such geographic factors as waterwaysmountains and flora and fauna Geographic location as such is also afactor whose influence is worth noting quite aside from the particulargeographic features of a particular locationWATERWAYSWaterways play many vital roles as drinking water for humansand animals as sources of food such as fish and other aquaticcreatures as sources of irrigation for crops and as arteries oftransportation for cargo and people In all these roles waterwaysdiffer from one another in ways that can make them more valuable orless valuable to humans Waterways obviously differ in kind from rivers to lakes harborsand seas and each kind in turn has its own internal differences innavigability for example Rivers flowing gently across wide levelplains as in Western Europe are far more usable for both commerceand the transportation of people than rivers plunging down fromgreat heights through rapids cascades and waterfalls as in most of16 Wealth Poverty and PoliticsGeographic Factors 17subSaharan Africa Indeed the same stream of water can differ atdifferent places along its route to the seaA torrent that issues from its source in the mountains is not the riverwhich reaches the sea On its long journey from highland to lowland itreceives now the milky waters of a glacierfed stream now a muddytributary from agricultural lands now the clear waters from a limestoneplateau while all the time its racing current bears a burden of soil tornfrom its own banks19Although the most indispensable role of waterways has been toprovide drinking water for humans and animals without which theycannot survive one of the most important roles of waterways foreconomic development has been their role as transportation arteries Thecrucial fact about the role of waterways as transportation arteries forcargo and people is the vast difference in cost between land transportand water transport which was even greater in the millennia before theadvent of motorized land transport less than two centuries ago In 1830 for example it cost more than 30 dollars to move a ton ofcargo 300 miles on land but only 10 dollars to ship it 3000 milesacross the Atlantic Ocean20 One consequence of such transportationcost differentials was that people living in the city of Tiflis in theCaucasus 341 miles from the Baku oil fields by land bought oilimported from America 8000 miles away by water21 Similarly inmidnineteenth century America before the transcontinental railroadwas built San Francisco could be reached both faster and cheaperacross the Pacific Ocean from a port in China than it could be reachedover land from the banks of the Missouri River22Given the vast amounts of food fuel and other necessities of lifethat must be transported into cities and the vast amounts of a citysoutput that must be transported out to sell there is no mystery whyso many cities around the world have been located on navigablewaterways especially before the transportation revolutions within thepast 200 years that produced motorized transport on land Even in the twentieth century the differential cost of landtransport and water transport did not disappear In twentieth centuryAfrica the estimated cost of shipping an automobile by land fromDjibouti to Addis Ababa 342 miles was the same as the cost ofshipping it by water from Detroit to Djibouti 7386 miles23Looked at differently where there has been a lack of navigablewaterways accessibility to the outside world has often been severelylimited shrinking the cultural universe drastically and with itshrinking the opportunities of peoples to connect with other peoples andcultures far away In some cases a dearth of waterways and the presenceof geographic barriers meant that people living only 10 or 20 miles fromeach other often had very little contact This was especially so in placeslacking horses camels or other beasts of burden during the manycenturies before modern transportation and communications developed One of the remarkable facts about the continent of Africa is thatalthough Africa is more than twice the size of Europe the Africancoastline is shorter than the European coastline24 This is possibleonly because the European coastline twists and turns creating manyharbors where ships can dock sheltered from the rough waters of theopen seas Moreover the coastline of Europe is increased by the manyislands and peninsulas that make up more than onethird of thatcontinents total land area By contrast the African coastline is smooth with few substantialindentations few good natural harbors and fewer islands andpeninsulas which make up only 2 percent of Africas land areaMoreover coastal waters around subSaharan Africa are often tooshallow for oceangoing ships to dock25 In such places large oceangoing ships must anchor offshore and have their cargoes unloadedonto smaller vessels that can operate in shallow waters But this timeconsuming process and the greater amount of labor and equipmentrequired is more costly often prohibitively costly For centuriesseaborne commerce between Europe and Asia sailed around Africaand seldom stoppedEven in those few places where large ships can enter Africa ondeep rivers tropical Africas coasts have narrow coastal plains thatoften end abruptly against escarpments26 One important18 Wealth Poverty and Politicsconsequence of this shape of the land is that even in places whereships can enter the continent on African rivers they can seldom getvery far inland before being confronted with cascades and waterfallsFor the same reason boats coming from the vast interior of thecontinent are seldom able to continue out to the open sea as boatsand even large ships can do in various places on the Eurasianlandmass or in parts of the Western HemisphereBy contrast with Africa China has had a huge network ofnavigable waterways described as unique in the world formed bythe Yangtze River and its tributaries as well as an indented coastlinefull of harbors27 What was also unique were the centuries duringwhich China was the most advanced nation in the world on intowhat were called the Middle Ages in Europe It was not just in harbors but also in rivers that Chinas waterwayshave contrasted with those in Africa Africa is a dry continent withmany of its rivers not deep enough to carry the large ships with heavyloads that are carried on the rivers of China Western Europe or theUnited States Even the Nile was unable to carry the largest ships in thedays of the Roman Empire28 much less the even larger ships of today The average depth of a river is not as important as its minimumdepth on the route of a given vessels journey which is whatdetermines how far a boat or ship of a given size and weight can goThe same word navigable may be applied to many verydifferent waterways but with very different meanings in specificconcrete circumstances Although the St Lawrence Seaway isnavigable by oceangoing ships all the way into the Great Lakes thatdoes not mean that it is navigable by all oceangoing ships Whenmajor manmade improvements were made to the Seaway in 1959and for many years thereafter it was navigable by most of the oceangoing ships in the world but as such ships grew larger and larger overthe years today it is no longer navigable by most oceangoing shipsthough it is still navigable by many29The Zambezi River in Africa has highly variable depths from placeto place and from rainy season to dry season In some times and placesGeographic Factors 19the Zambezi is barely navigable by boats requiring just 3 feet of waterthough at other times and places the water level is 20 feet deeper30Some rivers in Angola can support boats requiring no more than 8feet of water31 During the dry season even a major West Africanriver like the Niger can carry barges weighing no more than 12 tons32But in China ships weighing 10000 tons have been able to gohundreds of miles up the Yangtze River and smaller vessels anotherthousand miles beyond that33Rivers in tropical Africa are seldom continuously navigable for anysuch distances even when these rivers have ample water In terms ofthe contours of the land subSaharan Africa has been characterizedas cursed with a mesa form which converts nearly every river into aplunging torrent on its approach to the sea34Most of tropical Africa is more than 1000 feet above sea level andmuch of it is more than 2000 feet above sea level Thus the ZaireRiver begins at an altitude of 4700 feet and so must come down thatvertical distance before flowing out into the Atlantic Ocean creatingrapids cascades and waterfalls on the way Although the Zaire hasmore water than the Mississippi the Yangtze or the Rhine that doesnot make it the equivalent of these and other major commercialwaterways elsewhere because the Zaires many plunges interrupt itsnavigability though it may carry extensive inland traffic for variousdistances on level stretches This pattern is common among the riversof subSaharan Africa Another pattern that is common in tropical Africa is a widefluctuation in the water level of its rivers due to highly varyingrainfall amounts in different seasons Unlike Western Europe wherethe rain falls more or less evenly throughout the year35 rainfallpatterns in subSaharan Africa include long periods when there is norain at all followed by

short season the large craft have tocome out first because of the fall in the level of the water the mediumsized craft follow and the small canoes may continue for some timeevacuating small quantities of produce37Statistics on how many miles of navigable rivers there are in Africacan be very misleading when these are not continuous miles that avessel of a given size and weight can travel before encountering watertoo shallow to support it or encountering cascades or waterfalls thatstop all vessels Sometimes a canoe can go ashore and be emptied ofits cargo before reaching a waterfall with both the canoe and thecargo then being carried around the waterfall so that the reloadedcanoe can proceed on another level stretch of water However this isboth a timeconsuming and therefore expensive process and onethat limits the size of both the canoe and its cargo The net result isthat only a cargo that is very valuable in proportion to its size andweight is economically feasible to transport in such placesBy contrast in other parts of the world where rivers arecontinuously navigable for hundreds of miles across level plains as invarious places on the Eurasian landmass or in the WesternHemisphere bulky cargoes with relatively low value in proportion totheir size and weight wood coal or wheat for example may beeconomically viable to transport long distances by waterEven within the same continent Western Europes rivers havebeen very different from the rivers in Eastern Europe or SouthernEurope as well as radically different from the rivers of subSaharanAfrica A broad coastal plain where the land nowhere reaches 1000feet above sea level means that Western Europe has had slowflowingrivers which were especially valuable in the long ages before powerboats could readily go against the flow of swiftmoving currents Inmany places during that era logs for example could be floated downa river even when the only way for people in charge of those logs toreturn home was by landWestern Europes rivers often lead out into the open seas providingaccess to seaports around the world But most rivers in Eastern Europeand Southern Europe are quite different in ways that affect botheconomic activity and the size of the cultural universe available to thepeoples living in the regions through which these rivers flow Becausethe warming effect of the Gulf Stream on the climate of WesternEurope is lessened the farther east one goes the waterways of EasternEurope are frozen more often and longer in the winters Even when the rivers of Eastern Europe are flowing often they areflowing into lakes or inland seas rather than out into the open seas thatconnect with the rest of the world The waters of the Danube the Donand the Dnieper flow into the Black Sea for example and the watersof the Volga flow into the Caspian Sea But most of the water inRussian rivers flows into the Arctic Ocean which is hardly as accessibleto the rest of the world as are the Atlantic or the Pacific Thesedifferences in waterways are among the many reasons why EasternEurope has lagged economically behind Western Europe for centuries The rivers of Southern Europe have contributed even less to theeconomic development of that region partly because there are fewermajor rivers than in Western Europe or Eastern Europe and partlybecause the climate in the lands of Mediterranean Europe is one withtorrential downpours in winter and very little rain in the summerwhen rivers almost dry up In the mountainous Balkans rivers oftenflow too steeply to be navigable except for some that are

importance of agriculture as a source of adependable food supply for a concentrated and sedentary populationfishing has been another source and one available in regions whereagriculture has not been sufficiently productive to sustain human lifeby itself This has been especially important in very cold climates45In other climates as well fishing can be a major economic activity Itwas said at one time that Amsterdam was built on herring46 and fishinghas also been important to the economy of Japan among other placesHowever agriculture may not be as productive in tropical lands wherethe fertility of the soil is often poor as in the Amazon jungles wherethere are many fishing villagesFishing villages represent a step upward from a huntergatheringsociety to a sedentary life even though these villages may not representthe same degree of population concentration as cities fed by agricultureHowever commercial fishing supplying a market reaching far beyondthe local area can be a major contributor to the development of cities47In some of the lands around the Mediterranean the soil yields so littlein agriculture that many people have had to piece together a livelihoodby combining the products of both the land and the sea as others in thatregion have by combining agriculture and herding animals48Fishing opportunities however are no more evenly distributedaround the world than other opportunities A long continental shelfreaching out into the Atlantic Ocean creates an underwaterenvironment where fish and other marine life can flourish49 But theland is shaped differently around and under the Mediterranean Sea50which lacks the shallow shelves of the Atlantic51As a result while there has long been fishing in theMediterranean it has not been comparable to the rich fishing regionsthat attract commercial fishing vessels great distances to the Atlanticwaters near Newfoundland and Iceland or into the North Sea fishinggrounds52 The net result in the early twentieth century was that anItalian fishermans earnings averaged about onefourth the earnings ofa French fisherman and oneeighth those of an English fishermanNor was this due to differences in the price of fish which was nohigher in France or England than in Italy53While waterways have played major roles in the economic andsocial development of many regions of the world these roles haveoften been due to interactions of waterways with other geographic andnongeographic factors rather than being based on the nature of theGeographic Factors 2526 Wealth Poverty and Politicswaterways alone South Americas

foragriculture as is climate Special features of the land such asmountains deserts and rift valleys can fragment a population andisolate the fragments from each other This has been the fate of muchof the Balkans of subSaharan Africa and of mountain communitiesin many countries around the world MountainsMountains affect both the lives of people living in those mountainsand the lives of people living on the land below and it affects thesetwo sets of people very differentlyAbout 10 to 12 percent of the worlds population lives inmountains about half in Asia and about 90 percent live no higher inthe mountains than 2500 meters or 8200 feet Population density inmountains is usually relatively low55 Certain common patterns haveappeared in the lives of people living in various mountaincommunities around the world whether the Appalachian Mountainsin the United States the Rif Mountains of Morocco the PindusMountains of Greece or the Himalayas in Asia The most commonof these patterns have included poverty isolation and backwardness56Nor is it hard to see why The very nature of mountains long deniedthe people living there many of the things that promote prosperityand connection with the general progress in the rest of the worldFertile land can seldom be found on mountainsides where soil isreadily washed away by rain though some of this soil collects down inmountain valleys while the rest of it is washed away down into thelowlands People tend to gather in the flat areas of land in the valleysamid the mountains since this is where crops can be grown mostreadily But mountain valleys are often isolated from each other withthe population being as scattered as the flat lands they occupy aswas said of mountain communities in the Southern mountains in theUnited States57 though the same pattern has existed elsewherearound the world The amount of usable soil in each valley tends tolimit the number of people who can be fed there so that small villageshave often been the norm These villages may be isolated from eachother as well as being isolated from the outside world even whenthese villages are not far from each other as the crow flies but are notvery accessible to each other across rough mountain terrain58These historic handicaps were especially severe during themillennia before modern transportation and communicationstechnologies were created However these technological advanceshave almost invariably originated outside the mountains themselvesand the extent to which they have been adopted has varied with localgeographic and economic conditions Moreover even where theseadvances have been adopted extensively that cannot undo the effectsof previous centuries of cultural isolation Navigable waterways are often lacking in mountain terrain wherethe steepness of the land makes for rapids cascades and waterfalls sothis means of transportation and communication has often beendenied to people in many mountain communities such as in theBalkans59 Land transportation is also likely to be difficult especiallywhere the rugged terrain is inhospitable to wheeled vehicles so thattravel on foot is the only feasible way to get around in many placesDistinguished historian Fernand Braudel pointed out that in 1881the wheeled vehicle was still unknown in Morocco60 As anotherscholar said of people in the Rif Mountains of Morocco The Rifiansare great walkers and they have to be61Although such patterns may be general there are also exceptionsParts of the Himalayas and the Andes for example have fertile andwellwatered land62 The

even in the twentyfirst century67However modern transportation and communications technologiesare making inroads into the isolation of many mountaincommunities68 though with great differences among differentregions of the world Switzerland for example has more than 20times as many miles of road per capita as in Ethiopia69Distinguished American scholar Edward C Banfields classicaccount of an Italian mountain village where he lived in 1954 and1955 The Moral Basis of a Backward Society noted that there was onlyone telephone in town In this community of 3400 people to whichhe gave the pseudonym Montegrano there were five automobilesfor hire but no one owned a private car Most of the people were poorfarmers and laborers Onethird of the men and twothirds of thewomen could neither read nor write and some peasants had nevergone beyond the next village just four miles away70 When theytraveled they seldom used a cart much less a car to transport thebelongings they took with them As Professor Banfield notedWhen the farm people of Montegrano travel it is on foot leading a donkeyto the sides of which large baskets are fixed   The range of travel then islimited to nearby towns Many people have never travelled beyond theseneighboring towns and some women have never left Montegrano71Geographic Factors 2930 Wealth Poverty and PoliticsIt was not only infrastructure and technological advances thatreached mountain communities belatedly So did cultures prevailingon the plains below Although Islam has for centuries been theprevailing religion and culture of the Middle East and North Africaa different religion and culture continued to prevail in theneighboring mountainous regions of Armenia and Abyssinia Andthough people in the Rif Mountains of Morocco eventually adoptedIslam this was centuries after the people on the land below hadalready become Muslims72Language likewise moved slowly up from the lowlands to thehighlands Gaelic continued to survive in the Scottish highlands longafter the Scottish lowlanders were speaking English and the Vlachlanguage survived in the Pindus Mountains of Greece centuries afterpeople on the land below were speaking Greek73 Languagedifferences have added to the sources of isolation in the mountainsespecially when the languages or dialects spoken in the mountainswere unknown in most of the outside world Of the more than onethousand languages in New Guinea more than 70 percent originatein the mountainous regions which cover only onethird of theisland74 A multiplicity of languages and dialects has been common inisolated mountain communities around the world75Law and order are yet another part of the social infrastructure thathas been harder to establish and maintain in many mountain regionsEven mountains nominally under the control of a nation or empirehave not always or in all places been effectively under such controlExamples include the mountains of Montenegro under the OttomanEmpire the Rif Mountains under Moroccan sultans and the uplandsof India under the Mughal rulers76 Both the Scottish highlands andthe highlands of colonial Ceylon remained independent for manyyears after their respective nearby lowlands were conquered andincorporated into another cultural universe In centuries past it wascommon in many mountain regions around the world for thehighland people to raid and plunder the more prosperous people inthe lowlands77Poverty in many mountain communities long exceeded anythingknown as poverty in most other settings As Professor Banfield saidof the Italian mountain village in which he lived in 1954 and 1955Most people in Montegrano are desperately poor Many have nothing toeat but bread and not enough of that Even the welltodo are poor byAmerican standards Such a town cannot support a newspaper or thekinds of activity which a newspaper would report78Such poverty in the mountains was not unique to this Italian villageA twentieth century Oxford scholar in Greece said I have met aGreek brought up in this century in a mountain village who had neverseen an olive or a fish or an orange until he was 12 years old79In various mountains in countries around the Mediterranean itwas long common in the past for peasants to rarely eat meat and evencheese was largely confined to a few fortunately situated villages80Bread was the common food for peasants in all three meals of the dayIn earlier times women made clothes for their families and mountainpeople with animals brought those animals inside in cold weather Asa landmark history of Western civilization put it Only the mostprosperous had wooden dividers separating the human from animalquarters81 A traveler through the Bulgarian mountains in 1574 saidthat he preferred to sleep outdoors under a tree rather than inmountain peasants huts where animals and people lived together insuch filth that we could not bear the stench82These broad generalizations do not of course apply to everymountain community everywhere But the general pattern has beenall too true in all too many mountains and highlands around theworld especially in centuries past A twentieth century study of avillage in the Himalayas found that 20 percent of newborn babies diedbefore they were a year old83 Even in prosperous America in theearly twentieth century a sample of farmers in North Carolina showedthat those located in the coastal plains earned three to five times theincome of farmers in mountain counties84Geographic Factors 31An Appalachian county in Kentucky was called a pauper countyin the 1890s and was still in 2010 one of the poorest counties in theUnited States85 The life expectancy of a man in that county was lessthan the life expectancy of a man in Fairfax County Virginia by morethan a decade Womens life expectancy in that same Kentucky countyhad actually declined slightly over a period of 20 years Thepopulation of this county incidentally was 985 percent white86Even in the early twentyfirst century most of the mountain peoplein the world still practiced subsistence agriculture87 The negativeeconomic consequences of mountain life have been accompanied bybroader negative human consequences In many mountaincommunities around the world especially in times past the strugglefor existence caused children to have to work at an early age curtailingtheir education88 and thus isolating them from even secondhandknowledge of the wider world beyond the mountains Illiteracy wascommon among people in mountain communities around theMediterranean on into the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries89Few people from the lands below moved up into the mountains tolive especially in times past and those mountain people who moveddown to the lower elevations encountered a different world one whichthey often found difficult to adjust to and a world in which they wereoften not accepted except perhaps as sojourners for seasonal work Thispattern persisted for centuries In medieval times the Adriatic port ofDubrovnik traded and maintained good relations with the people ofthe hinterland the Vlach shepherds from the mountains but thelatter were not allowed to winter on the territory of the Republic nor toremain within the city90 Such negative reactions to mountain peoplein the lowlands were not peculiar to medieval Europe Similar negativereactions to mountain peoples were common in nineteenth centuryFrance and Morocco and in modern Nepal India and Thailand91There was much the same resistant attitude toward mountain folkin twentieth century America as shown by press reactions when largenumbers of mountain people moved into urban communities32 Wealth Poverty and Politicsexemplified by the reactions of the Chicago Tribune as noted in ascholarly study of migrations from the mountainsThe hillbillies were described as a degenerate population with thelowest standard of living and moral code if any   and the most savagetactics when drunk which is most of

knife The message was clear andintentional these people are worse than the colored92The parallels with blacks go beyond the opinions of others A 1932study of white children from small communities in the Blue RidgeMountains found that these white children not only had IQ scoressomewhat lower than the national average of 85 for black childrenbut also had IQ patterns similar to those of black children such asdoing their worst on abstract questions and having IQs closer to theUS national average of 100 in their early years with a widening gapas they grew older93Another study of mountain children in East Tennessee schools in1930 found similar patterns These children had a median IQ of 82on one test and 78 on another On the test where they did better theirmedian IQ was 95 at age six and declined to 74 by age sixteen Adecade later after social economic and educational improvements inthese East Tennessee communities the median IQ in the sameschools rose to 87694Among those young people from the mountains in the earlytwentieth century who sought higher education at Berea College inKentucky only half returned to their home communities usuallythose who failed to graduate95 The tendency of more able orambitious young people to move down from the mountains while theless able or less ambitious remained or moved farther up into themountains was expressed by a local paradoxical saying that creamsinks and the skim milk rises in the mountains96 In Spain there wasGeographic Factors 33a similar Catalan saying always go down never go up97 Thispattern of an outmigration of young people from mountaincommunities has been a common pattern whether in the UnitedStates or in India or other places around the world98There have also long been seasonal migrants from the mountainswhether the mountainous regions of Spain Nepal South America orSouth Africa99 Remittances from both seasonal and longer termmigrants have played a significant role in supporting families remainingbehind in the mountains100 Longer lasting migrations have includedmany mountain men who became mercenaries in various armies101the Swiss and Scottish highlanders in Europe and the Gurkhas andMontagnards in Asia for example Rifs from North Africa were part ofGeneral Francisco Francos army that won the Spanish civil war andmade Spain a fascist country in the 1930s Over the centuries it hasbeen estimated that perhaps as many as a million Swiss soldiers diedfighting in other countries wars102Despite the largely negative influence of mountains on those wholive in them mountains are often a boon to those on the lands belowAs moistureladen winds collide with mountain slopes these winds areforced upward where the colder air reduces their moisturecarryingcapacity leading to rain and snow It is not uncommon for rainfall onthe windward side of a mountain range to be several times as much asthe rainfall on the other side in what is called the rain shadow of themountains As rain water flows down the mountainsides creatingtrickles of water that join together to form streams these streams inturn join together to create rivers Thus water collected from a widearea of mountain territory is concentrated and delivered as rivers withmany uses to people on the land below All the major rivers of theworld have their beginnings in mountains103Where precipitation in the mountains takes the form of snow thewater is not released all at once but much of it is released later andgradually when this snow melts during warmer weather This meansthat rivers are not solely dependent on the immediate rainfall to keep34 Wealth Poverty and PoliticsGeographic Factors 35flowing because melting snow from the mountains provides water tosustain the rivers during dry periods As with many other things we can see its importance by seeingwhat happens in its absence Although tropical Africa has MountKilimanjaro it has no major mountain ranges comparable to thosefound in Asia Europe or the Western Hemisphere Therefore duringthe dry season in subSaharan Africa rivers and streams shrinkdrastically in the absence of melting snows in the mountains to keepthese waterways supplied with waterMeanwhile the Sierra Nevada Mountains in Spain and the TaurusMountains in Turkey both supply the water that makes a flourishingirrigated agriculture possible in the lowlands104 where rainfall alonewould not be sufficient during the Mediterranean summer when thesun evaporates more water than falls as rain in that region of theworld105Soil and ClimateIt is hard to think of any innovation in the long history of thehuman race that has had a greater impact than agriculture It wassome time within roughly the last 5 percent of the existence of humanbeings that people moved beyond gathering their food from thespontaneous produce of nature or fishing or herding domesticatedanimals and began instead to plant the foods they wanted Virtuallyeverything that we today recognize as civilization dates from thebeginning of agriculture and with it the beginning of citiesExactly how agriculture itself arose is one of those questions whoseanswer is lost in the mists of ancient times But how agriculture cameto the Western world is known It came from the Middle Eastthousands of years ago and apparently originated somewherebetween the Tigris and Euphrates rivers in what is today Iraq Thiswas a geographic setting in which agriculture could not only exist butthrive at the existing level of knowledge at that time The first farmers are unlikely to have known from the outset thatcrops use up nutrients in the soil which have to be replenished if thesoil is to continue to yield crops of the same magnitude But in theland between the Tigris and Euphrates rivers farmers did not have toknow that Annual floods washed new nutrients over the lands asannual floods would also do on the lands along the Nile whereanother great ancient civilization arose in Egypt In Asia agriculture began on the Indian subcontinent in the valleyof the Indus river in what is today Pakistan Despite the arid climatemelting snows from the vast Himalayan mountain range provided theannual flooding which fertilized the land for agriculture Here toosome of the earliest cities were built and some of the earliestcivilizations developed It was much the same story as regards thebeginning of agriculture and civilization in ChinaAgriculture seems to have started in North China in the region of thegreat bend of the Yellow River   In fact this center of early Chinesecivilization resembled in some ways the homes of other ancientcivilizations the flood plains of the Nile in Egypt the Tigris andEuphrates in Mesopotamia and the Indus in modern Pakistan106Elsewhere the earliest farmers had to move on after farming agiven land a number of years and seeing the successive annual cropsgrow successively smaller as the nutrients in the soil were used upthreatening the food supply on which human survival dependedSome peoples simply waited for nature to restore the fertility of thesoil after they left for other lands to farm while some other peoplesburned the vegetation before moving on thereby providing the newnutrients that would gradually restore fertility as these nutrients wereabsorbed into the soil But between the Tigris and Euphrates riversand along the Nile annual floods could keep the land fertile longbefore human beings figured out what was happening But most otherplaces in the world did not have this windfall gainHere again we see a profound geographic inequality affecting thefates of different peoples very differently That inequality of fertility inthe land has continued on to the present day As already noted the36 Wealth Poverty and Politicsmost fertile soils are neither evenly nor randomly distributed aroundthe world A huge swath of these unusually fertile soils spreads acrossthe vast Eurasian landmass beginning in Eastern Europe andextending into northeastern China In the Western Hemisphere there is a large concentration of theserich soils in the American upper midwestern and plains statesextending into parts of Canada In the temperate zone of SouthAmerica there is another concentration of such soils across Uruguayand in the southern part of Argentina107 But the natural processes bywhich such soils are generated or sustained seem not to be found inthe tropics where soil fertility is seldom comparable The crop yields per acre in tropical Africa are a fraction of the cropyields in China or the United States108 Among the many deficienciesof the soil in subSaharan Africa is that the topsoil is often shallowallowing little space for plant roots to reach deep into the ground fornutrients and water109 Moreover the dryness of much of Africainhibits the use of fertilizers to supply the nutrients missing in thesoil Fertilizers used without adequate water can inhibit rather thanenhance the growth of crops Even in places where there are wetlands in central Africa thesewetlands have not been as often cultivated as wetlands in temperateclimates because dangerous tropical diseases like malaria and riverblindness flourish in tropical Africas wetlands110 Here again it is theinteractions of different geographic features in this case climate soiland disease that can make outcomes very different from what theymight seem from a comparison of individual gross features such aswetlands that occur in different regions of the worldDifferences in rainfall patterns also interact with the soil to makeagriculture more successful in some regions of the world than in othersThe rainfall pattern in subSaharan Africa long dry spells followedby torrential downpours is a major handicap for growing crops inpart because the land is baked hard and dry before the massivedownpours wash away part of the topsoil This whole pattern contrastssharply with the interaction of climate and soil in Western Europe orGeographic Factors 37in the eastern and central parts of the United States where rain fallsmore of less evenly throughout the year largely on fertile soilsWe have noted in Chapter 1 how the interaction between latitudeand the varying warmth of ocean currents makes winter temperaturesin London warmer than in American cities hundreds of miles farthersouth than London Other interactions involving other geographicfactors elsewhere likewise make temperatures very different from whatthey would be if determined by latitude alone or by any other factoralone The highest temperature ever recorded in Asia Africa NorthAmerica or South America has in each case been recorded outside thetropics111 Even though the heat of sunlight is greatest in the tropicsnevertheless the sun shines more hours per day during the summer inthe temperate zones than in the tropics112 allowing a longer dailybuildup of heat Thus cities in the temperate zone such as Athens andSeville in Europe or Las Vegas and Phoenix in the United States havehad higher record temperatures than many cities located in the tropicsincluding some located virtually on the Equator such as Singapore inAsia or Quito Ecuador in South America113Clouds are another interaction with latitude because cloudsintercept sunlight and reflect it back into outer space Thus the manycloudless summer days along the Mediterranean coast of Africa haveproduced higher temperature records in cities located in the temperatezone there such as Algiers Tripoli and Alexandria than in many citiesin tropical Africa even cities very near the equator such as Nairobi orLibreville114 Altitude also affects heat so that the highest temperaturesrecorded in the city of Cuzco located in tropical latitudes in the AndesMountains of South America are much lower than in cities like Parisor New York in the temperate zone115Mountain ranges can also affect the climate of nearby regions byblocking either warm or cold air from those regions In southeasternEurope for example winter temperatures in Sarajevo may be nearly 50degrees colder than temperatures on the Dalmatian coast little morethan a hundred miles away because the Balkan mountains block off thewarm air of the Mediterranean from reaching far inland116 In Asia the38 Wealth Poverty and PoliticsGeographic Factors 39Himalayas block warm air from reaching Central Asia and block coldair from reaching India117While we may legitimately speak in general terms about tropicalclimates temperate climates or arctic climates more specific questionsabout climates in specific places such as cities must take into accountthe interactions of particular combinations of factors peculiar toparticular locales More generally interactions within and betweengeographic cultural political and other factors are necessary tounderstand economic and social outcomesMany have tried to explain the fact that countries in the temperatezones are generally far more advanced economically than countries inthe tropics by the energydraining heat in the tropics or by the manydiseases that flourish there whose microorganisms are killed off bycold winters in the temperate zones We have also seen that the mostfertile soils are seldom found in the tropics Nevertheless manypeople from outside the tropics have gone to live in the tropics andprospered there often far more so than the indigenous populationsThe overseas Chinese minority in Southeast Asia and the Lebaneseminority in West Africa are striking examples The British who settled in Australia are perhaps an even morestriking example since they became the majority population of thecountry and about 40 percent of Australia is in the tropics People ofJapanese Chinese and European ancestry are a major part of thepopulation of tropical Hawaii and are prospering there Ordinarily it might be expected that people indigenous to a givengeographic setting would be better able to make the most of thatsettings opportunities and better able to cope with its disadvantagesthan people from a very different setting Yet the evidence seems tosuggest the opposite But as we have seen in other contextsgeographic environments affect people not only by the directeconomic benefits or handicaps of those environments but also by theextent to which those environments facilitate or restrict thedevelopment of the knowledge skills experiences habits andvalues the human capital of the people themselvesIf the geographic settings of the temperate zones foster the kind ofhuman capital that promotes prosperity in whatever climate peoplelive then it is not so surprising that peoples transplanted fromtemperate to tropical climates prosper more in those climates than thepeople indigenous to the tropics As a noted geographer observedparticular cultures may thrive in regions where they could never haveoriginated118What cultural consequences of life in the temperate zones mightbe valuable in other regions that were unlikely to produce suchculturesThe most striking social difference between living in the temperatezones and living in the tropics is not simply the difference in averagetemperatures The lifethreatening challenge that dominated thetemperate zones of the world for millennia was growing enough foodduring the limited spring and summer months to last through thecold winter months It was an inescapable necessity for sheer physicalsurvival to begin plowing or otherwise breaking up the land forplanting when the ground thawed in the spring This meant that peoples living where seasons changed drasticallyhad to develop a sense of urgency about time and the discipline toadjust to its requirements qualities that were not nearly so necessaryin places where food could be grown year round in addition to theavailability of much food spontaneously supplied by nature in manytropical lands The other inescapable necessity of the temperate zones whereseasons are so different was saving food to store for the winter Thisrequired not only the discipline of saving but also the conversion ofperishable foods like milk and fruit into storable foods like cheese andjam Here again this was not such a pressing necessity in the tropicsMoreover tropical foods such as bananas and pineapples were not asstorable in a hot climate as wheat or potatoes were in a cooler climateModern economic and technological conditions have so freed usfrom having to consider such things that it is easy to overlook howimperative those things were for physical survival in the millennia40 Wealth Poverty and Politicsbefore humans were able to transport vast amounts of food over greatdistances or to have refrigerators and freezersMuch has been made of the fact that the Incas created a moresophisticated civilization than most of those indigenous to placeselsewhere in the tropics However the climate in which the Incacivilization developed was not typical of either the tropics or thetemperate zones Not only does the highest daily high temperature forany month average 73 degrees in Cuzco the former capital of theIncas the lowest daily high temperature for any month averages 68degrees Despite very little change in daily high temperatures duringthe course of a year there is a rainy season and a dry season withvariations in precipitation ranging from a monthly average of 5mm inJune to 163mm in January In addition overnight temperatures rangedown to freezing levels in winter119Because of differences in rainfall and differences in overnighttemperatures in different times of the year there were differentseasons when particular crops could be grown even thoughagriculture in general was a yearround activity In short while theclimate in which the Inca Empire arose was not typical of either thetropics or the temperate zone its highly variable growing seasons fordifferent crops120 did present the same inescapable challenge faced byinhabitants of the temperate zones namely the discipline ofconforming ones life to a time frame dictated by the seasonallychanging conditions in agriculture With the high altitudes of the Andes Mountains offsetting the heatof tropical sunshine the empire of the Incas was tropical only in thenarrowest sense of being located between particular lines on a mapANIMALSThe geography of the Western Hemisphere is in many ways muchlike the geography of Western Europe especially in the generous supplyof rivers and harbors in the United States as well as vast level plainsGeographic Factors 41and in New England rich fishing regions offshore in the Atlantic Yetthe indigenous cultures of the Western Hemisphere were very differentfrom the cultures of Western Europe This might seem to suggest that geography has had little or noinfluence on the economic fate of peoples However we need to recallyet again that it is the interactions of various geographic factors that arecrucial to economic and social outcomes What was totally lackingthroughout the Western Hemisphere when the Europeans arrived werehorses oxen and other heavyduty draft animals or heavyduty beasts ofburden During the millennia before motorized vehicles were inventedhorses were crucial to everything from transportation to farming towarfare in Europe Without horses or oxen the evolution of the wholeEuropean economy and society would have had to be radically differentAnd without such heavyduty draft animals or heavyduty beasts ofburden as existed in Europe or the camels water buffalo or elephantselsewhere the economies and societies throughout the WesternHemisphere were in fact radically different from those in Europe The economic and cultural repercussions reached furtherNowhere in the Western Hemisphere were there wheeled vehiclesAlthough the wheel has often been regarded as a landmark in thetechnological progress of the human race the value of wheeledvehicles depended greatly on the availability of draft animals to pullsuch vehicles The Mayans created wheels but they were used onchildrens toys The issue is not the intellectual capacity to invent thewheel but the economic value of wheels in the absence of animals topull vehicles during the millennia before motorized transport The lack of heavyduty draft animals or heavyduty beasts ofburden on land even affected what was economically feasible in watertransportation At the time of the arrival of Europeans in the WesternHemisphere nowhere in North America or South America werethere boats as large as the ships of Europeans much less the evenlarger ships that the Chinese had developed earlier The economicviability of large ships depends on the availability of means of42 Wealth Poverty and Politicsefficiently collecting large enough cargoes on land both from theimmediate ports and from the hinterlands to fill such ships beforea voyage and an ability to efficiently disperse large cargoes at thedestination port and into its hinterlands A complete absence of animals capable of carrying out such taskslimits the size of vessels that are economically viable Waterbornecommerce in the Western Hemisphere as of the time of the arrival ofEuropeans was conducted in smaller vessels such as canoes What this meant was that the indigenous populations of NorthAmerica and South America had both a smaller economic universeand a smaller cultural universe than that of peoples in Europe Asia orNorth Africa Not only could exotic goods travel thousands of milesacross the Eurasian landmass they could also travel thousands ofmiles across water in large ships These imports included many things that originated in Asiapaper printing gunpowder the compass rudders stirrups spaghettichess and a numbering system that Europeans called Arabicnumerals because they first saw these numerals in use among theArabs even though the numerals actually originated in India Allthese things created in Asia became part of the cultural universe ofEuropeans Much knowledge from the Middle East and North Africaalso found its way into Europe including the agricultural andarchitectural advances that the North African Moors brought withthem when they invaded and conquered SpainWhen the British confronted the Iroquois on the east coast ofNorth America the mental and material resources at the disposal ofthese two races were by no means confined to what they had eachdeveloped themselves The British had been able to navigate across theAtlantic in the first place by using the compass invented in Chinadoing mathematical calculations with a numbering system from Indiasteering with rudders invented in China writing on paper invented inChina using letters created by the Romans and ultimately prevailingin combat using gunpowder also invented in China Geographic Factors 43The cultural universe matters and animals have been among thereasons for large disparities in the size of the cultural universe indifferent geographic settings The relative cultural handicaps of theindigenous peoples of the Western Hemisphere were not uniqueSimilar handicaps among others restricted the cultural universe of thepeoples of subSaharan Africa and still more so the cultural universeof the aboriginal population of Australia A common handicap of lagging groups around the world has beenisolation whether in mountain valleys on islands far from the nearestmainland or living where deserts obstruct access to the rest of theworld A dearth of animals also contributes to the isolation of peoplesliving in the same environment often physically not very far from eachother who nevertheless may have relatively little communicationIn addition to having impediments to communication with theoutside world the peoples of subSaharan Africa have had majorimpediments to communication with each other The dearth ofnavigable waterways was just one of those impediments The presenceof rift valleys and jungles also fragmented many of the indigenouspeoples The dearth of beasts of burden due to the tsetse fly thatflourishes in much of tropical Africa and carries a disease deadly toanimals completes the impediments to local transportation andcommunication The colorful African custom of people carryingbundles on their heads is a painful sign of a grim reality where thereare few beasts of burden like horses or camels which can carry muchmore freight much more efficiently Another of the cultural factors fragmenting the peoples in tropicalAfrica is a multiplicity of languages out of all proportion to the sizeof the population  Although Africans are only about 50 percent morenumerous than Europeans they have nine times as many languages asEuropeans Africans have about 90 percent as many languages asAsians who outnumber them nearly four to one121 Linguisticdiversity is not only a sign of cultural isolation and fragmentation itcontributes to the barriers separating African peoples from each otheras well as from the outside world 44 Wealth Poverty and PoliticsGeographic Factors 45Isolation has not been absolute either in the Western Hemisphereor in subSaharan Africa but cultural universes have not been at allcomparable in size to those in much of Europe Asia or North AfricaAn even more severe isolation in an even more geographicallyunpromising environment was the fate of the aboriginal population ofAustralia before the Europeans arrived there in the eighteenth centuryBeasts of burden were even more completely lacking in Australiathan in subSaharan Africa or in the Western Hemisphere beforeEuropeans arrived there Such animals were totally nonexistent inAustralia when the British arrived in the eighteenth century just asthey were nonexistent in most of the Western Hemisphere whenEuropeans arrived there in the fifteenth century though there were atleast llamas in the Andes where they were used as pack animals122However llamas were not large enough to be ridden like horsesTheir biggest advantage was their ability to function in the rarefiedmountain air where they originatedAustralia had other severe geographic handicaps In the ages beforemodern transportation this vast island continent was isolated in theSouthern Hemisphere far from the mainland of Asia and even moredistant from other inhabited continents Much of the soil of Australiawas of low fertility and much of the interior was a desert Rainfall waseven less reliable in the interior of Australia than in subSaharanAfrica with its long months without rain followed by torrentialdownpours In the vast interior desert of Australia there were yearswithout rain followed by summer downpours123 This was not anenvironment favoring either agriculture or spontaneous vegetationBack in times when it was common to speak more frankly aboutdifferent levels of achievements by different peoples a scholarly study ofworld geography said that blacks in Africa taken as a whole occupy ahigher economic and cultural rank than the black races of Australia andMelanesia124 When the Europeans arrived in Australia in theeighteenth century they found the aborigines lacking iron even thoughiron was used by indigenous peoples in subSaharan Africa more than athousand years earlier and even though Australia had some of theworlds largest iron ore deposits Again the role of geography has notbeen simply as a direct supplier of natural wealth but also and moreimportantly as a facilitator or impediment to a larger cultural universefrom which to gain the knowledge to turn natural resources into wealthThe Australian aborigines likewise lacked a knowledge of animalhusbandry and many kinds of agriculture known to the peoples ofsubSaharan Africa among other peoples in geographic settings withthe physical prerequisites for acquiring or developing such knowledgeBut even during the era of genetic determinism in the early twentiethcentury not everyone attributed the lags of the Australian aboriginesto genes The aborigines lack of knowledge of things known to othersaccording to a geographic study published in 1911 must beattributed to their insularity such as was also the case among thenative Canary Islanders125 who are classified as Caucasian bysome126 The fundamental problem of the Australian aborigines wasseen as the geography of Australia the classic ground ofretardation127 shielding the interior tribes especially from externalinfluences and leaving them with the most primitive customs andbeliefs128This isolation applied to animals as well as human beings None ofthe animals of Asia the next nearest continent was present inAustralia when the British arrived in the eighteenth century129Animals that were common in other parts of the world such as bearsmonkeys hoofed animals and the various kinds of cats from housecats to lions and tigers were also nonexistent in Australia130 likethe cattle sheep and goats already mentioned Nor were such Australian animals as kangaroos or koalas indigenouselsewhere Most of the trees in Australia were of the Eucalyptus familywhich is indigenous nowhere else Many kinds of plants birds andfreshwater fish were also unique to Australia To a remarkable extentAustralia was for millennia its own separate world biologically The isolation of the island continents flora and fauna gives some ideaof the isolation of its human beings But the same conclusion is46 Wealth Poverty and Politicsreinforced by genetic studies of the aborigines which indicate thatunlike most other races they had little or no racial intermixture untilhistorically recent times131 Multiple evidences point toward an isolatedland and an isolated people There was similar evidence of prolongedisolation in the Canary Islands where there were hundreds of plantsunique to those islands132 and a backwardness similar to that of theAustralian aborigines though the two groups are racially different andlocated thousands of miles apartIn Australia as in the Western Hemisphere the arrival ofEuropeans led to the transplanting of European animals and evenmore important the transplanting of European knowledge gatheredfrom vastly larger geographic regions forming a far larger culturaluniverse than that available to the indigenous population of AustraliaEuropeans largely avoided the huge interior desert of Australia andsettled primarily around the coastal fringes of the continentconcentrated in cities that could be supplied with food from advancedagricultural practices developed elsewhere and from domesticatedanimals brought from Europe cities that would not have beenviable for huntergatherers such as the aborigines The low fertility of much Australian soil was compensated by thepresence of rich natural resources including not only iron ore but alsotitanium ore of which Australia became the worlds leadingexporter133 But what were natural resources for the Europeans werenot natural resources for the Australian aborigines lacking exposureto the scientific knowledge developed over the centuries in a culturaluniverse extending across the vast Eurasian landmass and includingthe Middle East and North Africa DISEASESEuropeans knew of the existence of Africa thousands of yearsbefore they learned of the existence of the Western Hemisphere YetEuropean empires were established in the Western HemisphereGeographic Factors 4748 Wealth Poverty and Politicshundreds of years before the scramble for Africa began in the latenineteenth century and led to European colonial empires thatextended throughout the continent Diseases had much to do with thediffering fates of these different regions of the world Microorganismsthat most of the humans involved knew nothing about at the timewere on the side of the Europeans during their conquests in theWestern Hemisphere But those microorganisms were on the side ofthe indigenous peoples in tropical AfricaThe much larger cultural universe of the Europeans compared tothat of the peoples of the Western Hemisphere meant a much largerdisease universe as well Diseases endemic in Asia repeatedly madetheir way to Europe along with the goods traded across thousands ofmiles on the Eurasian landmass and by seaborne trade as well Thisinternational commerce transmitted diseases from Asia creatingepidemics in Europe that from time to time wiped out significantfractions of the European population from a third to a half of thepopulation in parts of Europe during the bubonic plague of thefourteenth century134 But the survivors of these devastatingincursions of diseases from Asia developed biological resistance tothese diseases in addition to having biological resistance to diseasesoriginating in Europe When European and indigenous races confronted each other inthe Western Hemisphere whether in battle or in peace themicroorganisms that neither of them knew about decimated theindigenous peoples while the Europeans were not nearly asvulnerable to the diseases of the Western Hemisphere Once European diseases took root in the indigenous populationsthese diseases spread through whole native societies to people whohad no direct contact with Europeans When Pizzaros army wasmarching toward the capital of the Incas people who had never seena European were dying of European diseases inside that capital135 Itwas said of a kindly Spanish priest who went among the nativepeoples of the Western Hemisphere in friendship as a missionarythat he was probably responsible for more deaths among them thanGeographic Factors 49even the most brutal conquistador136 It was not uncommon in partsof the Western Hemisphere for half or more of a given tribe ofindigenous people to be wiped out by European diseases to whichthey had no biological resistanceIn subSaharan Africa the tropical diseases were so deadly tooutsiders that at one time the average life expectancy of a white manin tropical Africa was said to be less than one year Only after medicalscience reached the point where it could cope with deadly tropicaldiseases by either curing them or preventing them by public healthmeasures was it feasible for Europeans to establish empires in subSaharan Africa The swiftness with which these conquests wereaccomplished suggests that the human defenders in tropical Africawere not nearly as formidable as the unseen microorganisms that hadheld European conquerors at bay for centuries Yet again a givenenvironment does not determine a fixed outcome because of itsinteractions with changing human knowledge in this case medicalknowledgeNorth and south of the tropics the situation was very different inAfrica Europeans began settling in what is now the Republic of SouthAfrica the great majority of which is in the temperate zone of theSouthern Hemisphere in the middle of the seventeenth century Inancient times the Romans incorporated much of North Africa in thetemperate zone of the Northern Hemisphere within their empireThere being no decisive disease barrier between Europeans and NorthAfricans around the Mediterranean conquests went each way indifferent periods of history The North African Moors invaded andconquered Spain during what were the Middle Ages in Europe andretained control of Spain for centuries leaving behind both physicaland cultural remains of the society they created during their reignCenturies later Napoleon said Africa begins at the Pyrenees themountain boundary between Spain and FranceAmong the peoples of tropical Africa diseases contributed to theirisolation from each other by their devastating effects on animals thatmight otherwise have become beasts of burden or draft animals thatcould have helped connect different peoples as well as playing usefulroles in agriculture LOCATIONLocation is a significant geographic factor even aside from theparticular characteristics of the location itself For the ancient Greeksto be located near where agriculture developed in the Middle Eastgave them historic opportunities that they used to make historicintellectual contributions to Western civilization and the world For the islands of Japan to be located where China was readilyaccessible across water meant that the Japanese had access to acivilization that for centuries was in the forefront of human advancesand thus Japan could for example adapt Chinese writing to make theirown language a written language This meant that the Japanese had anopportunity to become literate centuries before other peoples in Asiaor elsewhere who were not located near a more advanced civilizationNor did small isolated communities have the same incentives fordeveloping writing themselves as larger more widespread societies withnumerous commercial and other interactions taking place at distancestoo great for verbal communication alone The advantages of coastal peoples over inland peoples or theadvantages of peoples on the plains over peoples living in mountainsare advantages conferred by the simple fact of location and areadvantages common around the world During the era of massimmigration from Europe to the United States Polish immigrantsfrom Russia or from Austria Poland itself having been absorbed intothese empires were almost always unskilled workers but thoserelatively few Polish immigrants who did have specialized work skills asweavers tailors or cabinet makers were predominantly from Prussia137where they acquired such skills from being located in a German culture During the era of European colonialism location near Westerninstitutions like schools gave those segments of the conquered people50 Wealth Poverty and Politicsin such locations major advantages over their compatriots In colonialCeylon for example British missionaries set up schools in morefavored portions of the island nation while the British authoritiesassigned American missionaries to the less favored northern tip of theisland where the Tamil minority was concentrated But because theAmerican missionary schools concentrated more in science andmathematics the Tamils became more proficient in these fields andbetter represented in occupations requiring such training A studyfound that members of the Tamil minority received a majority of theAs on university entry exams138In Nigeria the Ibos lived in the poorly endowed southern part ofthe country and had once been slaves but they seized uponopportunities provided by Western missionary schools while theMuslim peoples of the north rejected schools run by Christianmissionaries The Ibos rose to such professional administrative andbusiness occupations as were open to Africans far more so than thepeoples in northern Nigeria and dominated such occupations evenin northern NigeriaThe location of the United States insulated by two oceans from thewars that ravaged Europe and Asia enabled the American people todevelop their own way of life in relative peace using the culture that haddeveloped in Europe without having to suffer the devastating wars thattheir European ancestors and contemporaries had to endure Bycontrast Mediterranean islands like Sicily and Malta were located inthe path of contending nations and empires that for centuries foughteach other over and on the territory of these islands leaving behind alegacy of destruction conquest and both culturally and geneticallyaltered populations While Britain is an island even closer to the nearest continent thanvarious islands in the Mediterranean it has not been located in thecrossfire between contending empires Moreover the rough waters ofthe English Channel have been more of an obstacle to conqueringinvaders than the calm waters of the Mediterranean Geographic Factors 51Nothing provides absolute protection of course After all Britainwas invaded and conquered by the Romans in ancient times and bythe Normans nearly a thousand years later But after eventuallybecoming a unified and advanced nation in the wake of the Normanconquest of 1066 Britain has not been invaded in nearly anotherthousand years since then What the English Channel has also doneduring that time has been to make it unnecessary for Britain tomaintain a large standing army like those of nations on the continentof Europe sparing the British both the expense and the politicaldangers of large standing armiesLocation has mattered not only for Britain as a whole but also forits internal constituents Being located near enough to continentalEurope to have ready access to the trade and technology of itsEuropean neighbors allowed the British to gain the benefits of thosecontinental nations that were for centuries more advanced than theBritish These advantages were most beneficial to England the closestpart of Britain to the European coast These advantages passed witha lag to other parts of the British Isles Scotland Wales andIreland as did the further advantages when England began tosurpass its continental neighbors and lead the world into theindustrial revolutionLike other geographic features location is not egalitarian The fateof whole races nations and civilizations can depend on whether theyhappen to be located in the right place at the right time or in thewrong place at the wrong time Moreover what was the right place orthe wrong place has varied greatly over the centuries 52 Wealth Poverty and PoliticsChapter 3CULTURAL  FACTORSIf we learn anything from the history ofeconomic development it is that culturemakes almost all the difference Witness theenterprise of expatriate minorities theChinese in East and Southeast AsiaIndians in East Africa Lebanese in WestAfrica Jews and Calvinists throughoutmuch of Europe and on and on Yet culturein the sense of the inner values and attitudesthat guide a population frightens scholarsDavid S Landes1Geography is an influence but not predestination Much of theinfluence of geography on income and wealth derives from itseffects on the size of the cultural universe available to differentpeoples in different physical settings An enumeration of places withrich concentrations of natural resources such as oil in Saudi Arabia orgold in South Africa would be a very poor guide to places with highincomes per capita As The Economist magazine said of Nigeria in2014 it is rich in oil reserves but otherwise desperately poor2Without the cultural prerequisites for developing natural resourcesinto real wealth the raw physical resources themselves are of little orno value The natural resources we use today were even moreabundant in the era of the cave man but the people of that prehistoricera were culturally not yet able to make use of most of those resources 53Even physical capital is of little or no use without the culturalprerequisites to operate it maintain it repair and replace it as it wearsout Conversely the mass destruction of physical capital as inWestern Europe during World War II was followed by an economicrecovery in a relatively few years This recovery has often beencredited to aid from the United States under the Marshall Plan Butsubsequent efforts to promote similar economic development in theThird World with transfers of both financial and physical capital tothe governments of these countries over a long period of decadeshave failed repeatedly to produce anything comparable The difference is that the cultural prerequisites the humancapital which produced the physical capital in Western Europebefore the war survived the war and could produce it again But thatparticular human capital which developed over the centuries inWestern Europe did not exist on the same scale in the Third Worldand could not be created overnight or even over several decades insocieties with a very different set of cultures Third World countries were not being asked to recreate their ownsocieties after some calamity They were being asked to create aWestern economy without the centuries of the particular culturalevolution that led up to those economies in the WestCULTURE  AND  ENVIRONMENTWhen we try to explain differences in economic and otherachievements between nations races or civilizations some argue thatthese differences are due to innate genetic differences in mentalpotential3 and others argue that differences are due to theenvironments in which people live Both seem to assume that all thecauses of differences in achievements fall into just two categoriesheredity and environment In fact these terms are often simplydefined that way so that whatever is not hereditary is calledenvironmental But does this mean that for those who reject genetic54 Wealth Poverty and Politicsdeterminism a groups position in American society is determined byfactors peculiar to American society for which American society cantherefore be praised or blamed as the case may be A vast amount of evidence from around the world suggestsotherwise There are many groups with a particular culture of theirown who take that culture with them wherever they go to live inculturally very different kinds of societies Germans for example havefor centuries had both a very specific set of skills and a very specificway of life whether they lived in Germany Australia Brazil Russiaor the United States Cultures include not only customs values andattitudes but also skills and talents that more directly affect economicoutcomes and which economists call human capitalAmong the skills in which Germans have excelled has been thebuilding of pianos The first pianos in colonial America were built byGermans who also led the way in building pianos in AustraliaFrance Russia and England4 The worlds leading optical firmsdesigning camera lenses in the first half of the twentieth century wereGerman including Zeiss Schneider and Voigtlnder and theleading optical firm in the United States was created by two Germanimmigrants named Bausch and Lomb Germans have likewise excelled in military skills literally formillennia There were German generals in the Roman legions as wellas German generals in czarist Russia5 and in South America6 TheUnited States had German generals in the Revolutionary War of1776 and American armies fighting in Europe in both World War Iand World War II were commanded by generals of Germanancestry Pershing and Eisenhower respectively Other top commanders of American military forces in World WarII who were of German ancestry included Admiral Chester Nimitzwho commanded the Pacific fleet and General Carl Spaatz whosebombers reduced much of Germany to rubble During the MiddleAges the Teutonic Knights conquered Prussia which became theheartland of German military prowess for centuries to come In bothCultural Factors 55World Wars the armies of Germany inflicted far more casualties onopposing forces than the Germans sustained themselves7Social patterns among Germans likewise appeared not only inGermany but also in other countries around the world in culturalenvironments that differed radically from one another An emphasison education was a cultural pattern found in Germany itself wherekindergartens originated and where research universities weredeveloped that were later imitated in the United States Nineteenthcentury Germany was one of the first European nations to have freeand compulsory education as well as more teachers per capita than inmany other European countries and with a higher proportion of thenational output being devoted to education8This emphasis on education was also part of the culture of Germansliving in other countries including countries where the culture of themajority population had no such commitment to education The greatmajority of Germans living in nineteenth century Russia for examplewere literate at a time when the great majority of Russians wereilliterate9 In German farming communities pioneering in thewilderness in nineteenth century Brazil schools appeared in the firstclearings in the woods10 while most nativeborn Brazilians remainedilliterate on into the early twentieth century11 In the Austrian Empirein 1900 the illiteracy rate among German males over the age of tenwas 5 percent while it was 45 percent among Polish males 67 percentamong SerboCroatian males and 71 percent among Romanian malesin that empire12When Czernowitz University was established in nineteenthcentury Romania there were more German students than Romanianstudents and most of the professors were German13 In Estonia auniversity established in 1802 by the czarist government of theRussian Empire had a majority of Germans among its students andfaculty for most of the nineteenth century14 In the city of Riga inadjoining Latvia most of the education was conducted in the Germanlanguage even though Germans were no more than onefourth of thecitys population1556 Wealth Poverty and PoliticsGermans are just one of the groups who have taken their ownparticular culture with them when they immigrated to other societiesso that the general environments of those various other societies werenot the controlling factor in these groups economic or otheroutcomes in those societies How we define environment is crucialIt is not simply a matter of semantic preferences If we defineenvironment as simply the surrounding circumstances then we areleft unable to account for different cultural groups having verydifferent outcomes in the same environment creating among otherthings disparities in income and wealth To account for radical differences in income and wealth amonggroups living in the same society environment can be defined as whatis going on around a group while culture means what is going onwithin each group If we choose instead to define environment as allnongenetic factors then the various cultures of different groups in agiven society are included in the environment of that society Butwhat we cannot do is go back and forth between different conceptionsof what environment means not if we expect to reach consistent orrational conclusionsMany other groups besides Germans have had their own respectivecultures which they take with them into very different settingsaround the world These would include the overseas Chinese invarious Southeast Asian countries and in the Western Hemisphere16the Lebanese in West Africa Australia and North and SouthAmerica17 Jews in Europe the Middle East the WesternHemisphere and Australia18 and the various peoples of India onevery inhabited continent19 Given the cultural differences that these groups take with themwherever they go there is no reason whatever to expect them to havethe same incomes or wealth either compared to each other orcompared to the existing populations of the countries to which theyimmigrate Nor do the empirical data show any such equality Thatthis is a matter of culture rather than a matter of initial wealth uponarriving in a given country is shown by how many groups have arrivedCultural Factors 57in various countries far poorer than the existing population of the hostcountry and have nevertheless eventually risen above the economiclevel of those who were there before themThe histories of the overseas Chinese in the countries of SoutheastAsiaas well as in the United States are classic examples ofimmigrants whose first wave arrived with little more than the clotheson their backs and a willingness to work as hard as it took for them toget ahead Often in centuries past these povertystricken emigrantsfrom China had little or no education and knew little of the languageor customs of the countries they went to Seldom did the laws or practices of the Southeast Asian countriesin which the Chinese settled offer them equal rights with eithermembers of the colonial ruling race or with the indigenous populationIn colonial Malaya for example the British provided schools for thechildren of the Malays but the Chinese had to provide their own20 Innineteenth century America a long and painfully tragic story can besummarized by saying that the Chinese were treated even worse thanin Southeast Asia21 In Peru guards were posted on an island whereChinese contract laborers were assigned the task of shovelling birdmanure into sacks for export as fertilizer working under stifling heatand stench The guards were not there to prevent escape from theisland but to prevent the ultimate escape of suicide22The desperate situation of the Chinese in various other countries inthe nineteenth century also led to high rates of suicide among themThese suicides sometimes began in the Portuguese port of Macao onthe coast of China23 where many Chinese had been lured or trappedinto holding pens for the semislave trade of indentured laborers to beshipped to other countries around the world including hundreds ofthousands to the Western Hemisphere Despite being mostly youngmen in the prime of life a majority of those sent to Cuba died underthe brutal working conditions there before completing the eight yearsof their labor contracts24 In nineteenth century Cuba there were yearswhen more than a hundred Chinese committed suicide25 butthousands more were simply worked to death 58 Wealth Poverty and PoliticsAlthough most Chinese immigrants to the United States in thenineteenth century did not come through the Macao indentured labortrade circumstances in the United States were sufficiently dire thatthe suicide rate of the Chinese in San Francisco as late as the midtwentieth century was nearly three times the national average26Over the years and generations Chinese in the United States havebecome prosperous overcoming many obstacles of which thosecreated by others have not been the only ones The initial poverty andlack of education of Chinese immigrants to nineteenth centuryAmerica was another problem they had to overcome and did Butpoverty has also been a problem for hundreds of thousands of newChinese immigrants arriving as late as the twentyfirst centurywhether legally or illegally from Fujian province in China Like other immigrants in other times and places the Chinese fromFujian have not scattered randomly across the United States but haveconcentrated in their own communities located in this case inBrooklyn New York These Fujianese have been described as reallypoor as in fourpeopletoasingleroom allricediet

piecework on garments29Despite the Jews long tradition of reverence for learning and thespectacular proliferation of worldclass Jewish intellectuals in thenineteenth and twentieth centuries the initial rise of EasternEuropean Jews in America was not through education Although mostJews who arrived in the United States in the early twentieth centurywere literate in some language that did not mean that they were literatein English As a detailed study of these immigrants pointed out theirliteracy in Yiddish or Hebrew might serve as an index of participationin Jewish culture but it was not a language tool widely applicablewithin the context of economic adjustment in the United States30A 1911 study showed that twothirds of the children of Polish Jewswere behind the grade level they were supposed to be in according toage31 During the First World War so many American soldiers ofPolish and Russian ancestry most of them Jews scored so low onthe US Armys mental tests that testing pioneer Carl Brighamcreator of the Scholastic Aptitude Test declared that the Army testresults tended to disprove the popular belief that the Jew is highlyintelligent32Years later after more Jews in America acquired more knowledgeof English and their mental test scores rose above the nationalaverage33 Brigham recanted his earlier conclusions He pointed outbelatedly that many of the Jewish soldiers tested in the First WorldWar came from homes where English was not the language spokenHe characterized his earlier conclusions as in his own wordswithout foundation34Although it was not through education that Jews first rose inAmerican society nevertheless having risen in business whether to60 Wealth Poverty and Politicsa modest or a greater extent the Jewish immigrants then pushedtheir children on to educational achievements which set the stage fortheir rise in the professions as physicians attorneys and the like It should also be noted that neither in the medical nor the legalprofession did Jews find all the doors of opportunity open to themJewish doctors and lawyers could go into private practice whether inJewish or Gentile communities but they were kept out of manyhospitals and leading law firms In the academic world there werequota limits on how many Jewish students would be admitted tovarious colleges and universities and Jewish professors were a rarityuntil after the Second World War Nevertheless when the barriersbegan coming down over the years the Jewish population had abacklog of fully qualified people ready to enter those institutions andeven become disproportionately

replies for them36 Most of the earliest Lebanese immigrants toAustralia were illiterate37 So were most of the early Lebaneseimmigrants to West Africa38In the African nation of Sierra Leone the Creoles looked down onthe Lebanese immigrants because they were uneducated and poorBut the Lebanese did not remain that way long and then theCreoles contempt turned to resentment and hostility when theLebanese became successful in business39Cultural Factors 61Like other immigrants in other countries around the world theLebanese did not emigrate from random locations in their homelandnor settle randomly in the nations to which they moved The vastmajority of the early Lebanese immigrants who arrived in SierraLeone after the First World War came not from cities like Beirut butfrom villages where they had been peasants or similarly low levelworkers40 In short they came from very narrowly specific geographiclocations within Lebanon and settled in very narrowly specificlocations in Sierra Leone the Shiite Muslims in one area theOrthodox Christians concentrated in a different location theMaronite Christians from one part of Lebanon in another locationand the Maronites from another part of Lebanon in still a differentlocation41 Peoples behavior is no more random than geographicfeatures despite how often intellectuals and others regard nonrandom outcomes as strange if not suspiciousWhether in West Africa North America South America orAustralia Lebanese immigrants typically began as peddlers42sometimes following in the footsteps of Jewish peddlers as inBrazil43 where successful peddlers moved up to other work often asowners of small shops with newer immigrants from the same or othergroups replacing them as peddlers Even such huge and wellknownenterprises as Macys Bloomingdales and Levi Strauss among theJews and Haggar and Farah among the Lebanese began at the levelof the lowly peddler Here as among other groups that rose frompoverty to prosperity dogged perseverance over the years was the key In the United States where largescale immigration from Lebanonbegan in the late nineteenth century most of the early immigrantsincluding women and children began as itinerant peddlers withLebanese peddler networks spreading literally across the country44After a Lebanese peddler became financially able to settle down withhis own store it was usually a family enterprise open 16 to 18 hoursa day with children stocking the shelves and making deliveries andwith wives sometimes relieving their husbands in the store in62 Wealth Poverty and PoliticsCultural Factors 63addition to their other tasks in the home Home was often next doorto the store or upstairs45This pattern was very similar to that among Lebanese in SierraLeone46 as well as among the Chinese in Southeast Asia or Jews inthe United States Milton Friedman was raised in living quarters overhis familys store a pattern that he described as common among theimmigrants to America in that era47 Lebanese children wereinducted into the family business and its requirements at an early ageSchoolage children when not in school were at their parents elbowswaiting on customers making change stocking shelves and imbibingthe shrewdness of operating an independent business on meagreresources They were inculcated with the parents work and thrift ethicsand the lesson that family unity and selfdenial was essential to thefamilys goals48In country after country successive generations of Lebanese movedup step by step Commerce was the occupation of most of the earlyLebanese immigrants whether in Argentina49 Australia50 SierraLeone51 various Caribbean islands52 or the United States53 amongother places But Lebanese success in business later allowed them togive their children more education including education at colleges anduniversities This too happened in a number of countries in which theLebanese settled54 and increasing numbers of new immigrants fromLebanon in later years also arrived already welleducated With the Lebanese as with the overseas Chinese and the Jews whatmattered was not that they first arrived in various countries asimmigrants with very little education but that they came from a culturewhich valued education highly so that once they became financiallyable to do so they saw to it that their children acquired highereducation and thus could expand their horizons from commerce to theprofessions such as medicine law and science as many did The patterns of upward mobility seen among the overseas Chinesethe Jews and the Lebanese are of course not the only patterns ofupward mobility Many Cubans who had been professional andbusiness people in their homeland before Fidel Castro seized control64 Wealth Poverty and Politicsand imposed Communism in Cuba fled to the United States wherethey were concentrated in nearby Florida Unable to take much oftheir physical wealth with them to America and usually unable toresume the same professions they had back in Cuba since theireducational or occupational credentials carried no weight in theUnited States these refugees found themselves suddenly at thebottom economically As one account put it they crammed into smallapartments and became dishwashers janitors and tomato pickers55For the overwhelming majority the story of their success was one ofarduous toil swallowed pride and sacrifice for their children Formerexecutives parked cars judges washed dishes doctors deliverednewspapers Women who had never held jobs before worked asseamstresses hotel maids or shrimp sorters at warehouses by the MiamiRiver work so painful they called it la Siberia As one migr put it Iwas determined that my children would be middle class even if I had tohave two jobs which I did for fourteen years56Yet these Cuban refugees who found themselves at the bottomwhen their exodus began in 1959 had children who by 1990 earnedmore than 50000 a year twice as often as white Americans Fortyyears after these Cuban refugees arrived in the United States the totalrevenue of Cuban American businesses was greater than the totalrevenue of the entire nation of Cuba57 Similarly as late as 1994 the57 million overseas Chinese produced as much wealth as the onebillion people in China58Yet again all this takes us back to the question What do we meanby environment If we mean simply the immediate surroundingsthen it is hard to see why other groups living in the same immediatesurroundings as the Fujian Chinese in New York and on the wholeliving at higher economic levels do not get their children into thecitys elite public high schools as often as the Fujianese do Nor is itobvious why nativeborn white Americans do not have high incomesas often as Cuban Americans do If instead we see environment as including the cultural valuesthat led the Fujianese to make extraordinary sacrifices for theCultural Factors 65education of their children or Cuban American refugees to makesimilarly extraordinary efforts to lift their families up from thebottom then this situation is less puzzling because it is obvious thatnot all groups have these same cultural imperatives But while thismakes the problem of understanding the success of theseextraordinary groups less puzzling it also makes the task of trying toget other groups to do the same far more daunting CULTURAL  DIFFUSION The history of outsiders attempts to change the culture of othershas largely been a history of failure The centurieslong attempts ofChristian Europe to force Jews to change their religion is just oneexample The Czars Russification program likewise created moreresentment than results Yet cultural diffusion has taken place on amassive scale by particular groups races nations and civilizationsborrowing particular cultural features from others for their ownbenefit by their own choices and at their own pacesWestern civilizations replacement of Roman numerals by Arabicnumerals even in countries that were once part of the RomanEmpire and which retained many other features inherited fromRome was a result of voluntary decisions made throughout Westernsocieties without any campaigns of persuasion by Arabs or by thepeople of India where such numbers originated Arabic numeralswere simply better not merely different as multiculturalists mightsay when it came to mathematical operations Just writing the yearof Columbus voyage to the Western Hemisphere in Romannumerals MCCCCXCII shows the cumbersomeness of thesenumbers and mathematicians have other objections The point here is that cultural borrowing has long taken place on alarge scale for largely practical reasons We have already noted themany cultural features of Asia that spread to Europe over the centuriesA similar process of cultural diffusion occurred between differentregions within Europe Among the cultural advances that spread overthe centuries from Western Europe to Eastern Europe were coinscastles crossbows paved streets printing presses power loomsvaccinations railroads and automobiles59 But just as outsidersattempts to force changes in other peoples cultures have largely failedoutsiders attempts to artificially prolong the longevity of a particulargroups cultural features preserving them as if they were museumpieces can be a serious disservice especially to groups lagging behindeconomically or otherwiseNot all groups races nations or civilizations have been equallyreceptive to absorbing cultural advances from others Differences inreceptivity are among the many cultural differences among groups Insome cases however geographic or other handicaps impeding theprogress of a group or a nation have been overcome by absorbingadvances made by more fortunate peoples elsewhere and then usingand improving those advances for their own economic or other benefitJapan was a classic example of a country lacking the geographicadvantages of more fortunate nations that had pioneered historicadvances By contrast with ancient Chinas many outstanding naturalharbors and extensive network of navigable rivers along withunusually fertile land across its northern region Japan was a muchsmaller country with smaller and steeper drainage areas making itsrivers less navigable because their waters flow more steeply and swiftlydown to the sea60 Much of Japan is mountainous with only afraction of the countrys land being level enough for agriculture61Japans largest level plain is only 120 miles long62 In addition thereis a dearth of natural resources in Japan Given these geographic handicaps it is not surprising that Japanlagged for centuries behind the economic level of China during theera of Chinese world leadership in many fields One of Japans fewgeographic advantages has been its accessibility to the sea so that itscoastal areas have been in communication with the outside worldMoreover these coastal areas are a substantial proportion of the total66 Wealth Poverty and PoliticsCultural Factors 67land area of Japan where no part of the country is more than 70 milesfrom the sea63Among other things this meant that the more advanced culture ofChina was physically accessible to Japan for more than a thousandyears More important Japan was culturally receptive to aspects of theChinese culture In addition to adapting Chinese writing to create awritten version of the Japanese language Japan also adopted someChinese philosophical ideas as well as such mundane things as thecultivation of cotton and the technology for spinning and weaving itinto cloth64For more than two centuries however the government of Japancut the country off from much of the outside world From 1638 to1868 emigration from Japan was forbidden on pain of death andJapanese who happened to be abroad at the time of this decree wereforbidden to return According to leading scholars of East Asianhistory The Japanese who had been technologically andinstitutionally abreast of the Europeans in many respects and ahead insome at the start of the seventeenth century fell drastically behind65Isolation took its toll in Japan as it has elsewhereThe historic shattering of Japans barriers against the outside worldcame abruptly in 1853 with the intrusion of Commodore MatthewPerrys American warships into Japan That Perry could sail intoJapanese waters with impunity was one indication of Japans weaknessand backwardness at that time The countrys backwardness wasfurther revealed by the reaction of the Japanese people to a train thatPerry presented as a giftAt first the Japanese watched the train fearfully from a safe distanceand when the engine began to move they uttered cries of astonishmentand drew in their breathBefore long they were inspecting it closely stroking it and riding onit and they kept this up throughout the day66In the years following Commodore Perrys mission Japanesereceptivity to Western culture became extraordinary approachingadulation The United States was singled out for special praise anddepicted as an earthly paradise67 Euphoric depictions of the UnitedStates were part of a general depiction of Western peoples and nationsas enviable and greatAs an indication of the economic level of nineteenth centuryJapan its per capita purchasing power in 1886 was onefortieth ofthat in the United Kingdom though by 1898 this had risen to onesixth68 Japans rise to an economic parity with the leading Westernnations over the next century was achieved by a mass importation ofWestern technology and Western experts to begin teaching thattechnology in Japan while Japanese students were sent overseas tostudy in Western universities While fewer than half of Japanesechildren were going to school in 1886 by 1905 that had risen to 95percent and continued rising69By the beginning of the twentieth century Japans own people hadadvanced to the point where most foreign experts were no longerneeded and were gone70 During the first half of the twentieth centuryJapan was producing many industrial products though much of whatit produced during that era were cheaper imitations of Westernproducts and not of the highest quality However the second half ofthe twentieth century saw the Japanese become pacesetters in both68 Wealth Poverty and Politics There were later reversals of these attitudes in Japan during the early twentiethcentury as fanatical nationalism arose Those Japanese emigrants who went to theUnited States during the earlier proAmerican period largely remained loyal to theUnited States during the Second World War despite having been discriminatedagainst before the war and despite being interned during the war But Japaneseemigrants who went to Brazil during the later nationalistic and antiWesternperiod remained loyal to Japan throughout the war and refused to believe the newsthat Japan had surrendered That Japanese Americans were loyal to the UnitedStates despite being discriminated against and interned while Japanese in Brazilwere loyal to Japan despite being treated better in Brazil than Japanese in the UnitedStates and not being interned suggests again that environment must be defined toinclude the culture originating within the group See Yasuo

striking in photography Howeverthe first Nikon camera was an obvious imitation of a German cameracalled the Contax and the first Canon camera was a copy ofGermanys worldrenowned Leica But as time went on JapansNikon and Canon cameras were developed into standardsetters intheir field and their sales eclipsed the sales of the cameras they hadinitially imitated Japan also produced highspeed trains that eclipsedanything produced in the United StatesAlthough Britain and Japan have been culturally quite different inmany ways they were nevertheless similar in being island nations thatfor centuries lagged behind the progress on the mainland nearestthem that is continental Western Europe and China respectivelyBritain and Japan were also very much alike in having cultures thatwere receptive to absorbing the advances of other nations andeventually developing these advances further eventually surpassingtheir erstwhile superiors Within Britain the Scots likewise absorbed much from theEnglish beginning with the English language and eventually rose tosurpass the English in engineering and medical science71 From thelate eighteenth century through the first half of the nineteenthcentury a disproportionate share of the leading British intellectualsin a variety of fields were of Scottish ancestry These included DavidHume in philosophy Adam Smith in economics Joseph Black inchemistry James Watt in engineering Robert Burns and Sir WalterScott in literature James Mill and John Stuart Mill in economics andpolitics and Robert Adam who was internationally renowned for hisdesigns of everything from palaces to book bindings72 As a notedhistorian put it in every branch of knowledge this once poor andignorant people produced original and successful thinkers73During the Middle Ages Europe as a whole learned much fromthe Islamic world of the Middle East and North Africa especially inmathematics and philosophy but also in agriculture and architectureCultural Factors 6970 Wealth Poverty and PoliticsMilitarily as well the Islamic world was more advanced at that timeThe Ottoman Empire invaded and conquered much of SoutheasternEurope while North African Moors invaded and conquered SpainAs the distinguished British magazine The Economist put it in 2014A thousand years ago the great cities of Baghdad Damascus and Cairotook turns to race ahead of the Western world Islam and innovationwere twins The various Arab caliphates were dynamic superpowersbeacons of learning tolerance and trade Yet today the Arabs are in awretched state74Anyone who doubts the cultural and technological level achievedby the Islamic world a thousand years ago need only visit the greatmosque in Cordoba built when the Moors were the ruling conquerorsof Spain As for tolerance when in 1492 Christian Spain finally freeditself and drove out the last of the Moors it also expelled Jews enmasse more of whom fled to the Islamic world than to ChristianEurope which was at that time less tolerant than Islamic NorthAfrica and the Ottoman Empire That world was obviously quitedifferent from the world of today Part of the difference reflects adifference in receptivity to other culturesEventually the Western world would overtake the Middle Easternand North African countries both militarily and in terms of scienceand technology But now the Islamic countries were by no means asreceptive to the cultural advances made in the Western countries asthe West had once been when the countries of the Middle East andNorth Africa were ascendantOne revealing sign of this lack of cultural receptivity is that intodays Arab world about 300 million people in more than 20countries75 the number of books translated from other languageshas been just onefifth of the number translated by Greece alone fora population of 11 million people Over a fiveyear period a UnitedNations study showed that the number of books translated in theArab world was less than one book for every million Arabs while inHungary there were 519 books translated for every million peopleand in Spain 920 books per million people76 Put differently SpainCultural Factors 71translates more books into Spanish annually than the Arabs havetranslated into Arabic in a thousand years77Cultural isolation can have effects very similar to the effects ofgeographic isolation making it harder for individuals groups nationsor whole civilizations to keep up with the advances of others Chinasdecline from world leadership in many fields was likewise marked byresistance to learning from others Early in the fifteenth century the government of China imposedsevere restrictions on contacts with the outside world destroying thelarge ships in which a Chinese admiral had made voyages ofexploration covering longer distances than Columbus much smallerships Such voyages were now not only forbidden but the building ofships capable of making such voyages was banned and records ofearlier voyages to what were regarded as the lands of foreignbarbarians were destroyed A twentyfirst century American scientistassessed Chinas position as of the time this fateful decision was madeBefore the decision China had a fleet of oceangoing ships bigger andmore capable than any European ships China was roughly level withEurope in scientific knowledge and far ahead in the technologies ofprinting navigation and rocketry As a consequence of the decisionChina fell disastrously behind in science and technology and is onlycatching up now after six hundred years78In the eighteenth century when Englands King George III sentgifts to the emperor of China that included various devices showingtechnological advances in the West the emperor of China replied thatthere was nothing China lacked He said We have never set muchstore on strange or ingenious objects nor do we need any more ofyour countrys manufactures79 A rejection of advances from anotherculture could hardly have been more explicit or more catastrophicas China became ever more vulnerable to Western imperialism as thetechnological gap between the two civilizations widened Since no given culture is better in all things much less for all timea lack of receptivity to the cultural advances made by others is a selfimposed isolation that can be as damaging as isolation imposed bygeographyAnother major factor in cultural isolation among countries aroundthe world is language It has been said that Knowledge travels in thebaggage of languages80 But not all languages contain the sameamount or range of written knowledge The languages of WesternEurope developed written versions centuries before the languages ofEastern Europe because Western Europe was conquered by theRomans and acquired Latin letters as a result This centurieslonghead start in literacy meant that even after the languages of EasternEurope developed written versions they did not instantly acquire therange volume or variety of knowledge available in the languages ofWestern Europe Even though Estonians for example had a written language in thenineteenth century most of what was written in that language duringthe first half of that century was confined to religious subjects But theworking language of educated people in Estonia was Germanwhether a particular individual was of German ancestry or not81 Norwas this situation unique to Estonia Although the Czech languagehad an earlier and wider literature in Bohemia this literature haddeclined by the early nineteenth century and the Czech press at thattime was said to be still in its infancy with a circulation only a fractionof that of the German newspaper in Prague82 Elementary schools forCzech children were taught in their native language but before 1848there was no high school in Bohemia that taught in Czech Toadvance to that level required a child to know German83For many people in Eastern Europe becoming educated forcareers in science or in various professions meant being educated inthe German language Moreover given the prevalence of ethnicGermans in many higher occupations in parts of Eastern Europeentering many elite occupations there often meant acquiring theGerman culture in general to fit in with elite colleagues Many among the rising generation of educated Czechs andLatvians greatly resented having to change their language and culture72 Wealth Poverty and Politicsin order to advance in the world Ethnic Germans of course had nosuch obstacle to overcome so no one could claim that this situationwas fair But the more fundamental question is whether thisunfairness was something inherent in the circumstances of the timeand place or something arbitrarily inflicted on nonGermans inEastern Europe While the argument could be made that Germans ruled theHabsburg Empire and so could be accused of treating other groupsunfairly very similar patterns existed in Romania ruled byRomanians and in Latvia and Estonia then parts of the RussianEmpire ruled by RussiansThe practical question was whether the presence of substantialGerman minorities in various parts of Eastern Europe including boththe Baltic and the Balkans increased or decreased the opportunities ofthe peoples indigenous to that region From an economic standpoint itis clear that culturally German educational institutions were open topeople who were not Germans and so were available sources of humancapital that were not equally available in the languages of theindigenous populations of Eastern Europe Similarly those rural villages in Eastern Europe that were largelypopulated by German farmers were allowed by Eastern European rulersto live under German law allowing both Germans and nonGermansliving in those villages greater freedom than in most of the rest ofEastern Europe84 Moreover the presence of Germans with higherskills than those in the indigenous population benefitted the wholeeconomy providing both additional products and additional jobs for theindigenous population It was precisely the Germans farmers greaterskills and productivity which had prompted Eastern European rulers towelcome them and provide incentives for them to immigrateFrom a political perspective however Germans in Eastern Europewere seen by many Eastern European peoples as an alien elitedominating business and the professions and their culture was seen as abarrier to the indigenous peoples rather than an opportunity to advancethemselves by acquiring the advantages available to them in this foreignCultural Factors 73culture that was not equally available in their own culture at that timeand place But the Latvian intelligentsia for example saw Latvians as apeople consigned by long oppression to lowly stations in life85The situation of the Germans in Eastern Europe was by no meansunique on the world stage Much the same combination of economicadvances and social resentments was created by the presence of theoverseas Chinese minority in such Southeast Asian countries asThailand Vietnam the Philippines Malaysia and Indonesia86 Fewamong the indigenous peoples of these countries sought to acquirethe culture of the overseas Chinese including their willingness towork hard for long hours certainly not as many as resented Chinesedomination in education industry and commerceMuch the same pattern appeared in other countries where eithera foreign minority or a different ethnic group within the samecountry but with a different culture outperformed the local majoritypopulation in educational institutions andor in the economy Thesewould include at various times and places Armenians in theOttoman Empire Ibos in Nigeria Tamils in Sri Lanka Indians andPakistanis in East Africa Japanese in Peru Indians in Fiji Jews inEastern Europe and Lebanese in West Africa among others The political incentives in these and other countries have been todemonize whatever minority outperformed the majority populationoften accusing these minorities of taking over whole industries evenwhen in fact they created industries that had not existed beforeHowever the political mobilization of resentment turned out and insome countries such as Sri Lanka and Nigeria it produced horrificcivil wars this politicizing of group differences operated against areceptivity to human capital available from more successful cultures Often instead politics promoted a sense of grievance against thosewith a more successful culture and a sense of entitlement to somedemographically based fair share of jobs and incomes As an ethnicleader in India expressed it Are we not entitled to jobs just becausewe are not as qualified87 An ethnic spokesman in Nigeria similarlydecried the tyranny of skills8874 Wealth Poverty and PoliticsImplicit in this focus on demographically based fair shares ofeconomic benefits is an assumption that questions about sharing thewealth can be separated from questions about producing that wealth inthe first place But the damage to national economies after theexpulsions of productive minorities suggests otherwise whether it wasthe expulsion of the Asians from Uganda in the 1970s89 the expulsionof the Germans from Czechoslovakia after the Second World War90 theexpulsion of the Moriscos from seventeenth century Spain91 or theexpulsions of Jews from France and various German cities in medievaltimes92Similar economic damage has been done in countries where hostilepolicies by governments or outright violence by mobs led productiveminorities to flee as the Huguenots fled from France in 168593 or asJews fled Eastern Europe in the late nineteenth century94Hostility to more productive minorities who both increase thenational standard of living and provide cultural examples andopportunities for members of the majority population to acquire thehuman capital of a more advanced culture in order to advancethemselves might seem to be irrational But it is quite rational fromthe standpoint of the selfinterest of leaders of lagging groups to keepthe groups they lead resentful of more advanced groups and to blamethose advanced groups for their own groups failure to share more fullyin the economic benefits created by skills and knowledge that are notas prevalent in the lagging groups own culture Looked at differently to the extent that individual members oflagging groups acquire the skills and cultures of more advancedgroups they may be absorbed into these groups or at a minimum feelless need of their own group leaders However economically beneficialvarious aspects of the culture of more advanced groups might be tothe lagging group as a whole the absorption of that culture is a clearthreat to group leaders who see the erosion of the indigenous cultureas the erosion of their own role as leaders and the piecemeal loss oftheir constituency Indeed fear of cultural erosion and ultimatelyCultural Factors 75extinction has been expressed by the leaders and the intelligentsia ofmany lagging groups at various times and places around the world95An eighteenthcentury Czech scholar for example expressed fearsthat the increased use of the German language among fellow Czechsmeant that the next generation will already be German and in fiftyyears more German than Czech will be spoken in the cities ofBohemia96Nor were such fears groundless As a later historian said of that eraCzechspeakers preponderated in Prague only among the lowerclasses and though the Czech language as such was by no meansclose to death it had retreated to the fields the stables and thekitchens where it was spoken by servants and subordinates and wasat this point in history a badge not of nationality but of ignorance97Most servants in Prague during this era were Czech except for anoccasional German nurse or governess Most German households hadservants and most Czech households did not98Halfway around the world in twentieth century Sri Lanka with itsSinhalese Buddhist majority speaking Sinhala and its Tamil Hinduminority speaking the Tamil language the same fear was expressedthat the more successful minority would culturally absorb the lesssuccessful majority over time Sinhala language activists in 1956warned Buddhist priests that if they didnt do something there wouldbe no more Buddhism and no more Sinhalese99It was much the same story in Canadas province of Quebec in the1970s where the Frenchspeaking majority severely restricted by lawthe use of English in many institutions including private businessesThe chief architect of this policy Cultural Development MinisterCamille Laurin declared that French must become the commonlanguage of all Quebeckers As elsewhere this was because of a needfor Frenchspeaking Quebeckers to concern themselves constantlywith their cultural survival and their own inferior economic andpolitical positon100 in Canada Similar fears of cultural extinction forsimilar reasons have been expressed in Fiji Pakistan Malaysia thePhilippines and Burma10176 Wealth Poverty and PoliticsCultural Factors 77Legal restrictions on the use of nonmajority languages that seemalmost inexplicable in their scope and pettiness whether innineteenth century Bohemia or in twentieth century Quebec102 areat least comprehensible as part of the drive by group leaders and groupintelligentsia to prevent the cultural coopting of members of lagginggroups These group leaders and intelligentsia have been trying tostave off the assimilation and absorption of fellow group membersinto economically more advanced groups Today in America blackyoungsters seeking to speak the standard English of the larger societyoften as part of a more general absorption of educational and othercomponents of the larger culture have been accused of actingwhite a charge that can bring anything from ridicule to ostracismto harassment or outright violence from fellow blacks103In short in many times and places there have been many obstaclesto cultural receptivity among lagging groups The enthusiasticembrace of aspects of a different culture by eighteenth century Scotsand nineteenth century Japanese was a rare exception So too was thespectacular rise of Scotland and Japan to the forefront of worldachievements in a remarkably short time as history is measured On a smaller scale various groups within particular nonWesterncountries seized upon educational opportunities presented by thepresence of Western educational institutions during the era ofEuropean colonialism Like the Scots and the Japanese these groupsoften came from regions with geographic handicaps such as soil toopoor for the people in the region to support their growing populationThe Ibos in the southern part of Nigeria and the Tamils in the northernpart of Sri Lanka were among such groups in various times and placesincluding Indonesia Algeria and the Philippines104 Armed withWestern education and other Western cultural advantages the Ibos andthe Tamils spread out to other regions of their respective countriesoutperforming other groups in businesses civil service and theprofessions bringing benefits to the general population and at the sametime stirring resentments of their striking success 78 Wealth Poverty and PoliticsCULTURE  AND  PROGRESSEconomic progress depends upon both tangible physical factorslike geography and intangible cultural factors like human capitalincluding what has been aptly called the radius of trust within whichindividuals and groups cooperate in economic and social endeavorsAttitudes toward work and attitudes toward progress itself are alsoamong the intangibles that combine with tangible factors likegeographic features and physical capital to produce economic endresults What is tangible may make a stronger visible impression butit is by no means certain that its economic effect is greater than theintangibles included in the concept of culture Among the many ways that cultures differ is in the ability ofindividuals and groups to trust and cooperate with one another Theradius of trust differs greatly from one group race nation and civilizationto another and these differences have major implications fordisparities of income and wealth between nations or within nations Trust and HonestyWhile trust permits many mutually beneficial forms ofcooperation trust without trustworthiness is a formula for disasterThe level of honesty in a given society limits the radius of trust in thatsociety and this can have an economic impact that outweighs manytangible advantages of a given societyThe Soviet Union for example was one of the most richlyendowed nations on earth if not the most richly endowed in naturalresources It was one of the few industrial nations with such anabundance of petroleum that it was a major exporter of oil Itcontained soil of legendary fertility and the worlds largest levelplains105 The Soviet Union also had the worlds largest reserves ofiron ore onefifth of all the forested land in the world the worldssecondlargest deposits of manganese106 and onethird of the worldsnatural gas107 in addition to being for many years the worlds leadingCultural Factors 79producer of nickel108 The Soviet Union was selfsufficient invirtually all natural resources and exported substantial amounts ofgold and diamonds As of 1978 it supplied nearly half of theindustrial diamonds in the world109Yet despite all these advantages in natural resources and a welleducated population the Soviet economy was far less efficient thanthe economies of Germany Japan or the United States according toa study by two of its own economists110 The standard of living of theRussian people was significantly lower than that in Western Europethe United States or Japan even though Japan is one of the mostpoorly endowed nations when it comes to natural resources How could a country so richly endowed by nature have a standard ofliving below that of so many other countries with far less in the way ofnatural resources The Soviet Union was almost a tailormade refutationof geographic determinism The other influences at work that offset thecountrys many natural advantages were both cultural and political Backin the nineteenth century when the country was more candidly calledthe Russian Empire John Stuart Mill commented on a culturalhandicap that would impede its economic developmentThe universal venality ascribed to Russian functionaries must be animmense drag on the capabilities of economical improvement possessedso abundantly by the Russian empire since the emoluments of publicofficers must depend on the success with which they can multiplyvexations for the purpose of being bought off by bribes111The cost of corruption in an economy does not consist solely or evenprimarily of the bribes paid the money stolen or the goods pilferedThe main costs consist of the things that are not done the businessesthat are not started the investments that are not made and the loansthat are not granted because the rate of return on such economicactivities would have to be much higher to make such activitiesworthwhile in a very corrupt economy than in an economy in which therisks of being deprived of the fruits of ones efforts were much lowerWhen the czarist government sought to modernize the Russianeconomy in the late nineteenth century and invited Western businessfirms to set up operations in Russia those firms hired Russianworkers and eventually Russians in managerial positions but theymade it a point not to hire Russian accountants Nor were accountantsthe only problem A French observer in the early twentieth centuryreferred to the extraordinary waste to be polite that reignsamong Russian administrators112 As honest as a German and aspunctual as a German113 were once common expressions in Russiasuggesting the rarity of such qualities among Russians themselvesWhy and how these cultural differences came to be what they weremay be lost in the mists of time but the economic importance of suchcultural qualities is plainWidespread corruption in Russia continued even under thedraconian punishments of the Stalinist dictatorship in the days of theSoviet Union Despite punishments that included years in slave laborcamps the Soviet economy had whole classes of people known astolkachi whose sole purpose was to carry out illegal economic activitieson behalf of Soviet economic enterprises that could otherwise find itdifficult to meet the goals set for them by central planners in Moscowwithin the severe limitations of what they were officially allowed to doin the governmentcontrolled economy114The widespread corruption that existed in czarist times persisted inRussia throughout the Soviet era as well as in Russia after thebreakup of the Soviet Union The stock of a Russian oil company wasestimated to sell for about one percent of what the stock of a similaroil company in the United States would sell for because the marketexpects that Russian oil companies will be systematically looted byinsiders115 Bribes of between 10000 and 15000 were required togain admission to some wellregarded institutions of higher learningin Moscow according to a Russian newspaper which estimated thatat least 2 billion a year were paid in such outlays by Russian studentsand their parents116Russia was not unique though its great abundance of naturalresources and low standard of living provides a dramatic example ofhow the benefits of tangible factors can be outweighed by the80 Wealth Poverty and Politicshandicaps created by negative intangible factors Pervasive corruptioncan make the large investments needed to develop natural resourcessimply too risky for either local or foreign investors to take a chanceIn other situations however the radius of trust can allow particulargroups to prosper not only in prosperous countries but even in ThirdWorld countries with unreliable and corrupt legal systems Membersof such groups as the Marwaris in India or subgroups of the overseasChinese in Southeast Asia have been able to engage in financialtransactions with one another without contracts or other recourse tothe legal or political institutions of the larger society That is a specialadvantage in countries where the formal legal system is eitherineffective or corrupt for this gives members of groups with a wideradius of trust among themselves the advantage of being able to makeeconomic decisions faster and with less risk than can other membersof such societiesA high degree of trust within particular groups can also be anadvantage in more advanced economies Hasidic Jews in New Yorkfor example can sell consignments of expensive jewelry for oneanother on the basis of verbal agreements and share the proceedslater on the basis of these informal understandings117 The Marwarisin India have done the same across international trading networks118In Southeast Asia the same phenomenon can be found among subgroups of the overseas Chinese119 and a similar pattern can be foundamong subgroups of Lebanese immigrants in West Africa and inparts of the Western Hemisphere120While a whole society can seldom if ever develop as strong a senseof trust as that among Marwaris Hasidic Jews or subgroups of theoverseas Chinese or Lebanese nevertheless some societies have astrong enough sense of honesty and decency among its people as toenable many useful economic and other activities to take placewithout the heavy costs and risks that restrict such activities in othersocieties Everything from the use of credit cards to the collection oftaxes depends on most people being sufficiently trustworthy so thatrecourse to the forces of the law can be reserved for that segment ofCultural Factors 81the population which lacks the elementary level of trustworthinessrequired for a viable society on a large scaleWhile some theorists may tend to discuss people in the abstractactual fleshandblood human beings differ enormously not just fromindividual to individual but from group to group and from one cultureto another Various tests of honesty reveal very striking differences When a dozen wallets with money and identification in them weredeliberately left in public places in various cities around the world in2013 the number returned with the money still in them varied fromeleven out of twelve in Helsinki to one out of twelve in LisbonMoreover the one that was returned in Lisbon was returned by avisitor from the Netherlands no Portuguese returned any In Rio deJaneiro four were returned121 Earlier international tests of walletswith money in them by the Readers Digest found 67 percent of thesewallets returned with the money still there in the United States 70percent in Stockholm and 100 percent returned in Oslo Norwayand in Odense Denmark In China 30 percent were returned and inMexico it was 21 percent122Similar contrasts among nations were found in a fiveyear study ofwhich United Nations diplomats paid their parking tickets in NewYork City where diplomatic immunity shielded them fromprosecution Egypt with 24 UN diplomats had thousands of unpaidparking tickets during that fiveyear period Meanwhile Canada withthe same number of UN diplomats as Egypt had no unpaid parkingtickets at all during the same fiveyear period Nor did Britain with31 UN diplomats or Japan with 47 UN diplomats123More systematic international studies of corruption have foundthat most of the countries rated as most corrupt were among thepoorest countries even when they had rich natural resources124Honesty is more than a moral issue It is also an economic factorwhose presence or absence can be of major importance Like otherfactors that affect income and wealth it is neither evenly norrandomly distributed among nations or within nations 82 Wealth Poverty and PoliticsHuman CapitalHuman capital is important not just in helping a country recoverfrom devastating losses of physical capital such as after a war It is alsoa major factor in economic progress in normal times Human capitalis in fact the biggest difference between ourselves and the cave manThere is a tendency by some to equate human capital witheducation No doubt education is one of the varieties of humancapital While years of education are often used as a rough proxy forhuman capital in general not only is much human capital gainedoutside of educational institutions some education develops little orno human capital when it produces few if any marketable skills andsome education even produces negative human capital in the form ofattitudes expectations and aversions that negatively impact theeconomy Depending on its content education may sometimes createideological aversions to working in the private sector or a refusal to doanything that does not seem to qualify as meaningful work thatis work spontaneously agreeable and fulfilling in itselfThe industrial revolution was not created primarily by people withmuch formal education It was in fact largely the work of people withpractical job skills and experience rather than a mastery of science ora systematic study of engineering The industrial revolution wasalready well underway before formal study of science and engineeringbecame widespread Even in later times such industrial pioneers asThomas Edison and Henry Ford had very little formal education theWright brothers were high school dropouts and in the electronic ageBill Gates and Michael Dell were dropouts from college In shorthuman capital is not synonymous with formal schoolingJust as human capital takes other forms besides education so therecan be widespread education without equally widespread humancapital Russia in the twentyfirst century has been called a societycharacterized by high levels of education but low levels of humancapital125 Among the more directly economic aspects of this is thatwhile Russia has about 6 percent of the worlds collegeeducatedpopulation it has less than onefifth of one percent of the worlds newCultural Factors 83patents and patent applications During the years from 1995 to 2008Germany produced about 60 times as many patents as Russia Japannearly 200 times as many patents and the United States about 500times as many patents Even the small citystate of Singaporeproduced more patents than Russia126None of this says that education is unimportant But both itsimportance as one form of human capital and its distribution requirespecific scrutiny rather than general celebration Here as elsewherefew things are equal among individuals groups or nations Evenamong collegeeducated people in different societies and culturesdisparities are both common and large Education As A Cultural ValueThe effects of differences between the way different cultures valueeducation do not end with the effect of differences in literacy rates eventhough literacy is a fundamental factor in the fate of individuals groupsand nations Different cultures differ not only in the amount ofeducation people seek but also in what kinds of education they seek andin the qualitative levels they achieve in that education Comparisons ofpeople from different social groups with the same education measuredin years of schooling miss the other dimensions of education and cantherefore often falsely ascribe discrimination when the rewards differamong individuals from different social racial or other groups withostensibly the same education as measured by years in schoolIt is not uncommon for some culturally distinct minority to havenot only more education but also qualitatively better education thanthe surrounding majority population either in terms of education inintellectually more challenging specialties or in terms of higherindividual achievements in their education In 1972 most of the As onuniversity entrance examinations in Sri Lanka went to members ofthe Tamil minority rather than members of the Sinhalese majority127During the days of the Ottoman Empire Armenian students84 Wealth Poverty and Politicsoutperformed students from the Turkish majority and even wrotebetter in the Ottoman Turkish language than Turkish students did128Choices of educational specialties can also differ greatly amonggroups with different cultures in the same society In Malaysia duringthe 1960s when university admissions were still based on academicqualifications there were more university students from the Chineseminority than from the Malay majority The disparity was especiallygreat in mathematical scientific and technological specialties Duringthe 1960s Chinese students received 1488 Bachelor of Sciencedegrees in Malaysia while Malay students received just 69 Inengineering Chinese students received 408 Bachelors degrees duringthe decade of the 1960s while Malay students received just four129In Germany in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuriesJewish students were similarly statistically overrepresented inGerman universities130 as they were in other times and placeswhether in Eastern Europe Argentina or Australia131 Today in NewYork Citys three elite and highly selective academic public highschools Stuyvesant Bronx Science and Brooklyn Tech Asianstudents outnumber white students by more than two to one This isin a city where Asians are only 14 percent of the public schoolstudents132By contrast majority groups that are lagging economically tendalso to lag educationally both quantitatively and qualitatively Asuniversity students they tend to specialize in easier subjects ratherthan in subjects like mathematics science or engineering This in turnoften leads to less promising careers or to unemployment Whatone study referred to as the welleducated but underemployedCzech young men in the nineteenth century133 had manycounterparts in other countries in the twentieth century when theeducated unemployed became a common expression whether inEurope Asia or elsewhere134People who have acquired academic degrees without acquiringmany economically meaningful skills not only face personaldisappointment and disaffection with society but also have oftenCultural Factors 85become negative factors in the economy and even sources of dangerespecially when they lash out at economically successful minoritiesand ethnically polarize the whole society they live inIn various Eastern European countries between the two WorldWars such newly educated young members of lagging majoritiesprovided much of the membership of antiSemitic movements135which became politically powerful leading to discrimination and evenviolence against Jewish students in the universities Not only werefrustrated young graduates from majority populations many thefirst generation of their families to reach higher education amongthe disaffected who blamed better prepared minorities for their ownlags the intelligentsia of lagging groups have likewise promotedgroup identity ideology and group identity politics This pattern extended far beyond Eastern Europe In many placesand times softsubject students and intellectuals have inflamedhostility and sometimes violence against many other successfulgroups whether in India136 Hungary137 Nigeria138 Kazakhstan139Romania140 Sri Lanka141 Canada142 or Czechoslovakia143 Incontemporary America many colleges and universities have wholedepartments devoted to promoting a sense of racial and ethnicgrievances against others while celebrating the isolation of groupidentities epitomized by ethnically separate residences on campusand sometimes even ethnically separate graduation ceremonies144As in other places and times whether in Europe Asia or elsewherethe intelligentsia of lagging groups have celebrated andor fabricatedpast glories of these groups in the interest of trying to retain individualswho might otherwise be tempted to rise into the larger society Whenthe author of the celebrated American book and television miniseriesRoots was challenged on its accuracy by historians his response was Iwas just trying to give my people a myth to live by145This approach was by no means unique to blacks or to the UnitedStates An international study of ethnic groups found culturalrevivals to be a response reflecting an awareness of the danger of afading group identity146 Daniel Patrick Moynihan said of his fellow86 Wealth Poverty and PoliticsIrish Americans The cruel part of this history is that by 1916 Irishnationalism in America had little to do with Ireland It was ahodgepodge of fine feeling and bad history with which theimmigrants filled a cultural void147 Preoccupation with past glorieseven when they are genuine can be an impediment to receptivity tocurrent advances available from other cultures as we have seen in thecase of China and the Middle EastThe pursuit of accurate knowledge and the pursuit of ideologicalsatisfaction have been conflicting goals whether in Americanuniversities today or in universities in other times and places Ahistory of East Central Europe between the two World Warscharacterized Romanian universities in that era as numericallyswollen academically rather lax and politically overheated servingas veritable incubators of surplus bureaucrats politicians anddemagogues148 Decades later universities in Sri Lanka likewise hada backlog of unemployed graduates who had specialized in thehumanities and the social sciences149Despite beliefs in some quarters that education makes people moretolerant of other cultures and groups it has been precisely such newlyeducated groups often lacking marketable skills who have promotedgroup polarization whether in Europe Asia or Africa As a notedAfrican scholar observed the educated Nigerian is the worst peddlerof tribalism150It was much the same story with the nineteenth century Czechintelligentsia including university students and school teachers whopromoted Czech cultural nationalism151 Among their demands werethat street signs in Prague which were in both Czech and Germanbe exclusively in Czech152 In the town of Budweis Czech culturalnationalists demanded that there be a quota of Czech music to beplayed by the town orchestra153There has been a similar insistent pettiness about language insimilar circumstances in twentieth century Quebec where lawsrequired that not only street signs be solely in French but alsoimposed legal restrictions on the use of English inside privateCultural Factors 87businesses154 Quebec authorities even tried to force pilots tocommunicate in French with air traffic controllers when landing ortaking off Only a threatened international pilot boycott of Quebecforced the local authorities to back down on this dangerous demandthat lives be risked by communication in an unfamiliar language155Even aside from ethnic issues more years of schooling cannotautomatically be equated with increased human capital Everythingdepends on whether more years in schools colleges and universitiesactually create economically meaningful skills or whether academiccredentials create a sense of entitlement beyond what the holders ofthose credentials actually produceThis is not to say that economic benefits are the only benefits ofeducation But it is to say that expectations or claims of entitlementto higher incomes or wealth have no basis unless the specific kinds ofeducation and the specific qualitative level of that education actuallycreate sufficient additional output to cover the additional income orwealth expectedWhen individuals from lagging groups whether racial regionalor other social groups tend to take less challenging coursesespecially when these individuals are the first generation of theirrespective families to reach the college or university level suchindividuals are unlikely to create as valuable services as people whostudy such obviously useful things as medicine science or technologyIn many poorer countries especially the educated unemployed areoften numerous enough to be not only a major disappointment but asocial and political dangerEven many of those with academic credentials but no economicallymeaningful skills who are in fact employed are often employed ingovernment bureaucracies since they are unlikely to be much indemand in competitive markets where employers are spending theirown money rather than spending the taxpayers money Sometimes jobsin government bureaucracies may be created in order to absorb largenumbers of young people who could otherwise be frustrated and88 Wealth Poverty and Politicsembittered enough to be politically troublesome for governmentofficials or even dangers to the society at large In poor countries especially swollen bureaucracies and the red tapethey generate are often an impediment to economic activity by peoplewho do have the human capital to advance the economy and createmuch needed rises in living standards for the society at large Attitudes Toward Work and ProgressAttitudes toward work differ greatly among groups in the samesociety as well as between one society and another and obviouslysuch differences can affect the production of wealth Many contemporaries of American antebellum Southern whitescommented on the lack of a work ethic among them156 These includednot only visitors from the North or from other countries but even suchstaunch Southerners as General Robert E Lee157 Many of thewhites according to a leading Southern historian were disposed to letgood enough alone and put off changes till the morrow158When German immigrants pioneering in America cut down treeswhile clearing land for farming they laboriously dug the stump andthe roots out of the ground so that all the land could be plowedSoutherners usually either cut down the tree or even simply girdled itand left it to die and rot but in any case left the stump in the groundand plowed around it159There were similar contrasts in the production of dairy productsIn 1860 the South had 40 percent of the dairy cows in the UnitedStates but produced just 20 percent of the butter and only one percentof the cheese160 The greater success of the largely German dairyfarmers of Wisconsin compared to the poor showing of dairyproduction in the South was explained by a scholar who wrote Theclose attention to duty the habits of steady skillful routine acceptedby butter fat producers of Wisconsin as a matter of fact are traits notyet present in southern culture161 This was said in 1932 The workCultural Factors 89attitudes and practices of the South persisted into at least the first halfof the twentieth centurySuch differences in work habits have been common in othercountries as well such as among laborers tapping rubber trees incolonial Malaya during the 1940sMany rubber estates kept records of the daily output of each tapper anddistinguished between the output of Chinese and Indian workers Theoutput of the Chinese was usually more than double that of the Indianswith all of them using the same simple equipment of tapping knife latexcup and latex bucket There were similar or even wider differencesbetween Chinese Indian and Malay smallholders  162Some groups avoid work not necessarily out of laziness but as amatter of principle In times past some European nobility oroffspring of affluent classes considered work beneath them But theBritish during the reign of the Tudors were not among those with thisattitudeThe younger son of the Tudor gentleman was not permitted to hangidle about the manorhouse a drain on the family income like theimpoverished nobles of the Continent who were too proud to work Hewas away making money in trade or in law163Economic outcomes are affected not only by attitudes toward workbut attitudes toward progress as well In modern industrial societiesprogress is more or less taken for granted but this was not always soeven in countries that are today modern societies As a distinguishedhistory of the rise of Western civilization said of Europe in medievaltimes the very idea of innovation was lacking men did what customprescribed cooperated in the plowing and to some extent in theharvesting and for many generations did not dream of trying tochange164Here as in other things Britain was an exception Wealthylandowners in Britain were not content to be passive recipients ofrents but actively promoted improvements in farming By the lateeighteenth century England was one of the leaders in agricultural90 Wealth Poverty and PoliticsCultural Factors 91advances making farming in Britain very different from farming inthe feudal serfdom of Eastern Europe or in the small peasant farmingin continental Western Europe165 Affluent and educated classes inBritain were also active in commerce and industry as well as inagriculture letters law and politics166By contrast newly educated young people in newly independentcountries in subSaharan Africa in the twentieth century oftendisdained the study of agriculture even in countries where agriculturewas a major part of the nations economy In Nigeria more than 40percent of the jobs for senior agricultural researchers were vacant atone time167 In Senegal it was 1979 nearly three decades afterindependence before agriculture was even taught at the universitylevel though the countrys University of Dakar had thousands ofliberal arts students168In parts of the Third World many people who have gotten aneducation feel that certain kinds of work are now simply beneaththem This includes working with their hands even as an engineerwhere they recoil from the prospect of physical contact withmachines169 preferring a desk job instead The prevalence of such attitudes is another cultural handicap forany group or nation especially those currently lagging economicallySometimes the problem is not just an aversion to work or to certainkinds of work but also a lack of drive for progress Here againAmericas antebellum South was an exampleTechniques of Southern agriculture changed slowly or not at all Soelementary a machine as the plow was adopted only gradually and only inscattered places as late as 1856 many small farmers in South Carolinawere still using the crude colonial hoe There was little change in thecotton gin gin house or baling screw between 1820 and the Civil War170The cotton gin a crucial factor in the economy of the antebellumSouth was invented by a Northerner When it came to inventions ingeneral only 8 percent of the US patents issued in 1851 went toresidents of the Southern states whose white population wasapproximately onethird of the white population of the country Evenin agriculture the main economic activity of the region only 9 out of62 patents for agricultural implements went to Southerners171Differences in habits and attitudes are differences in humancapital just as much as differences in knowledge and skills and suchdifferences create differences in economic outcomes As of the CivilWar era the North produced 14 times as much textiles as the Southdespite the Souths virtual monopoly of growing cotton The Northalso produced 15 times as much iron as the South 25 times themerchant ship tonnage and 32 times as many firearms172Even where the South had natural resource advantages such asiron ore and coal deposits located much closer together inBirmingham than in such other iron and steel producing centers asPittsburgh or Gary Indiana173 Southern deficiencies in humancapital among both labor and management handicapped thedevelopment of the steel industry in Birmingham174 It was much thesame story of rich natural resources and poor human capital in theSouthern lumber industry175 Similarly when the Southern textileindustry began with the advantage of being located in one of theworlds leading cottongrowing areas much of the goods turned outin the South had to be sent to New England for dyeing bleachingand finishing176Fortunately the South changed over the years especially in thesecond half of the twentieth century partly as a result of a greaterinflux of people from other parts of the country However suchcultural changes are not easy to create in all societies or among allgroups in a given society For outsiders to attempt to change a culture may be resented aswell as resisted As distinguished economic historian David S Landesput it criticisms of culture cut close to the ego and injure identityand selfesteem177 Outsiders can seldom change a culture withouta receptivity to cultural changes within the lagging group itself92 Wealth Poverty and PoliticsChapter 4SOCIAL  FACTORSMany social factors can affect economic differences betweennations and within nations These include the size anddemographic makeup of their populations and the human capital andsocial mobility in their societies Like geographic and cultural factorsnone of these things is the same between nations or within nationsPOPULATIONOne of the reasons sometimes offered for income and wealthdisparities among nations is that some nations are said to beoverpopulated and therefore living in poverty There are otheraspects of populations besides numbers that can also affect economicoutcomes for individuals groups or nations These include age andmobility both geographic mobility and social mobilityPopulation SizeOver the centuries a recurrent fear has been that the number ofpeople would grow to exceed the number for which there wasadequate food In times past this concern has been felt from theindividual family to local or national communities and many haveworried that the population of the world would grow to a sizeexceeding the worlds capacity to provide enough food to sustain thepeople in it93In times and places where there were families so poor that theywere living on the edge of subsistence it was not uncommon to killnewborn babies This was especially so when the baby was a girlbecause she might not grow strong enough soon enough to produceenough food for her own survival in a family where there was notenough food to keep feeding her without jeopardizing the survival ofthe family itself Among the benefits of economic progress wasreaching a level of productivity where such desperate and anguisheddecisions no longer had to be madeAnother benefit of economic progress has been achieving a level ofproductivity where the growing or gathering of food does not absorbso much of the time and efforts of so many people as to leave too littleof both to devote to developing the human capital on which theadvancement of civilization depends A more favorable geographic environment might allow the peoplein it to have not only a higher material standard of living but also amore developed culture However there is nothing inevitable aboutsuch an outcome A less stressful geographic setting can also lead to aless focused and less disciplined society able to indulge in moreconvivial and festive activities when nature provides food morereadily Geographic opportunities and geographic influences are notgeographic determinism Concerns over whether the world will produce enough food tosustain the people in it go back even before Thomas R Malthusfamous Essay on Population in 1798 But what Malthus did was to spellout a theory in a stark and dramatic form that made the issue indelibleand historic The Malthusian theory was based on two propositionsThe first proposition according to Malthus was that Populationwhen unchecked increases in a geometrical ratio while subsistenceincreases only in an arithmetical ratio The second proposition wasBy that law of our nature which makes food necessary to the life ofman the effects of these two unequal powers must be kept equal1In other words if human beings did not restrain their ownreproduction then famine disease and other disasters would bring94 Wealth Poverty and Politicspopulation back down to what the food supply could sustain Suchconcerns about the sustainability of population have waxed and wanedover the centuries since Malthus wrote But they have never completelydied out In 2014 a New York Times writer referred to Malthuspopulation theory as being based on an eminently sensible premisethat the earths carrying capacity has a limit2 But to say that there is alimit on anything is not to say that we are nearing that limit To go from saying that there is a limit to implying that we arenearing that limit is a classic nonsequitur far from being eminentlysensible Innumerable claims that we were running out of oil coaliron ore or some other natural resource have proved false time andagain going back at least as far as the nineteenth century But theworlds known reserves of petroleum at the end of the twentiethcentury were more than ten times what they were in the middle ofthat century3 when there were dire warnings that we were runningout The worlds known reserves of iron ore also increased severalfoldeven while the production of steel was rising dramatically It wasmuch the same story with the known reserves of other naturalresources For economic reasons it seldom pays to find more than aminute fraction of a natural resource at a given time even if there isenough in the ground to last for centuries4However plausible the Malthusian theory might seem it hasconsistently failed the test of empirical evidence even in Malthuslifetime5 There is no consistent correlation between population sizeor density and real income per capita Povertystricken subSaharanAfrica has a population density that is only a fraction of that inprosperous Japan6 It is possible to find some povertystrickencountries with greater population densities than some prosperouscountries But there is no consistent relationship between populationdensity and either wealth or poverty Looking at what happens overtime likewise gives no support to the theory that overpopulationcauses poverty As one of the leading economic developmenteconomists of the twentieth century pointed outSocial Factors 9596 Wealth Poverty and PoliticsBetween the 1890s and 1930s the sparsely populated area of Malaysiawith hamlets and fishing villages was transformed into a country withlarge cities extensive agricultural and mining operations and extensivecommerce The population rose from about one and a half to about sixmillion the number of Malays increased from about one to about twoand a half million The much larger population had much highermaterial standards and lived longer than the small population of the1890s Since the 1950s rapid population increase in denselypopulatedHong Kong and Singapore has been accompanied by large increases inreal income and wages The population of the Western world has morethan quadrupled since the middle of the eighteenth century Real incomeper head is estimated to have increased by a factor of five or more7Although advocates of the overpopulation theory argue thatrising population threatens to create more poverty virtually no oneseems able to provide examples of countries that had a higherstandard of living when their population was half of what it is todayFamines at various times and places have been taken by some asconfirmation of Malthus theory But famines ceased in denselypopulated regions like Western Europe and Japan while theycontinued in thinly populated regions like subSaharan AfricaFamines have been local phenomena often caused by local cropfailures or by military conflicts or other disasters that interfered withthe distribution of food Even when there is ample food available inthe world at large not all local transportation systems have beencapable of moving vast amounts of food into a faminestricken areaquickly enough to avert mass starvation and the diseases to whichpeople weakened by hunger are more vulnerable With the development and spread of modern transportationsystems famines have declined However particular places atparticular times can become susceptible to famine when these placesare politically isolated for political reasons Two of the mostdevastating famines of the twentieth century occurred in the SovietUnion in the 1930s under Stalin when millions of people died anddecades later in China under Mao when tens of millions diedNeither of these totalitarian dictators was going to admit to theoutside world that there was a famine in his country much less call onother countries for food since that would undermine the ideologythey were promoting internationally and perhaps undermine theirown regimes Nor were the people living under these repressiveregimes allowed free communication with the outside world But thelongrun capacity to produce enough food to support the people wasnot the issue In the Soviet Union the famine was concentrated in theUkraine which had been one of the great foodproducing regionsbefore the famine and would be again after the famine8 In neitherthe Soviet Union nor in China had population exceeded the capacityof the land to feed the people and in both places today an even largerpopulation is being fed In twentyfirst century China an estimatedonefourth of the population is overweight9Demographic CompositionThe mixture of ages within a given population varies greatly fromone society to another as well as among ethnic or other groups withina given society The median age in Japan Germany and Italy is overforty while the median age in Guatemala Nigeria and Afghanistan isunder twenty10 Within the United States Americans of Japaneseancestry are more than two decades older than Puerto Ricans11 If wemeasure adult work experience from age eighteen on this means thata fortyyearold worker has more than ten times as much experienceas a twentyyearold worker How can such a disparity inopportunities to acquire knowledge skills and maturity not create adisparity in economic outcomes among nations and within nations In countries where diseases poverty and other factors produceshorter life spans a smaller share of the population reaches the ageswhere levels of individual productivity are highest and among thosethat do they remain at those levels for less time before dyingWithin a given nation incomes vary greatly with age and wealtheven more so Moreover these disparities among age cohorts haveincreased over time as the value of the physical strength and energyof youth counts for less when mechanical sources of power haverendered human strength less important and more complexSocial Factors 97technology has made knowledge and analytical skills more valuableThe net result is that the age at which people receive their highestincomes has shifted upward in the United States Back in 1951 most Americans reached their peak earningsbetween 35 and 44 years of age and people in that age bracket earned60 percent more than workers in their early twenties By 1973 peoplein the same 35to 44yearold bracket earned more than double theincome of the younger workers Twenty years later the peak earningsbracket had moved up to people aged 45 to 54 years and people inthat bracket earned more than three times what workers in their earlytwenties earned12None of this should be surprising because people accumulatehuman capital as they grow older whether in the form of specificknowledge and skills or just maturity in dealing with other people andwith the responsibilities of their work What we choose to call laboris no longer simply physical exertions in the production processMany if not most workers are supplying not only labor but humancapital and the growing pay differential between experienced workersand entrylevel workers suggests that human capital is increasingly indemand in an economy that is growing both technologically andorganizationally more complexThe way children are raised also differs greatly andconsequentially from group to group and from one income level toanother A study found that American children in families where theparents are in professional occupations hear 2100 words an hour onaverage Children whose parents are working class hear an average of1200 words an hour and children whose family is on welfare hear 600words an hour13 What this means is that over the years a tenyearoldchild from a family on welfare will have heard not quite as many wordsat home as a threeyearold child whose parents are professionalsIt is painful to contemplate what that means cumulatively over theyears as poor children are handicapped from their earliest childhoodIt is not just in the quantity of words they hear that they arehandicapped They are also handicapped in both the quantity and the98 Wealth Poverty and Politicsquality of their parents Only 9 percent of American women withcollege degrees who gave birth in 2013 were unmarried But 61percent of women who were high school dropouts and gave birth thatyear were unmarried14It is hard to escape the conclusion reached by The Economistmagazine Nothing the government can do will give the children ofCabin Creek the same life chances as the children of Bethesda15Equal opportunity in the sense of being judged and rewarded by thesame standards as others cannot possibly mean equal life chances forchildren born and raised in these very different settings Another way of saying the same thing is that the fact that life isunfair is not the same as saying that a particular institution or aparticular society is unfair We cannot tell where the unfairness occurred bywhere the statistics were collected If the mix of children raised in welfarefamilies is racially different from the mix of children raised in familieswith parents who are professionals then statistics collected at a givenemployers business after these children have grown to adulthood maywell show a racial disparity between which employees are in higheroccupations and which are in lower occupations even if the employerhas treated every individual the same when hiring or promoting Evenif these employees were all born into the world with identical braincells the prospects of one set of them were enhanced while they weregrowing up and the prospects of the other set were blighted yearsearlier before either set of people reached the employerGeographic MobilityOne of the ways individuals and groups seek to raise theireconomic level is by moving from places where prospects seem poorto places where prospects seem more promising These moves can beSocial Factors 99  The same implicit assumption that the cause of disparities is located where thestatistics were collected underlies much fervent denunciation of the fact that thepoor pay more in lowincome neighborhood stores and in interest charges forpayday loans This issue is analyzed in my Basic Economics 5th edition pp 6669281283for relatively short distances as among shepherds leading their flocksfrom fields where these flocks have eaten most of the vegetation tofields where there is much vegetation still available Or the moves canbe from one country to another or from one continent to another aspeople from various parts of Europe immigrated to America andAustralia or people from India immigrated to Fiji Malaysia andAfrica Like other factors affecting the economic level and progress ofpeoples migrations have not been even or random factors but factorsreflecting many inequalities and creating moreImmigration has not been random either in the particular places inthe home country from which the immigrants leave or in the particularplaces where they settle in the country to which they relocate A studyof the immigration of southern Europeans to Australia before WorldWar II showed that they came not as a broad scatter from southernEurope as a whole but in concentrated streams from relatively smalland restricted areas and the great majority of immigrants settledfairly close together16 Nearly ninetenths of the Italian immigrants toAustralia who came from the Mount Etna region of Sicily settled inthe northern part of the state of Queensland while Italian immigrantsfrom the nearby Lipari Islands settled hundreds of miles to the southin Sydney and Melbourne17In the United States such patterns went right down to theneighborhood level During the era of mass immigration fromEurope to America Italian immigrants from different places in Italylived clustered together on particular streets within Italianneighborhoods in New York San Francisco and other Americancities18 Similar clusters of Italians from particular places in Italy werealso common in Buenos Aires and Toronto during that same era19Such patterns have been common among other immigrants goingto and from other countries around the world As noted in Chapter 3when immigration from Lebanon to Sierra Leone began after theFirst World War most of the immigrants came from particularvillages and settled in particular parts of Sierra Leone among peoplefrom the same villages and with the same religion Lebanese100 Wealth Poverty and Politicsimmigrants to Colombia likewise came from particular places in theMiddle East and settled in clusters together in particular places inColombia20 In the twentyfirst century immigrants from a particularprovince in China Fujian have settled together in a particularBrooklyn neighborhood21These are longstanding patterns in countries around the worldFrankfort Kentucky was founded by immigrants from Frankfurt inGermany22 and Grand Island Nebraska was first settled bySchleswigHolsteiners23 German farmers who had immigrated toRussia during the eighteenth century and then emigrated from thereto the United States in the nineteenth century did not settle inexisting German American enclaves much less among the Americanpopulation at large These German immigrants from Russia settled intheir own separate communities of Volga Germans and Black SeaGermans separate from each other as well as from other Germansand from Americans in general24Such nonrandom clusters of immigrants from many countriesliving in many other countries have been the rule rather than theexception Moreover even after the era of mass immigration fromEurope was over if one wished to have Americans of NorthernEuropean ancestry and Americans of Southern European ancestryliving randomly distributed among one another in the New Yorkmetropolitan area in the second half of the twentieth century onewould have had to move just over half of all Americans of SouthernEuropean ancestry in the New York area25The fact that the difference between black and whiteneighborhoods is visible to the naked eye in a way that these otherdifferences are not does not make the blackwhite difference uniqueMoreover within black communities different kinds of people havelong clustered in different places A study of the black community inChicago during the 1930s showed delinquency rates of more than 40percent in some black neighborhoods and delinquency rates under 2percent in other black neighborhoods26 Residential separationSocial Factors 101between different kinds of people within black communities was alsofound in Harlem and in other black communities as well27In general people sort themselves out in all kinds of groups withinraces as well as between races and in all sorts of countries around theworld There are reasons for such nonrandom residential patternswithin groups as well as between groups Like other patterns in manyother kinds of human activities they are not random because peopleare not behaving randomly but purposefully and their purposescircumstances and values differ This is too often forgotten by peoplewho react to nonrandom outcomes as strange if not sinister in manycontextsSocial MobilitySocial mobility is often discussed as a matter of individual goodfortune such as that in nineteenth century Horatio Alger novels aboutplucky lads who overcame adversity and eventually rose to reap theirjust reward But social mobility is far more important to the economicfate of nations Put differently a nation which creates obstacles to theuse of the talents potentialities and achievements of some of its ownpeople whether defined by race religion sex caste or whatever isneedlessly depriving itself of a source of greater prosperity Yet that isprecisely what has been done in innumerable times and places forthousands of years in countries around the worldCountries with fewer or less rigid barriers have often benefittedfrom the arrival of productive individuals and groups who were stifledor persecuted in the countries from which they fled Huguenots whofled religious persecution in seventeenth century France created thewatchmaking industry in London and made Switzerland the premierwatchmaking nation in the world28 Jewish scientists fleeing threatsto their personal survival in 1930s Europe played key roles in makingthe United States the first nuclear superpower29 Immigrants andtheir children also played major roles in creating modern industries insuch Latin American countries as Argentina Brazil and Chile30102 Wealth Poverty and PoliticsInternally Americans who rose from obscurity or sometimes evenpoverty to create or revolutionize whole industries would includeThomas Edison Henry Ford the Wright Brothers AndrewCarnegie David Sarnoff and many others whose impacts spreadacross the country and in some cases around the world Thereforemuch concern was aroused in the early twentyfirst century whenclaims were made that social mobility had declined greatly in theUnited States This concern was often expressed in terms of a setbackfor social justice but a decline in social mobility would also haveimplications for the economic fate of the country as a wholeLike so many words and phrases with great emotional and politicalimpact neither social mobility nor social justice has beenunambiguously defined A dictionary defines mobile as anythingthat can be moved Clearly by this definition a car with a 500horsepower engine is mobile even if it is parked at a given time oreven most of the time Another car with an engine only half aspowerful would not be said to be more mobile even if the second carwas used as a taxi and was therefore in motion a greater percentage ofthe time Mobility exists ex ante while movement exists ex postSimilarly as regards social mobility if we take mobility to mean thefreedom or option to move then we have a different definition fromthose who measure mobility by how many people have actuallymoved These differences in definitions involve far more thansemantic preferences They change the substance of what is being saidor insinuatedTo deliberately take an extreme example even a society with nobarriers whatever to upward mobility in its economy may neverthelesshave particular groups who do not actually move upward at allConversely a society with many barriers to upward mobility maynevertheless have particular groups who move upward anywayovercoming or circumventing those barriers In short we cannot determine how much mobility that isopportunity to move upward a given society has by how muchupward movement actually takes place That depends also to a greaterSocial Factors 103or lesser degree on the behavior of individuals and groups rather thanbeing solely a question of how much opportunity a given societyoffers It is an empirical question as to what the facts are in anyparticular case and we cannot allow that question to vanish into thinair by verbal sleight of hand in the definition of words Personalchoices and personal responsibility for the consequences of thosechoices matter Everything is not solely determined by societydespite how many may prefer to believe that it isIf nativeborn Americans in lower income brackets do not moveup nearly as often as immigrants who arrived in those same lowerincome brackets the Chinese and the Cubans for example thenthe question must be raised whether there are external barriers tomobility blocking the rise of nativeborn Americans and whichsomehow exempt immigrants Such a hypothesis hardly meets eventhe test of plausibility A more realistic explanation might be that lowincome immigrants bring a different set of attitudes and values thanthe attitudes and values of lowincome Americans In other words the real question is whether there are externalbarriers or internal cultures that account for the difference in actualmovement even when mobility as an opportunity still exists for bothThat question has wider implications If Americans at the bottom donot rise as often as in the past while immigrants can still risedramatically from one generation to the next then the reasons for thisretrogression among lowincome Americans need to be sought as willbe done in the next chapter on political factors In the meantime we need to consider those studies which simplymeasure social mobility by how much movement there is up anddown the economic scale It is these kinds of studies which have ledmany to conclude that social mobility as an opportunity has declinedin America Even within a framework that defines mobility by the amount ofmovement there are different questions that can be asked Forexample social mobility might be measured by 1 how much incomesand wealth rise within the lifetime of individuals 2 how much104 Wealth Poverty and Politicsincomes and wealth rise from one generation to the next or 3 howmuch the relative positions of the latest generation differ from therelative positions of their respective parents As regards the first question a number of studies show that theincome and wealth of individuals rise substantially over theirlifetimes31 For example only 13 percent of American householdsheaded by someone 25 years old have ever been in the top 20 percentin income while 73 percent of American households headed bysomeone 60 years old have32 This is hardly surprising since mostpeople begin their careers earning entrylevel salaries and then moveup over the years as they acquire more experience skills and maturity When social mobility is defined in terms of how the incomes ofone generation compare to the incomes of their parents that is afundamentally different question Fortunately two of the leadingstudies of social mobility in recent years Getting Ahead or LosingGround Economic Mobility in America 2008 and an update of thatstudy titled Pursuing the American Dream Economic Mobility AcrossGenerations 2012 were published by the Pew Charitable Trustswhich distinguishes various kinds of social mobility though somewho have quoted from these studies have not One of the things thesePew studies measure is whether a person has more or less incomeearnings or wealth than his or her parents did at the same age33The answer The vast majority of Americans have higher familyincomes than their parents did Moreover Fifty percent of Americanshave greater wealth than their parents did at the same age34A different question addressed by the Pew studies is how a personsrank on the income earnings or wealth ladder compared to his or herparents rank at the same age35 In other words do the children end upin a higher or lower relative position in income among theircontemporaries compared to their parents rankings among thecontemporaries of their day To this question the answer from this studyis Sixtysix percent of those raised in the bottom of the wealth ladderremain on the bottom two rungs themselves and 66 percent of thoseraised in the top of the wealth ladder remain on the top two rungs36Social Factors 105This is the crucial finding on which many commentators havebased their assertion that social mobility in America is now a mythHowever these Pew studies themselves caution that the data do notinclude immigrants37 because of a lack of historical data such as wereused for studying families that were in America for both parents andchildrens generations This is a crucial caveat because the original2008 Pew study itself said that its findings do not apply to immigrantfamilies for whom the American Dream is alive and well38If lowincome immigrants are able to move up even when nativeborn Americans tend to stay in their same relative economic positionsfrom one generation to the next that strongly suggests that Americansociety continues to offer opportunities to move up economically butthat not all groups make the same use of these opportunities MENTAL  CAPABILITIESThere is a vast complex and inconclusive literature on the mentalpotential of different racial groups But the practical question for anyoneinvestigating current economic disparities between individuals or groupsis not what their mental potential was at birth but what human capitalthey developed as they grew up and can bring with them as adults to ajob or a college or to the creation of a business or a scientific endeavorSuch developed capabilities have obviously varied enormously notonly among racial or ethnic groups but also among people living inmajor urban centers as compared to people living in isolated mountainvillages or other isolated or otherwise unpromising locations Nor is thisa new phenomenon of modern times As previously noted the Greekswere far more advanced than the British thousands of years ago In thedays of the Roman Empire Cicero warned his fellow Romans againstbuying British slaves since they were so hard to teach39 Given the vastcultural gulf between the illiterate tribal Britons of that era and thecomplex and sophisticated society of ancient Rome it is hard toimagine how things could have been otherwise With the advantage of106 Wealth Poverty and Politicscenturies of historical hindsight we can recognize today that thisdisparity in human capital was not permanent which is not to denythat it was present and consequential at the timeToday with the specter of genetic determinism hovering in thebackground many are loath to admit that there are major differencesin developed mental capabilities among racial or ethnic groups Teststhat show such differences are dismissed as culturally biased testsand historical evidence of such differences is dismissed asstereotypes Racial differences in patterns of employment andpromotion are treated as evidence of discrimination People whopresent empirical evidence of differences in current mentalcapabilities are often denounced as racists Such reactions are notconfined to racial or ethnic leaders or spokesmen or to politiciansresponsive to racial or ethnic voting blocs Many academic scholarshave had similar reactions and so have some Supreme Court justicesYet such attempts to evade or discredit empirical evidence are asunnecessary as they are futile for there is other empirical evidenceagainst genetic determinism For example there have been notmerely individual whites or white families but whole communities ofwhites from isolated mountain regions in America whose average IQshave been similar to or lower than the average IQs of blackAmericans40 Mental tests given to American soldiers during theFirst World War likewise showed that whites from some Southernstates scored lower than blacks from some Northern states41 Butwhile such evidence undermines genetic determinism that does notmake mental test differences irrelevant any more than the greatachievements of the British many centuries after the decline and fallof the Roman Empire deny that Britons in Roman times were notfunctioning at the same intellectual level as RomansPredictive ValidityMental tests to measure intellectual capabilities have been caughtin a crossfire of controversies However a distinction must be madeSocial Factors 107between the predictive validity of a mental test and whether itmeasures real intelligence however the latter might be definedClearly no current mental test can retroactively measure nativeintelligence that is mental potential years earlier at birth which iswhat the controversies over innate intelligence are ultimately allabout The predictive validity of a test however is a very different andstraightforward statistical question about the extent to which aparticular tests results correlate with later performances in schools ona job or in some other endeavor Obvious as this might seem the Supreme Court of the UnitedStates ruled in the landmark case of Griggs v Duke Power Co thatemployers must validate tests which have a disparate impact onminority groups when those tests are unrelated to measuring jobcapability42In other words the plausibility of the tests relevance to the job asjudged by third parties with neither expertise nor experience in thejobs themselves must be the criterion according to the SupremeCourt not the objectively demonstrated statistical correlationbetween the scores received on a test and the scorers subsequentperformances on the job But if scores on an IQ test correlate with thequality of pilots subsequent performances in the air this means thatthe test is predictively valid even if there is not a single question onthe IQ test that has anything to do with flying a plane Even if an IQtest does not measure real intelligence however defined ifwhatever it does measure is correlated with pilots subsequentperformance then it is predictively valid for that specific purposewhether or not it measures innate mental potentialEducational TestsEmployment tests are not the only tests under attack when theyresult in different racial or ethnic groups scoring at very differentlevels on these tests The use of such tests to determine who will andwill not be admitted to selective public high schools such as Lowell108 Wealth Poverty and PoliticsHigh School in San Francisco or New York Citys three highlyselective high schools Stuyvesant Bronx Science and BrooklynTech has also been under attack especially by spokesmen for racialor ethnic groups who do not gain admissions as often as others Evenlarger numbers of attacks have been directed at college admissionstests across the countryWith academic admissions tests as with tests for employment andpromotions intergroup disparities have often been extreme At onetime Jewish students were so overrepresented among those whosuccessfully passed admissions tests to Stuyvesant High School thatStuyvesant was referred to by critics as a free prep school for Jewsand a privileged little ivory tower43Today it is Asian American students who predominate not only atStuyvesant but at Bronx Science and Brooklyn Tech as well At allthree of these highly selective schools where admissions are based onacademic tests Asian American students are not only a majority of allstudents but outnumber white students by more than two to one44The issues raised by critics of academic admissions tests whetherat the high school or college level raise questions that go to the heartof what education is about and what its role is in the larger societyThe ultimate value of high performance schools and colleges is notdetermined by the benefits they confer on whatever individuals orgroups constitute the students who pass through these institutionsThe most important value of such institutions consists of the benefitsconferred on society at large from the work in later life of people withhighpowered intellectual skills whether in medicine science orother endeavors It is not a question of how many of these schools graduates wereadmitted to Harvard or by the fact that in some years more graduatesof Brooklyn Tech have been admitted to MIT than the graduates ofany other high school in the country45 The real value of highlyselective and intellectually elite high schools is in what their alumnigo on to achieve that benefits vastly more other people thanthemselves Social Factors 109The many prizes and awards accumulated over the years bystudents from Stuyvesant Bronx Science and Brooklyn Tech are justsymptoms of their contributions to society at large These includemany Westinghouse Science awards Intel Science awards PulitzerPrizes and multiple Nobel Prizes Seven graduates from BronxScience alone have gone on to receive Nobel Prizes in physics aloneand graduates from Stuyvesant and Brooklyn Tech have also gone onto receive Nobel Prizes That a particular student goes on to become a brain surgeon is ofcourse significant in that individuals life but it is of far greatersignificance to vastly more people whose lives are saved in the courseof the surgeons career Just one graduate of New Yorks selectiveTownsend Harris High School Jonas Salk made an incalculablecontribution to society and to the world by developing a vaccinethat put an end to the tragic scourge of polioThe envy and resentment of achievements that have been painfulfacts of life in other times and places around the world are perhaps notsurprising in an educational context But such envy and resentment arecertainly nothing to be encouraged to the ultimate detriment of societyat large whose progress is advanced disproportionately by theachievements of people with highly developed levels of human capital To refer to Stuyvesant High School as a privileged little ivorytower may be clever but cleverness is not wisdom Slippery use of theword privilege is part of a vogue of calling achievementsprivileges a vogue which extends far beyond educational issuesspreading a toxic confusion in many other aspects of life A privilegeexists ex ante and is fundamentally different from an achievementwhich exists ex post Students whose demonstrated academicachievements earn them admission to highpowered educationalinstitutions are fundamentally different from students admitted onthe basis of demographic diversity or political expediency Whether the elite public high schools of New York wereoverwhelmingly Jewish in one era or overwhelmingly Asian in a laterera their lack of demographic diversity seems not to have adversely110 Wealth Poverty and Politicsaffected their educational performances or their graduatesachievements in later life And that is what such schools are there fornot to present a tableau that matches fashionable preconceptionsPassionate advocacy of the interests of lagging minorities hasseldom been followed by equally dedicated empirical investigation asto whether those minorities have actually benefitted on net balancefrom the success of those advocacies The triumph of egalitarianprinciples and demographic diversity in the rest of New Yorkseducational system has not resulted in an increase in the number orproportion of black or Hispanic students passing the admissions teststo get into Stuyvesant Bronx Science and Brooklyn Tech On thecontrary the numbers and proportions of black and Hispanic studentshave declined substantially over the years at all three institutions46Back in 1938 the proportion of blacks attending Stuyvesant HighSchool was almost as high as the proportion of blacks in the cityspopulation47 But 1938 was the last year when this was true Thesharpest declines occurred in the second half of the twentieth centurywhen the socioeconomic position of blacks was far higher than in1938 As of 1979 blacks were 129 percent of the students atStuyvesant but in 1995 the New York Times reported that only 48percent of the students at Stuyvesant were black48 As of 2012 theNew York Times reported that blacks were now 12 percent of thestudents at Stuyvesant High School49In short over a period of 33 years the proportion of blacks gainingadmission to Stuyvesant High School fell to just under onetenth ofwhat it had been before None of the usual explanations of racialdisparities genetics racism poverty or a legacy of slavery canexplain this retrogression over time Back in 1938 both racism andpoverty were worse than in later times and the blacks of 1938 weregenerations closer to slavery Clearly something else was happeningSuch distressing and puzzling trends present a challenge tobelievers in either heredity or environment where environment isdefined in the usual socioeconomic terms There is no obvious oreven plausible genetic reason why blacks of an earlier generationSocial Factors 111should have been more able to meet demanding mental test standardsto get into an elite public high school An environmental explanationin socioeconomic terms has even worse problems sincesocioeconomic conditions have clearly improved among blacks since1938 both absolutely and relative to the general population One ofthe few possibilities left is that the culture within black communitieshas in some respect changed for the worse over the yearsThere have long been different cultures among blacks One hasbeen the culture of the old South the culture which created manyhandicaps for white Southerners50 of which the low mental testscores of white soldiers from Southern states during the first WorldWar51 were just one symptomThe thousands of volunteers from the North who went into theSouth after the Civil War to take on the formidable task of educatingthe children of freed slaves were led by people who operated on thepremise that a major objective of that education should be displacingthe Southern culture that blacks had absorbed This premise waspublicly proclaimed52 in contrast to the opposite premise in our timesthat preserving and praising the black culture is important in educationA disproportionate share of the Northern educators who wentSouth after the Civil War were from New England and sought toreplace the Southern culture among blacks with the contrasting cultureof New England Given the limited economic resources available thiswas possible only in a relatively few educational institutions but thosefew institutions produced a very disproportionate share of black leadersand pioneers in a number of fields53One of those institutions was the first black public high school inthe country founded in 1870 in Washington DC In 1899 whentests were given in the citys four academic high schools three whiteand one black this black high school scored higher than two of thethree white high schools54This was not an isolated fluke Although the IQ of blacks hasconsistently averaged around 85 over the years the average IQ at thisschool called by various names over the years including Dunbar112 Wealth Poverty and PoliticsHigh School after 1916 was consistently at or above 100 every yearfrom 1938 to 1955 except for 1945 when it was 9955 This was in theabsence of IQ tests and with many students with IQs below 100being admitted to Dunbar on the strength of their academicrecords56 Nor was there diversity This school had an allblackstudent body during the entire 85 years of its academic ascendancyfrom 1870 to 1955Most of its graduates went on to college during that era which wasunusual for either black or white high school graduates in those yearsSome graduates began going to elite colleges in the late nineteenthcentury and the schools first graduate who went to Harvard did so in1903 From 1892 to 1954 Amherst admitted 34 of these graduatesOf these 74 percent graduated from Amherst and 28 percent of thesegraduates were Phi Beta Kappas57 Nor was Amherst unique Overthe years the schools graduates went on to become Phi Beta Kappasat Harvard Yale Amherst Williams Cornell Dartmouth and otherelite institutions58In terms of their later careers the first black who pioneered in anumber of fields also came from this one school These included thefirst black man to graduate from Annapolis59 the first black enlistedman in the Army to rise to become a commissioned officer60 the firstblack woman to receive a PhD from an American university61 the firstblack federal judge the first black general the first black Cabinetmember and among other notables Dr Charles Drew who achievedinternational recognition for his pioneering work on the use of bloodplasma62 During World War II when black military officers were rarethere were among Dunbar High Schools graduates many captains andlieutenants nearly a score of majors nine colonels and lieutenantcolonels and one brigadier general63All of this from one public high school in a black community wasremarkable enough What is relevant to the issue of culture was thatthis was a school which from its beginning had a wholly differentcultural orientation from that of the ghetto culture Seven of its firstten principals were educated in a New England environment Four hadSocial Factors 113114 Wealth Poverty and Politicsdegrees from colleges located in New England and three had degreesfrom Oberlin College which was established by New Englanders inOhio as a deliberate project to plant New England culture in themidwest Dunbar High School issued a handbook on behavior to itsstudents that spelled out how one should act not only in the school butin the world at large64 The values and deportment these students weretaught would today be called by critics acting white Nor did the difference in the way Dunbar students behaved gounnoticed in the local black community Dunbar High Schoolbecame so controversial among blacks in Washington that the latePulitzer Prizewinning Washington Post columnist WilliamRaspberry said that you could turn any social gathering of the citysmiddleaged blacks into warring factions by simply saying the oneword Dunbar65 Resentments of Dunbar High School inWashingtons black community were as common as resentments ofNew Yorks elite public high schools and resentments of other highachievers in other countries around the world The clash between proud alumni of Dunbar and other blacksantagonistic to the school became so bitter that a controversy over whatto do with the original Dunbar High School building after a moremodern building was built to replace it became literally a federal casethat went up to the US Circuit Court of Appeals When the issue wasfirst raised in Washingtons City Council one member of that Councilsaid There are people in this city who say that the school represents asymbol of an litism among blacks that should never happen again I saywe should raze it66 After the Dunbar alumni lost in the courts theoriginal Dunbar High School building was demolished It was one ofmany triumphs of the ghetto culture across the country in the secondhalf of the twentieth century with consequences that spread far beyondeducational institutions The changing social climate of the 1960s and beyond included acelebration of the ghetto culture essentially an offshoot of thedysfunctional redneck culture of the South67 though often regardedSocial Factors 115  Socalled black English for example has no connection with languages in Africabut very strong connections with the way English was spoken centuries ago in theparts of Britain from which white Southerners came See for example DavidHackett Fischer Albions Seed Four British Folkways in America New York OxfordUniversity Press 1989 pp 256258as something uniquely black or even African despite much evidenceto the contrary So pervasive did the influence of this ghetto culturebecome that even middleclass black youngsters felt a need to adoptattitudes values and behavior from that ghetto culture as a sign ofracial solidarity or a need to avoid the stigma of acting white and thesocial consequences which could follow ranging from ridicule toostracism to threats and outright violence Legendary basketball star Kareem AbdulJabbar described what itwas like for him as a youngster growing up in this cultureI got all As and was hated for it I spoke correctly and was called a punk Ihad to learn a new language simply to be able to deal with the threats Ihad good manners and was a good little boy and paid for it with my hide68None of this was unique to a particular individual or a particularplace It was a growing influence among blacks across the country Astudy of black youngsters in the racially mixed affluent suburb of ShakerHeights Ohio found these youngsters far behind their white peersacademically Nor was the reason mysterious Black students spent farless time studying and far more time watching television or engaging inother activities69 Nor was this simple laziness There was an actualaversion to behaviors regarded as acting white According to theresearcher who studied these black students The White behavior mostoften singled out for criticism was talking proper70 In other wordsspeaking standard English was seen as a racial betrayalWhat amazed me the researcher said is that these kids whocome from homes of doctors and lawyers are not thinking like theirparents they dont know how their parents made it Instead they arelooking at rappers in ghettos as their role models they are looking atentertainers71 The normal incentives against shortsighted youngpeople throwing away their education and thus in many cases theirchance for a decent life are greatly reduced when schools promotethem to the next grade whether they have learned what they weresupposed to have learned or not When asked why they were nottaking their school work seriously many black students in ShakerHeights said that they knew they were going to be promoted to thenext grade anyway72 What lay ahead of them in life after theyfinished school was apparently beyond their time horizonSchool teachers and administrators were not the only adultsreducing the incentives for black youngsters to take school workseriously Many black leaders and spokesmen like leaders andspokesmen for other lagging racial or ethnic groups in various othercountries depict their groups problems as primarily or solely due toother people and depict opposing those other groups and their cultureas the way to advance Moreover many among the intelligentsia and ineducational institutions go along in the spirit of helping blacks One ofthe black leaders who rejected this approach was Martin Luther KingJr He said We cant keep on blaming the white man There are thingswe must do for ourselves73 But that has not been the prevailing viewIt is not just in elite schools that we can see educationalretrogression among black youngsters We have grown so used toseeing ghetto schools lag far behind other schools that it may besurprising for some to learn that this was not always the case As of1941 for example test scores in a sample of classes in Harlemelementary schools were very similar to test scores in a sample ofclasses in the same grades in white schools in working classneighborhoods on New Yorks Lower East Side In April of that year there were some questions on which sixthgrade classes in some Harlem schools did marginally better than sixthgrade classes in the white schools on the Lower East Side while onother questions these white sixth graders did marginally better thantheir counterparts in Harlem The same was true of third grade classesin the two neighborhoods in May 1947 December 1941 saw all sixthgrade classes in the sample of Harlem schools do marginally betterthan sixth grade classes in the sample of Lower East Side schools on116 Wealth Poverty and Politicsall the questions February 1951 saw a class in a junior high school onthe Lower East Side do marginally better than the average of an allmale and an allfemale junior high school in Harlem74In short there were no serious differences in test results in thesesamples of Harlem schools and Lower East Side schools These wereall just ordinary workingclass neighborhood schools with no realdifference in educational results between those schools that wereblack and those that were whiteThe educational retrogression to the situation today seems farmore explicable by cultural retrogressions in the intervening yearsthan by alternative theories of either heredity or environment whenenvironment is defined as surrounding socioeconomic conditions asdistinguished from including internal changes in cultural valuesOther social retrogressions over the same years include changes froman era when most black children were raised in twoparent homes toan era when the vast majority were not It should also be noted that despite the prevalence of poverty inmany black communities the poverty rate among black marriedcouples has been in single digits every year since 199475 In otherwords those blacks whose behavior put them outside the pattern ofthe spreading ghetto culture escaped poverty to a far greater extentthan other blacksCulture matters The ghetto culture was not new but it had notspread so much to other parts of the black community before thesecond half of the twentieth century when it became widelycelebrated especially by both the black and the white intelligentsiaColleges and UniversitiesAt the college level egalitarian and demographic diversitycriteria have triumphed in admissions policies and practices even atelite institutions so the question is how this has affected the outcomesfor black and Hispanic students in college and beyond Affirmativeaction policies can ensure that there are more minority students onSocial Factors 117campus but these policies cannot ensure that they will graduatemuch less graduate in challenging subjects like mathematics scienceand engineering Despite rising numbers of black students admitted to theUniversity of California at Berkeley during the 1980s the number ofblack students graduating actually declined76 Conversely when a banon affirmative action in admissions to the University of Californiasystem was imposed in the following decade the number of blackstudents declined slightly in the system as a whole but the number ofblack students graduating increased The number of Hispanicstudents who graduated also rose substantially77 now that minoritystudents were being admitted to those campuses of the University ofCalifornia system that matched their academic qualifications ratherthan being mismatched with Berkeley or UCLA for the sake ofdemographic representationIn the wake of the ban on affirmative action the number of blackand Hispanic students who graduated in four years rose 55 percentthose who graduated with degrees in science technology engineeringand mathematics rose by 51 percent and those who graduated withgrade point averages of 35 or higher rose by 63 percent These resultsconfirmed what many critics of affirmative action in academia hadlong said the students mismatched with institutions whose standardsthey did not meet would either fail to graduate as often as others orwould manage to graduate only by avoiding difficult subjects likescience technology engineering and mathematicsA widely acclaimed attempt to say that affirmative action wassuccessful The Shape of the River by former college presidentsWilliam Bowen and Derek Bok had crucial defects1 Although the study purported to show that blacksadmitted under affirmative action policies with loweracademic qualifications did well the actual samples inthe statistics lumped together all black studentsthose who were admitted with the same qualifications118 Wealth Poverty and PoliticsSocial Factors 119as other students and those admitted under affirmativeaction with lower qualifications than the otherstudents78 The absence of data on the groupspecifically at issue those particular black studentswho were admitted with lower qualifications makesthat study the statistical equivalent of Hamlet withoutthe prince of Denmark2 Despite Bowens and Boks apparently triumphantfinding that black students in their sample graduatedat higher rates the more selective the school that theyattended79 that is not the mismatch hypothesis beingtested The mismatch hypothesis says that the largerthe differential in academic qualifications betweenblack and white students at a given institution thelarger the racial differential in failure to graduate tendsto be  When this hypothesis is tested at specificindividual institutions as was done in theThernstroms America in Black and White rather thanin aggregations of institutions from different SATlevels as in The Shape of the River the mismatchhypothesis is confirmed  Both studies use combinedSAT scores as the measure of academic qualificationThe data in America in Black and White show that thedifference between the combined SAT scores of blackstudents and other students at Harvard for examplewas 95 points 1305 versus 1400 while thedifference at Rice University was 271 pointsCorrespondingly the racial difference in dropout rateswas 2 percentage points at Harvard and 15 percentagepoints at Rice80 In the BowenBok aggregations Riceis included in an aggregation that also includesPrinceton81 which has a much smaller racialdifferential in SAT scores than at Rice and acorrespondingly smaller racial differential in dropoutrates namely 4 percentage points while Harvard isomitted from this selection of schools with top SATscores Thus confirmations of the mismatchhypothesis within the same category of institutionsvanish from view when the focus is on comparisons ofdifferent aggregations Statistical wonders can beperformed with aggregations but these wonders donot necessarily stand up when individual institutionsare examined Data from other studies of individualinstitutions show results very similar to those inAmerica in Black and White and very different fromthose in The Shape of the River823 Other researchers were denied access to the raw datafrom which Bowen and Bok derived theirconclusions83The acclaim for the Bowen and Bok book may have had more todo with how welcome its conclusions were in many quarters ratherthan the quality of its evidence or logic What they said fit theprevailing vision which was apparently enough to exempt theirconclusions from the further requirement of fitting the factsInnate PotentialDeveloped mental capabilities are not only more readily measuredbut are more demonstrably important than innate mental potentialIndeed the significance of innate potential derives largely fromwhatever role it might have as a source of or limitation on developedmental capabilities Whether we are choosing a plumber or a surgeonwhat we most want to know is that individuals skill at plumbing orsurgery not whether that skill was due to heredity or environmentIn the heyday of genetic determinism in the early twentiethcentury it was widely assumed by genetic determinists that geneticpotential put a ceiling on the mental capabilities that could be120 Wealth Poverty and Politicsdeveloped in some racial or ethnic groups Because members of somegroups were deemed to be intellectually capable of being no morethan the proverbial hewers of wood and drawers of water geneticdeterminists supported eugenics a term coined by Francis Galtonwho advocated the gradual extinction of an inferior race84The eugenics movement spanned the Atlantic Perhaps even moreremarkably it spanned the ideological spectrum from conservativeslike Winston Churchill and Neville Chamberlain to people on the leftlike John Maynard Keynes and leading Fabian socialists in Englandwhile a similar sweep in the United States ranged from socialist JackLondon to conservative icon Henry L Mencken Many American writings by genetic determinists of that erasought to show that Eastern Europeans and Southern Europeanswere innately inferior intellectually to Northern Europeans85 Thiswas an era when mass immigration from Europe to America hadshifted from the Northern regions of Europe to its Eastern andSouthern regions provoking fears that intellectually inferior andculturally unassimilable immigrants were flooding into the UnitedStates Belief in the innate inferiority of blacks was already sowidespread and so deeply believed that literature on this subject wasnot comparably large Later empirical evidence undermined the conclusions drawn at thepeak of the ascendancy of genetic determinism As noted earlier Jewsbegan to score above the national average on mental tests forexample86 leading to mental test pioneer Carl Brighams recantationof his earlier views87 Others brought out the fact that white soldiersfrom several Southern states scored lower on the Armys mental teststhan black soldiers from several Northern states88 undermining themost widely accepted racial version of genetic determinism Not only did such results undermine the theory of a genetic basisfor blackwhite differences in performances on mental tests theseresults were also inconsistent with the presumed innate mentalsuperiority of Northern Europeans to Southern Europeans since theAmerican South was settled primarily by the supposedly superiorSocial Factors 121Northern European population from Britain while the massiveimmigration from Eastern Europe and Southern Europe settledprimarily outside the South A closer examination of the performances of black soldiers on mentaltests during the First World War raises questions about their culturallevel at that time just as cultural questions were raised when CarlBrigham reexamined his conclusions about white immigrants who hadbeen raised in homes where English was not the language spokenFor blacks who took the Army tests their very low level of literacyat that time was likewise a factor to be considered though fewcommentators took that into account One sign of the effect of thelow level of literacy among black soldiers taking the Army mentaltests and how that could affect the results was that a largerproportion of black soldiers were able to answer some of the moredifficult test questions that did not require understanding themeaning of written words than were able to answer much simplerquestions that didIn many parts of the Army Alpha test used during the First WorldWar the modal score of black soldiers was zero derived bysubtracting incorrect answers from correct answers in order toneutralize the effect of guessing These results were despite the factthat the actual intellectual substance of some of these questionsinvolved only knowing that yes and no were opposites as werenight and day bitter and sweet and other similarly extremelyeasy questions questions too simple to be missed by anyone whoknew what the word opposite meantIn the Army Beta test given to soldiers who could not read someof the questions involved looking at pictures of a pile of blocks and122 Wealth Poverty and Politics  The lower mental test scores of Southern whites are consistent with the fact thatmany if not most white Southerners emigrated from culturally isolated regions ofBritain before those regions were incorporated into the mainstream culture of thecountry and before the

South TuscaloosaUniversity of Alabama Press 1988 p 56determining how many blocks there were including blocks that werenot visible but whose presence had to be inferred and counted fromthe shape of the piles Yet fewer than half of the illiterate blacksoldiers who took the Armys Beta test received a score of zero onsuch questions which were more intellectually demanding but didnot require the ability to understand written words like opposite orwritten directions that may have been challenging to literate blacksoldiers whose literacy might have been very thin during that erawhen many blacks had very little education either quantitatively orqualitatively in inferior Southern schoolsGiven the very small quantity and low quality of educationreceived by that generation of blacks even those who were technicallyliterate were unlikely to have a substantial vocabulary of writtenwords So it is hardly surprising that the completely illiterate blacksoldiers did better on substantively more challenging questions thanblacks with some ability to read did on simpler questions89Decades later the research of Professor James R Flynn anAmerican expatriate in New Zealand brought out the fact that theraw scores on IQ tests had risen in a generation or two by a standarddeviation or more in more than a dozen countries90 calling intoquestion the belief that scores on these tests measured some fixedgenetic endowment The repeated renorming of IQ tests in order to maintain thedefinitional average IQ at 100 while the number of questionsanswered correctly changed had previously concealed this huge rise inthe raw scores on IQ tests These rises in raw scores included the rawscores of black Americans whose IQs had remained at about 85 overthe years as the tests were renormed But the average number ofquestions answered correctly on IQ tests by blacks in 2002 wouldhave given them an average IQ of 104 by the norms used in19471948 which is to say slightly higher than the averageperformance of Americans in general during the earlier period91Whether or to what extent existing gaps in IQ are due to heredityis by no means a settled issue But even with something that isSocial Factors 123generally agreed to be determined primarily by heredity such asheight that does not mean that all existing differences in height aredue to heredity much less that heights cannot vary for other reasonsbesides heredity in particular cases or change over timeThe average height of Britons for example was once greater thanthe average height of the French as far back as the early eighteenthcentury and continuing on into the twentieth century However after1967 the average height of the French equaled the average height ofBritons92 While the gap in height between the British and theFrench closed a gap between the heights of North Koreans andSouth Koreans opened up after the country was partitioned followingthe Second World War93 with people in North Korea living under adraconian dictatorship that kept them povertystricken and illfed InHolland the average height of young males increased from 5 feet 4inches to 6 feet between the middle of the nineteenth century and theearly twentyfirst century94Even in the absence of these various empirical findings thetheories of genetic determinism that prevailed in the early twentiethcentury suffered from the relatively narrow slice of the millennia ofhuman history from which they generalized The recurring theme indiscussions of American immigration laws during that era was thatimmigrants from Southern Europe were mentally inferior to thosefrom Northern Europe inferior not just in education or variousother contemporary accomplishments but innately genetically andpermanently inferior95In the past few centuries Northern Europe has in factoutperformed Southern Europe in many ways in its economies inscience and in technology for example But in ancient timesSouthern Europe outperformed Northern Europe by a far widermargin and there is no indication that the genes of people in eitherpart of Europe changed Meanwhile China over the centuries lost itsonce commanding lead over all the Europeans and over Japanwhich much later overtook China again without any indication thatgenes had changed in any of these races 124 Wealth Poverty and PoliticsLooked at another way strongly similar economic and socialpatterns have been found among people in certain geographicsettings such as mountain communities in various parts of theworld which is to say among people of different races with nogenetic connection to one another Believers in genetic determinismwill have to explain not only the coincidence of such nongeneticallybased similarities among these groups but also why persistentlylagging groups from Canary Islanders in the past to various subSaharan Africans to Australian aborigines have shared an unusuallysevere degree of isolation There have been not only individual whites but wholecommunities of whites who scored at the same average IQ level asAmerican blacks or lower The national average is itself an amalgamof very different IQs among groups as well as individuals so thatcomparison of any given group with the national average can suggesta uniqueness that is simply not there During the era of massimmigration to America from Europe immigrants from Spain ItalyGreece Portugal and Poland scored at or below the IQs of Americanblacks96 Other groups of whites with average IQs no higher thanthose of blacks have included white mountaineer communities in theUnited States canal boat people in Britain and the Gaelicspeakinginhabitants of the Hebrides Islands off Scotland97In short genes are neither necessary nor sufficient to explain mostof the social patterns of disparate achievements that geneticdeterminists tried to explain However important genetics may be ina medical or other scientific context the relative influence of heredityand environment on the intelligence of different races remains anunresolved issue Even if we were to accept IQ tests as a universally valid measure ofintelligence for the sake of argument the existing range of IQ scoresamong blacks goes far above the average IQ of whites even thoughwhites as a group have higher average IQs than blacks as a group Theeugenics agenda of the genetic determinists in the early twentiethcentury seemed to be based on an implicit assumption that there wasSocial Factors 125a ceiling on the intelligence of particular racial or ethnic groups notsimply that the average of their intelligence was lower at a particulartime or place Groups with identical ranges of innate intellectual potential canstill end up with different averages if environmental circumstancescause different rates of reproduction or survival in various segments oftheir respective populations In other words environments can changethe statistical average of IQs even if the range of IQs remainsunchanged It has been suggested for example that the failure toreconsider current welfare policies that may be promoting a higherrate of reproduction of lower classes within the black communitymay be our societys greatest injustice to the black population It waspointed out that threefourths of the blacks who failed mental testsgiven by the armed forces come from families of four or morechildren98Few American professional families of any race have four or morechildren which may be more common among unwed teenage motherswho are high school dropouts for whom the children are their mealticket in a world with very few better options for them by the timethey have frittered away their educational opportunities To have theproportion of the black population that is born to unwed teenagedropouts artificially increased by government policies is hardly abenefit to either the black population or to the society at largeThe backlash against genetic determinism in later years hasproduced social philosophies lacking even as much evidence as thegenetic determinists had Multiculturalists today decry any recognitionthat some peoples have superior achievements or inferior achievementsat a given time and place though it is blatantly clear that Greeks werefar more advanced than Britons in ancient times and Britons weremore advanced than Greeks in the nineteenth century Today tests thatshow some groups far better at some things than other groups are oftendismissed as biased tests Apparently according to that view somegroups cannot possibly be better or worse than other groups at a giventime or place or at least we cannot publicly admit it 126 Wealth Poverty and PoliticsSuch reactions or overreactions to genetic determinism can beespecially harmful to groups that are lagging since it turns theirattention and energies away from the many available ways in whichthey can improve themselves and their prospects as other lagginggroups have done before them sometimes rising dramatically andinstead leads them into the blind alley of resentments and lashing outat othersSocial Factors 127Chapter 5POLITICAL  FACTORSThe worst political blunder in the history ofcivilization was probably the decision of theemperor of China in the year 1433 to stopexploring the oceans and to destroy the shipscapable of exploration and the writtenrecords of their voyages   The decision wasthe result of powerful people pursuingpartisan squabbles and neglecting the longrange interests of the empire This is adisease to which governments of all kindsincluding democracies are fatallysusceptibleFreeman Dyson1In addition to the influence of such longrun or general factors asgeography and culture particular economic and other socialoutcomes can be influenced or even determined by particularindividual happenstances at particular junctures in history Thedecision of the fifteenth century emperor of China to isolate hiscountry from the outside world was just one of those fateful politicaldecisions with unforeseen repercussions that changed the course ofhistory for a whole civilization Such happenstances cut across suchgeneral influences as geography or culture preventing eithergeographic determinism or cultural determinism128The decision of the Spanish government to finance Columbusvoyage across the Atlantic in search of an alternate route to Indiaobviously changed the course of history for the entire WesternHemisphere and to a considerable extent for Europe as well Had theJapanese government not made the fateful decision to bomb PearlHarbor Japan today might be a very different country without thefundamental and enduring social and institutional changes that tookplace during the years of American occupation after Japans defeat inthe Second World WarSometimes the happenstance that changes the course of history isnot a conscious decision but the unpredictable outcome of a crucialmilitary battle between closely matched armies on a chaoticbattlefield where victory could easily have gone to either side Suchwas the battle of Waterloo in 1815 which the victor the Duke ofWellington afterwards called a near run thing But his victoryover Napoleon determined the fate of generations yet unborn incountries across the continent of Europe Had Hitler not been a fanatical antiSemite at a time when manyof the worlds leading nuclear physicists were Jewish the UnitedStates might not have become the first nation with a nuclear bombas a result of the Manhattan Project which was created in response tothe initiative of Jewish physicists who had fled to America to escapemortal dangers in EuropeWhatever the geographic cultural or other influences in a givensociety they are all ultimately constrained by power whethergovernmental power or military power The Roman Empire wasdestroyed by barbarians setting back the economic cultural andtechnological level of Western Europe for centuries It has beenestimated that a thousand years passed before Western Europeregained the standard of living it once had back in the days of theRoman Empire2Political factors affecting the economic level of nations includeboth the presence and the effectiveness of government as aninstitution as well as the particular policies of particular governmentsPolitical Factors 129We take national governments so much for granted today that it iseasy to forget how long it took for ancient village clan or tribalsocieties to coalesce into successively larger groupings over themillennia until eventually such entities as Greece China or Francecould emerge on the world stage Although China emerged in what are from our perspective todayancient times this emergence of nations in general began like mostof what we recognize as civilization in a late and small fraction of theexistence of the human species Moreover the emergence of nationswas not the same everywhere either in timing or completeness Weneed to consider the process by which nations have emerged andthe economic and social consequences of differences in the pace andcompleteness of that political process among different peoples indifferent places and timesTHE  EMERGENCE  OF  NATIONSThere was a China many centuries before there was a Britain orFrance and these European nations in turn predated the UnitedStates by centuries Moreover the process of forming nations has byno means been irreversible Not only was Carthage obliterated by theRomans Poland was just one of the many nations swallowed up bylarger empires and one of the few that was later reconstituted afterthe breakup of dynastic empires in Europe and the Middle East inthe wake of the First World WarThe incentives for moving beyond the ancient bands of huntergatherers and forming successively larger political units over themillennia were both political and economic Larger governing unitsusually mean more powerful units protecting the society or advancingits interests Larger political units also offer economic benefits Tribesor villages can seldom if ever produce and sell in a large enoughvolume to reap the full benefits of lower costs per unit which resultfrom specialization and economies of scale that mass production firms130 Wealth Poverty and Politicsand industries reap if they have a large enough market for a vastoutpouring of their productsCities may be able to reap some of the benefits of specializationwhen there has been a large enough local market for the resultingproduct so that specialized workers are able to devote themselvesfulltime to producing one particular product or engaging in oneparticular process such as printing or weaving But cities have usuallybeen way stations on the road to the creation of nations though thereare still a few citystates even today such as Singapore or MonacoThe economic and social benefits of larger societies do not ensurethat such societies will emerge everywhere In some places and timesthe spontaneous coalescing of smaller groupings into successivelylarger groupings has lagged so far behind the pace of the same processin other contemporary societies that people living in small andvulnerable societies have been simply conquered or enslaved by largerand more powerful societies Among the reasons why some societies coalesce into largerpolitical units at different paces is that some societies are more incommunication and interaction with other societies with greaterfrequency or over wider areas so that their peoples and rulers cancome to know and work with other peoples and rulers over longperiods of time slowly resolving their differences through trial anderror and gradually building up ties that create mutual benefits whichall have incentives to preserve and expandThis process however may be much slower or even nonexistent inregions fragmented geographically as in the Balkan mountains or onsmall islands scattered across a vast sea or in much of subSaharanAfrica with its many limitations on communication and transportationPeoples in such isolated places have usually been slow to create nationson a scale like that of ancient China or the Roman Empire or even ona scale like that of modestsized nations like Italy or ThailandThe radius of trust can be a major factor in the pace and extent towhich small social groupings coalesce into successively larger politicalunits just as it has been a factor in creating larger economic unitsPolitical Factors 131Small mountain communities for example have been especially slowto coalesce into larger governmental units As one geographic studyput it Political solidarity has a hard slow birth in the mountainsbecause of various forces working against political consolidation3These forces working against consolidation into larger politicalunits include a multiplicity of languages and dialects amongfragmented mountain populations4 impeding even simplecommunication Clan tribal and religious differences have likewisefragmented mountain populations along with the geographicisolation of mountain communities from one another whether withor without cultural contrasts among the different settlements Thelimited economic benefits of cooperation between very poormountain communities can also mean reduced incentives toconsolidate There is not the same reward for cooperation orconsolidation as in richer places especially those with contrastingskills and very different natural resources such as make tradebeneficial to all the parties involvedFamily and tribal feuds have long been common among mountainpeoples around the world5 whether in the mountains of Taiwan orAfghanistan or in Americas Appalachian Mountains The geographicfragmentation of mountain peoples has been an obstacle todeveloping a wider radius of trust or even a wider radius of tolerationAmong the consequences of such social fragmentation of populationshave been minute mountain states and dwarf republics in thewords of a noted geographer6Even where there are formally speaking large mountain nationssuch as Afghanistan these are not necessarily nations whose nationalgovernments actually have effective control over all the territory theynominally govern More than a hundred years ago mountainousAfghanistan was described as a region with no sense of unity amongits numerous tribes a situation which offers little hope ofAfghanistan ever developing national cohesion7 Little that hashappened in more than a century since then would contradict thatassessment132 Wealth Poverty and PoliticsPolitical consolidation has sometimes been forced uponfragmented mountain peoples by foreign conquest or by the threat ofsuch conquest which sometimes led to defensive alliances against thatoutside threat But these temporary alliances seldom led to permanentconsolidations into nationhood Switzerland has been a rare exception perhaps due to the manymountain passes into the Swiss Alps8 that kept the people in thesemountains from being as isolated as peoples in many other mountainsaround the world while the large valleys in the Swiss Alps presentedbetter opportunities for large settlements more in touch with eachother and with the outside world9 The dearth of navigable waterwaysin other mountain regions is not the case in Switzerland which hassuch waterways as Lake Geneva and Lake Lucerne lakes asenclosed waterways being inherently navigable unlike rivers andstreams that pour down steep mountain terrainThe empire of the Incas in the Andes Mountains of SouthAmerica was another and even more striking exception to the smallsize of nations in mountainous terrain The Inca Empire covered906000 square kilometers more than 20 times the size ofSwitzerland and roughly the size of France and Germany puttogether10 There were long and large valleys between the mountainranges those valleys in the lower elevations being suitable foragriculture11 This created a very different geographic setting fromthose in other mountains where people are more fragmentedgeographically in small communities kept small by the very limitedamount of arable land in many mountain valleys and by formidablegeographic obstacles to communication and transportationUnlike other mountains lacking major navigable waterways theAndes include Lake Titicaca more than 100 miles long more than900 feet deep and with a surface area of more than 3000 squaremiles12 The peoples living around the enormous perimeter of thislake had ready communication with each other across a navigablewaterway Lake Titicaca has been called the cradle of the IncaEmpire13 and its capital Cuzco was situated between two riversPolitical Factors 133The presence of vast numbers of llamas in some of the mountainvalleys of the Andes gave the Incas small but numerous pack animalsthat were lacking elsewhere in the Western Hemisphere beforeEuropeans arrived with their animals In these settings the Inca Empirebegan and later spread to other geographic settings in western SouthAmerica for a distance of 4000 kilometers from north to south14The imperative to produce specific crops at specific times of theyear and to preserve the resulting food which peoples in temperatezone climates felt for millennia were in the Inca Empire challengessupplied by the peculiar climate of the region where that empireoriginated The unique situation of a vast and high mountain rangelocated in the tropics gave the Incas a unique climate that was quitedifferent from that common in either temperate or tropical zonesThis climate had a seasonality based on great differences in theamount of rainfall at different times of the year even though averagedaytime high temperatures ranged only from 68 degrees to 73 degreesin the Inca capital of CuzcoThis rainfall seasonality plus the vulnerability of crops to droughtand hard frosts due to overnight temperatures that could fall tofreezing levels during the winter as well as changing weatherconditions from one year to the next created the same lifethreateningchallenge faced for millennia by peoples located in the temperatezones The Incas met this challenge by creating large networks of foodstorage facilities scattered throughout their far flung empire and bydeveloping ways of making some perishable foods storable15 Thus thegeographic environment of the Incas produced the same necessity fordeveloping selfdiscipline and human capital in general that peoplesin the temperate zones had to create in order to survive The IncaEmpire was not tropical in any meaningful climatic sense Special local geographic conditions made Switzerland and the IncaEmpire exceptions to the handicaps that kept the peoples in manyother mountains poor backward and unable to create large wellfunctioning political units However mountains are not the onlygeographic feature that can fragment a population and isolate the134 Wealth Poverty and Politicsfragments from one another impeding the formation of nationstatesOther geographically isolated and fragmented regions such as theCanary Islands and much of subSaharan Africa have likewise beenculturally divided with far more different languages than amongsimilar numbers of people living on a broad mainland in readycommunication with each other The Canary Islanders for example were not only poor andbackward ignorant of iron and other metals when the Spaniardsdiscovered them but were also speaking languages in some of theseislands that were unintelligible to people on some other islands in thesame group16 The peoples of subSaharan Africa produced iron morethan a thousand years earlier but were likewise handicapped by amultiplicity of languages In those parts of subSaharan Africa withless severe geographical handicaps larger communities arose than inother parts of tropical Africa As in other regions of the world theselarger and more advanced peoples in subSaharan Africa oftenconquered or enslaved their smaller or less advanced neighbors In China one of the advantages of the written Chinese languageis that it is a nonphonetic language so that peoples who cannotunderstand each others spoken languages or dialects can neverthelesscommunicate with each other in written Chinese From a politicalstandpoint this can facilitate the consolidation of linguisticallydifferent peoples into a larger nationSince power is inherently relative the ability of small political unitsto survive independently depends on the size and power of otherpolitical units within striking distance of them As already notedimpediments to political consolidation have made small societiesvulnerable to both conquest and enslavement Despite widespreadmisconceptions in the United States today that the institution ofslavery was based on race for most of the thousands of years in whichslavery existed around the world it was based on whoever wasvulnerable to enslavement and within striking distance Thus Europeans enslaved other Europeans just as Asians enslavedother Asians and Africans enslaved other Africans while PolynesiansPolitical Factors 135enslaved other Polynesians and the indigenous peoples of the WesternHemisphere enslaved other indigenous peoples of the WesternHemisphere The very word slave derived from the word for Slavswho were enslaved by fellow Europeans for centuries before Africansbegan to be brought in chains to the Western Hemisphere17Africans were not singled out by race for ownership by Europeansthey were resorted to after the rise of nationstates with armies andnavies in other parts of the world reduced the number of places thatcould be raided for slaves without great costs and risks Slaveraidingcontinued in Africa primarily by Africans enslaving other Africansand then in West Africa selling some of their slaves to whites to taketo the Western Hemisphere Meanwhile the growing range of shipsand the growing wealth of nations eventually made economicallyfeasible the transportation of vast numbers of slaves from onecontinent to another creating racial differences between the enslavedand their owners as a dominant pattern in the Western HemisphereSuch a pattern was by no means limited to Europeans owningnonEuropeans however There were many examples of the reversequite aside from vast regions of the earth where neither the slaves northeir owners were either black or white Unprotected coastal settlements in Europe and European sailorsat sea were long vulnerable to slave raids by pirates from the BarbaryCoast of North Africa These pirates enslaved at least a millionEuropeans between 1500 and 180018 That is more than the numberof African slaves transported to the United States and to theAmerican colonies from which it was formed19 The OttomanEmpire set a levy of a certain percentage of young boys from theconquered peoples in Southeastern Europe these boys being takenaway as slaves converted to Islam trained and assigned civil andmilitary duties in the empire20 Nor were these the only white slavesin the Ottoman Empire Among others Circassian women from theCaucasus region were highly prized as concubines by wealthy men inthe Ottoman Empire and such positions were sufficiently prized byCircassians that mothers groomed their daughters for such roles21136 Wealth Poverty and PoliticsThe slow pace of political consolidation in much of subSaharanAfrica left many small and vulnerable societies there whose peoplewere raided and enslaved largely by other Africans from moregeographically favored settings coastal peoples enslaving lessadvanced and less consolidated inland peoples for example22 It wasfrom the coastal peoples of West Africa that whites purchased slaves forshipment to the Western Hemisphere23 In East Africa both Africansand Arabs raided the more vulnerable tribes and enslaved them24Conquest was another fate of smaller or less powerful peoples incountries around the world One of the consequences of imperialismwhether ancient or modern has been that an empire can combinepeoples into larger governmental units than the conquered peoplesever combined into themselves Thus the Roman Empire forexample combined independent tribes in ancient Britain into RomanBritain within a government that covered a great part of the islandThen when the Romans withdrew four centuries later to go defendthe empire that was under attack on the continent of Europe Britainfragmented into tribal areas again and retrogressed economically This pattern would be repeated more than a thousand years laterwhen European imperialism in Asia and Africa collapsed after theSecond World War In Nigeria for example the HausaFulani tribesof the north had never been combined in the same country with theIbos Yorubas and various other tribes in other parts of the countrybefore the British began taking over that region of Africa in the latenineteenth century and named it Nigeria After the British pulled out in 1960 independent Nigeria wasrepeatedly racked by intertribal mob violence a ghastly civil war anda series of military coups and countercoups all of these reflectingtribal hostilities in a country the indigenous peoples never created butwhere they were thrown together under outside imperial rule Thispattern of postindependence polarization and violence was notunique to Nigeria As the international treatise Ethnic Groups inConflict by Donald L Horowitz put it In a large number of excolonial states the independence rally gave way to the ethnic riot25Political Factors 137Geographically Nigeria has been one of the more fortunate regionsof subSaharan Africa Watered by the great Niger River and itsprincipal tributary the Benue and blessed with natural resourcesincluding iron ore and large petroleum deposits the peoples of thatregion had produced iron centuries before the Christian era and haddeveloped their own cities and countries before the British arrivedbut nothing on the scale of the Nigeria that the British created with itstribal antagonisms that had never been resolved but only suppressedunder British rule According to Professor Horowitzs treatiseWhat the colonialists did that was truly profound and far moreimportant for ethnicity was to change the scale of the polity by severalfold The colonies were artificial not because their borders wereindifferent to their ethnic composition but because they were on theaverage many times larger than the political systems they displaced orencapsulated26Like Roman Britain more than a thousand years earlier Nigeriawas an artificial creation of the conquerors and its prosperity andviability were in jeopardy once the conquerors pulled out Nigeria hasmanaged to remain one country but one of the poorest and mostturbulent countries in the world That this is more a product ofpolitical factors than of either geographic handicaps or inherentdeficiencies of its people is suggested by the fact that Nigerians livingin the United States have had an impressive record of successIn 2010 there were some 260000 Nigerians in the US a mere 07percent of the black American population Yet in 2013 20 to 25 percentof the 120 black students at Harvard Business School were Nigerian Asearly as 1999 Nigerians were overrepresented among black students atelite American colleges and universities by a factor of about ten27Nearly onefourth of Nigerian households in the United Stateshave incomes of more than 10000028 With all due allowance forthe fact that immigrants may be different from the people left behindthe contrast between the way Nigerians progress under Americaninstitutions and the way they fail to make comparable progress underthe institutions in their homeland is much like the way the overseas138 Wealth Poverty and PoliticsChinese and the overseas Indians long progressed far better outsidetheir respective homelands This suggests that there may well besimilar reasons that the political structures and practices in Nigeriamay be a major handicap that nullifies the potential of both its peopleand its geographic settingIn Asia British India was a similar story on a larger scale Theextremely heterogeneous peoples living on the Indian subcontinentwere lumped together by their conquerors for their conquerorsconvenience but without the indigenous peoples having resolvedtheir differences and coalesced voluntarily over time into this politicalentity After the British pulled out in 1947 the carnage was evengreater than in Nigeria The number of people killed in the 1947 mobviolence between Hindus and Muslims has been estimated in thevicinity of a million as British India split into a predominantly HinduIndia and a predominantly Muslim Pakistan Nevertheless despite this split aimed at reducing HinduMuslimconflict both India and Pakistan have subsequently been rackedsporadically by internal conflicts between various groups with EastPakistan eventually breaking off to form the new nation of BangladeshOverseas Indians like the overseas Chinese and like the Nigeriansliving in America have long prospered in many other countries aroundthe world where they were free from the political and other constraintsdeficiencies and conflicts of their native land Despite the widespreadpoverty in India Americans of Indian ancestry have the highestincomes of any group tracked by the US Bureau of the Census29Religious groups like Mormons and Jews are not trackedOther multiethnic postcolonial nations that emerged after beingfreed by the breakup of empires have had similar internal turmoilsWhether these nations subsequently split internally as happened withIndia Yugoslavia and Czechoslovakia or remained intact likeNigeria Sri Lanka and the Philippines their internal strife has takenits toll both economically and socially While such historical patterns demonstrate once more the powerfulnegative force of isolation on economic and social development thesePolitical Factors 139patterns also show why the transportation and communicationsrevolutions of the past two centuries cannot undo the effects of earliercenturies or millennia of isolation Even if the transportation andcommunications revolutions were to become as complete in formerlyisolated parts of the world as in other regions that have long had a widercultural universe that cannot undo the fact that peoples living in awider cultural universe have had centuries or millennia to becomeacquainted with other peoples and to work out cooperativerelationships with them while those living in isolation have not The fact that isolated peoples have usually been poorer and morebackward has often meant that transportation and communicationsadvances reached them belatedly and on a smaller scale A lifechanging advance like railroads for example reached parts of EasternEurope and the Balkans only after trains had spread rapidly acrossWestern Europe in the first half of the nineteenth century As late as 1860 there was not a single mile of railroad track southof the Danube and the Sava rivers30 We have already noted that atrain was a complete mystery to people in Japan in 1853 when thatcountry was a poor and backward nation It was a quarter of a centurylater before the first railroad reached Serbia31 Meanwhile in theUnited States even the less industrialized South had a railroad hub inAtlanta which made it a target for General William T Shermansarmy in its devastating march through Georgia during the Civil WarThe often tragic histories of the emergence of multiethnic nationscreated by imperial conquerors should call into question the extent towhich nationbuilding by outsiders is a promising prospect Itshould also cause some second thoughts or perhaps firstthoughts about the endlessly repeated mantra of ethnic diversityas such a source of societal strength that it is a compelling interestfor government in the words of the Supreme Court of the UnitedStates32 Few words have been repeated so often or so insistently asdiversity without a speck of evidence being offered or asked for tosubstantiate its claims of economic or social benefits And theevidence to the contrary is huge 140 Wealth Poverty and PoliticsSeldom if ever do advocates of demographic diversity comparethe actual empirical record of the costs and benefits of such diversityin countries around the world India with its vast array of ethniclinguistic caste and other subdivisions of its population should havegreat advantages over an extremely homogeneous society like Japan ifdiversity is such a benefit but there is little empirical evidence thatthis is so and much empirical evidence to the contrary In India as ina number of subSaharan nations there is no given language spokenby even half the population and mass intergroup violence has by nomeans been unusual It is an important and commendable achievement for a nation toovercome problems common to multiethnic societies but that is verydifferent from claiming that multiple ethnicities in a nation areautomatically a net benefit A closer look at politically polarizedmultiethnic societies raises many painful questions This is nowheremore clearly or more distressingly apparent than in countries whereone racial or ethnic group is strikingly more prosperous than othersand where that fact is politicizedTHE  POLITICS  OF  POLARIZATIONDisparities in income and wealth whether within nations orbetween nations can arise from many causes However the presumedcauses that are politically popular have tended to be those whichinvolve the less fortunate being victims of the more fortunate Generalcauses such as geography demography and culture have no suchpolitical attraction as explanations despite whatever causal weightthey may have in factIt might seem as if every society whether rich or poor can always usegreater productivity wherever it is available But it only seems that wayPolitically there is a major problem especially in a poor country whensome racially or socially distinct group has markedly higher levels ofskills or economic experience than that in the rest of the population Political Factors 141From an economic perspective this situation presents a valuableopportunity for the more productive portion of the population tosupply much needed human capital to enable the economy as a wholeto become more productive creating benefits for the population atlarge Moreover the presence of people with such human capital alsopresents an opportunity for individuals in the rest of a society toacquire some of this human capital themselves whether by exampleby working with or observing the more productive group or bystudying to acquire such skills in educational institutions Knowledgeis one of the few things that can be transferred to others without thosefrom whom it is transferred having any less remaining for themselvesFrom a political perspective however the situation is entirelydifferent As noted in Chapter 3 when more productive groups freelycompete in a market economy this leads to visible disparities ineconomic outcomes that are resented by the less successful groupsPolitical leaders in many lagging countries have been keenly aware ofthis prospect A political leader of the Malays in Malaysia for example saidcandidly Whatever the Malays could do the Chinese could dobetter and more cheaply33 This provided a political rationale forimposing preferential policies for the benefit of the Malays which isto say discrimination against the Chinese in Malaysia This samepolitical leader observedThese few Malays for they are still only very few have waxed rich notbecause of themselves but because of the policy of a Governmentsupported by a huge majority of poor Malays It would seem that theefforts of the poor Malays have gone to enrich a select few of their ownpeople The poor Malays themselves have not gained one iota But ifthese few Malays are not enriched the poor Malays will not gain eitherIt is the Chinese who will continue to live in huge houses and regard theMalays as only fit to drive their cars With the existence of the few richMalays at least the poor Malays can say that their fate is not entirely toserve rich nonMalays From the point of view of racial ego and this egois still strong the unseemly existence of Malay tycoons is essential34142 Wealth Poverty and PoliticsPolitical Factors 143What is involved in such reactions is not simply poverty or envy butresentment If the issue was envy then it would be hard to explain thepride that Malays have had in their own wealthy Malay sultans35Sultans are in a much more enviable position than most Chinese inMalaysia The sultans are likely to be wealthier and their wealth hascome by inheritance rather than by personal achievement But personalachievement is much more of a threat to the egos of others thaninheritance is not only in Malaysia but elsewhere In the United States for example three heirs to the Rockefellerfortune have been elected governors of three different states and twoRoosevelts with inherited wealth have been elected President of theUnited States It is the Asian immigrants of a later time many ofwhom have been refugees who in many cases arrived on Americanshores with little money and a few words of broken English but whohave worked their way up from the bottom to a modest prosperityand whose children excel in school and then head off to prestigiousuniversities who are threats to the egos of lagging groups in Americawho have made nothing like the same use of their own opportunitiesKorean immigrants to the United States for example worked anaverage of 63 hours per week as storekeepers in Atlanta with onefifth of them working 80 hours or more36 In New York Koreangreengrocers have gone out to pick up their fruits and vegetables fromwholesalers at 400 AM enabling them to select the best of thesefruits and vegetables and to save on delivery charges that othergreengrocers had to pay37The children of such Asian families have shown a similar work ethicin school and have provoked the same resentments by their superioracademic achievements as adult high achievers have provoked inmembers of lagging groups in countries around the world Children ofAsian families have for years been beaten up by black classmates in thepublic schools of New York and Philadelphia38 with little or nothingbeing done by the authorities to stop it and no editorial indignationabout it from people in the media who are quick to cry racism at anypassing remark that can be construed as critical of any of the groupscurrently in favor among the intelligentsia Like the Asian immigrants to America today Jewish Lebanese andJapanese immigrants have at various times in the past arrived in variouscountries around the world with little money but much human capitaland prospered as a result provoking resentments among those whowere there before them and who made no similar use of their ownopportunities There have also been examples of the same socialphenomena among groups who migrated within their own country androse to prosperity and who were likewise resented The Marwaris andBengalis in various parts of India Armenians in the Ottoman Empireas well as Ibos in Nigeria and Tamils in Sri Lanka are among otherexamples of the same social phenomenon39In many countries the political priority of protecting majority groupegos has trumped the economic or other benefits of making use of thebest skills and talents available in the economy After Nigeria becameindependent in 1960 a high political priority among the HausaFulanipeoples in northern Nigeria was to get rid of the Ibos from southernNigeria who had dominated professions and skilled occupations innorthern Nigeria under British rule Ibos were driven out of northernNigeria often to the accompaniment of lethal mob violence even whenthere were not enough qualified northern Nigerians to replace the Ibosand European expatriates had to be hired to take their place instead40In the same vein when Romania acquired territory from thedefeated Central Powers after the First World War this territoryincluded universities that were culturally German or culturallyHungarian The Romanian government made it a political priority toforce Germans and Hungarians out of these universities even thoughmost Romanians were still illiterate at that point and so could notreplace the Germans or Hungarians41 The expulsion of Asians fromUganda in the 1970s led to the collapse of the Ugandan economybecause there were not nearly enough qualified Ugandans to replacethem in the business sector that people from the Indian subcontinenthad dominated for generations42144 Wealth Poverty and PoliticsThese were not isolated examples Distinguished developmenteconomist Peter Bauer of the London School of Economics whostudied Third World countries for years reported a general pattern inthose countries of persecution of the most productive groupsespecially minorities and sometimes their expulsion43However much productive minority groups might benefit anational economy in a poor country their marked success threatensthe egos of the lagging majority provoking often bitter resentmentsIn Bolivia a terrorist of indigenous descent when asked why he wasengaging in terrorist activity replied So that my daughter will nothave to be your maid44 When the new nation of Czechoslovakia wascreated out of the dissolution of the Habsburg Empire after the FirstWorld War one of the new Czech leaders first political priorities waspreferential treatment of Czechs which meant discriminationagainst Germans setting in motion a series of major tragedies forboth Czechs and Germans over the next three decades45If poverty or envy were the fundamental problem then a moreproductive economy and a spreading of productive skills to thosewithout them might seem to be the answer But neither of thesethings can cure resentments at being in a galling inferior position For those seething with such resentments it is not sufficient tohave a rising standard of living From the standpoint of resenters thepriority is that those in a superior position must be brought downEven the killing of the more fortunate is often not consideredsufficient They must be made to suffer both physical agonies andpersonal humiliations to bring them down to the level of those whoattack them and below That has been a common pattern whetherthe targets of violent actions have been the Chinese in thePhilippines Armenians in the Ottoman Empire Jews in NaziGermany or Tutsis in Rwanda among othersThe Chinese in the Philippines are among the many productivegroups whose economic success has led to violent backlashes As aninternational study notedPolitical Factors 145146 Wealth Poverty and PoliticsIn the Philippines millions of Filipinos work for Chinese almost noChinese work for Filipinos The Chinese dominate industry andcommerce at every level of society Global markets intensify thisdominance When foreign investors do business in the Philippines theydeal almost exclusively with Chinese Apart from a handful of corruptpoliticians and a few aristocratic Spanish mestizo families all of thePhilippines billionaires are of Chinese descent By contrast all menialjobs in the Philippines are filled by Filipinos All peasants are FilipinosAll domestic servants and squatters are Filipinos46The same study also noted Hundreds of Chinese in thePhilippines are kidnapped every year almost invariably by ethnicFilipinos Many victims often children are brutally murdered evenafter ransom is paid47A study of the Ottoman Empire described the mass slaughters ofArmenians by Turkish mobs in 1894 including bayoneting the mento death raping the women dashing their children against therocks48 In 1915 there was a death march imposed on Armenians inwhich thousands perished many of the women were stripped nakedand forced to walk into the city that way49It was much the same pattern in Rwanda in the late twentiethcentury when the Hutus slaughtered hundreds of thousands of TutsisYoung children were often killed in front of their parents by cuttingoff one arm then the other A United Nations official reported Theywould then gash the neck with a machete to bleed the child slowly todeath but while they were still alive they would cut off the privateparts and throw them at the faces of the terrified parents who wouldthen be murdered with slightly greater dispatch50 Such atrocities reflect vengeful resentments that cannot beassuaged by a higher Gross Domestic Product per capita The feelingsbehind ghastly acts of revenge are not simply envy but resentmentslashing out at those whose success has inflicted a galling position ofinferiority and wounded feelings of inferiority on those who resentYet it is also a puzzling and disturbing fact that some groups whoinflicted horrific atrocities on others had previously coexisted peacefullyfor years or even generations with those who eventually became targetsof their rage The Times of India for example referred to neighboursPolitical Factors 147leading longtime friends to gory deaths during intergroup outbreaks ofviolence in Mumbai Bombay in 1992199351Such disturbing patterns not only raise sobering questions abouthow secure any apparent detente between racial or ethnic groups is infact These patterns also suggest that some catalyst may be needed toarouse the feelings behind the horrors and of course no one canknow in advance when any such catalyst may arise even in the mosttranquil settings whether that catalyst appears in the form of aparticular episode or a particular skilled and talented demagogueWhen Sri Lanka achieved independence in 1948 its main ethnicgroups were seen by observers both inside and outside the country ashaving good even cordial relations with one another52 There hadbeen no riot between the Sinhalese majority and the Tamil minorityduring the previous halfcentury The educated and Westernizedelites of both groups lived peacefully in the same Westernizedresidential enclaves Nevertheless within a decade after Sri Lanka emerged fromBritish rule as an independent nation in 1948 an ambitious politiciannamed Solomon Bandaranaike seeking the prime ministership byturning the Sinhalese majority against the more prosperous Tamilminority set in motion group polarizations that escalated into mobviolence and then a civil war that lasted a quarter of a century withunspeakable atrocities on both sides Bandaranaike was the catalystLike many others who played that deadly role in other countriesBandaranaike was by no means one of the embittered poor himselfHe was from an elite background and was skilled in whipping upother peoples emotions for his own political purposesMuch discussion of policies toward Third World countriesproceeds as if the fundamental problem in such countries is poverty  Once his purposes were served that is he became prime ministerBandaranaike was willing to back off the extremism he had aroused But theemotions he had whipped up could not be turned off and acquired a life of theirown When Bandaranaike moderated his stance toward the Tamils after gettingelected he was assassinated by a Buddhist extremist and the polarization processcontinued to escalate into a devastating civil warand a lack of the skills and knowledge required to raise their standardof living Supplying money physical equipment and technocrats withskills might seem to be the answer as policies to help Third Worldcountries advance But many if not most poor countries already havewithin their own borders people with the human capital to advancethe nations economy Yet there are formidable political obstacles tousing that human capital and many political incentives to avoidletting minorities with skills lacking in the majority population havefree rein to put their skills to work with resulting disparities inperformances and rewardsIn the most varied conditions in countries around the worldwhether in Third World countries or in economically more advancedcountries and whether in countries where the majority or theminority has the higher skills those seeking either the leadership orthe votes of lagging groups tend to offer them four things1 Assurance that their lags are not their fault2 Assurance that their lags are the fault of someadvanced group that they already envy and resent3 Assurance that the lagging group and their cultureare just as good as anybody elses if not better4 Assurance that what the lagging group needs anddeserves is a demographically defined fair share ofthe economic and other benefits of societysometimes supplemented with some kind ofreparations for past injustices or some specialreward for being indigenous sons of the soilEconomic competition in the marketplace can financially punishpeople whose beliefs differ from reality but competition for votes atelection time can politically punish people who assert a reality thatdiffers from popular beliefs In addition racial or ethnic leaders haveevery incentive to promote the isolation of the groups they lead148 Wealth Poverty and Politicsdespite the fact that isolation has been a major factor in the povertyand backwardness of many different peoples around the worldWhere a lagging group is concentrated in a particular region of acountry leaders of such groups have incentives to promote secessionfrom the more advanced part of the country as Slovaks seceded fromCzechoslovakia and as East Pakistanis seceded from Pakistan tocreate the new nation of Bangladesh Despite the economic losses thatpoorer groups may sustain when they are no longer part of a moreadvanced economy their political leaders gain from acquiring morepower as leaders of a nation and have every incentive to promotenational pride in independent nationhood whether or not that hasmade the people they lead better off or worse off economically Thepeople themselves may also benefit psychically by being spared thepublic embarrassment and private shame of being visiblyoutperformed repeatedly by others in the same economy and societyWhere the political situation makes secession unlikely to happenleaders of lagging groups have every incentive to promote culturalisolation such as laws or policies in parts of the United Statesrequiring the teaching of Hispanic children in the Spanish languageeven when their parents want them taught in English so as tofacilitate their rise in the American economy and society53Perhaps the most culturally isolated of all American ethnic groupsare those descendants of the indigenous American Indian populationwho still live on reservations with great legal autonomy but withlower per capita incomes than blacks Hispanics or other AmericanIndians who are not living on reservations Since the 1980s AmericanIndians living off reservations who are a substantial majority of allAmerican Indians have had per capita incomes slightly higher thanthose of Hispanic Americans while American Indians living onreservations have had substantially lower per capita incomes thanblack or Hispanic Americans and less than half that of the Americanpopulation as a whole54 Yet leaders of American Indian reservationsjealously guard their prerogatives and promote the perpetuation ofseparate cultures among the populations of these reservations Political Factors 149Racial or ethnic leaders also have incentives to blame advancedgroups for the lags of lagging groups The behavior of advancedgroups toward lagging groups has by no means always beenexemplary nor necessarily even decent so the leaders of lagginggroups may have many things to complain about without thosethings necessarily being the reasons for the economic educational orother gaps between the advanced groups and the lagging groups In particular circumstances some advanced group may in fact bethe cause of holding back some lagging group But that cannot beassumed a priori from the fact that one group is demonstrably moresuccessful economically or in other ways Even where the advancedgroup has behaved badly toward the lagging group as has oftenhappened in many countries around the world that is still not proofthat the lagging group would have been better off economically in theabsence of the advanced group The ancient Romans certainly behaved abominably toward theancient Britons whom they conquered But that is not to say that theRomans were the reason that the Britons lagged It was only the factthat the Britons lagged before the Romans arrived and conqueredthem that permitted a numerically smaller Roman military force tooverwhelm a numerically larger British force both during theconquest and later when there was a mass uprising of the Britishprovoked by the Romans oppression In putting down that uprisingthe Romans slaughtered Britons by the thousands and the queen whohad led the uprising committed suicide to avoid the retribution sheknew she could expect from the Romans Yet in modern times evensuch a British patriot as Winston Churchill could say We oweLondon to Rome55 because the ancient Britons were not yet capableof creating such a city themselvesNo one believes that slaves were always treated well in the manytimes and places around the world where there were slaves There istoo much documented evidence that they were not But the fact thatblack Americans today have a far higher standard of living than thepeoples of subSaharan Africa from which they are descended is not150 Wealth Poverty and Politicsa happenstance Nor can this outcome retroactively justify slavery anymore than the valuable advantages that Western Europeansdescendants received as a cultural legacy from Roman conquests canretroactively justify the Romans brutal oppression of their ancestors Neither can individuals or groups lagging today automaticallyblame their lags on the injustices inflicted on their ancestors whenthe cultural benefits available to them in later times were anunintended byproduct of those injustices Moral condemnation isnot causal explanation despite how often the two have beencombined in a politically attractive package Despite the tendency ofpolitical and especially ideological explanations of economicdisparities to combine moral and causal factors the reason so manymountain peoples around the world have been poor has not been thatothers went up into those mountains and took away their wealth butthat the mountain peoples seldom produced much wealth in the firstplace The Spaniards seizing the wealth of the Incas was an exceptionon a horrific scale but empirically it was not the ruleThe one thing that can be said unequivocally about the past is thatit is irrevocable When both history and the contemporary worldscene show what a challenge it can be to create or maintain decentrelations among contemporaries it is staggering that some peopleimagine that they can take on the far larger task of righting thewrongs of the past committed by people long dead without ignitingdangerous new hostilities among the livingTHE  WELFARE  STATE The welfare state is often seen in terms of its effects on thematerial wellbeing of individuals or groups However it can also havean effect on the productivity of a nation as a whole and therefore onthe standard of living of its people in general Moreover the welfarestates effects extend beyond economics to social behavior with majorimpacts on both the recipients of welfare benefits and those whoPolitical Factors 151152 Wealth Poverty and Politicsinteract with them These effects are not due solely to the welfarestate as such but often to the social vision that accompanies thewelfare state and changes the way many people see the worldThe Welfare State VisionIn a democratic country a welfare state can be created only after awelfare state vision is created and prevails politically Therefore inassessing the effect of a welfare state we must include the effects ofthat vision as well as the effects of the particular institutions andpolicies created Among the assumptions behind the welfare statevision two seem crucial 1 many people are mired in a degree ofpoverty that a prosperous society can and should relieve and 2many if not most of the people in poverty never had the same chanceof a better life as others who ended up more prosperous Even in a society with rules that are fair in the sense of judgingeveryone by the same standards and rewarding or punishing themaccording to the same criteria it would still be true that someone bornin the South Bronx would have nothing like the same probability ofachieving economic success however defined as someone born inan elegant Park Avenue neighborhood To be fair in the sense ofproviding equal probabilities of success for people born in unequalsocial circumstances would be very different In that sense life hasbeen unfair in virtually every society of the past or the present The case for the welfare state vision has seldom been made moreclearly than by Nicholas Kristof of the New York TimesOne delusion common among Americas successful people is that theytriumphed just because of hard work and intelligenceIn fact their big break came when they were conceived in middleclass American families who loved them read them stories and nurturedthem with Little League sports library cards and music lessons Theywere programmed for success by the time they were zygotes56The social conditions into which individuals are born and raisedare of course not equal just as the geographic demographic andPolitical Factors 153cultural conditions in which individuals groups and nations findthemselves are not equal in their economic prospects This has beentrue throughout recorded history No doubt many of us wish thatthings were different and some want to do something about it Buteverything depends on just what specifically is the something that isdone The welfare state is just one option among manyMr Kristof s response to the unfairness of life is to criticize thosewho are oblivious of their own advantages and of other peoplesdisadvantages He accuses them of a meanspiritedness in thepolitical world or at best a lack of empathy toward those strugglingpartly explaining the hostility to state expansion of Medicaid to longterm unemployment benefits or to raising the minimum wage tokeep up with inflation57 In short Kristof s response to theunfairness of life is a government transfer of resources from those whoare more prosperous to those who are less prosperous with nocaveats about the further consequences of such welfare state policiesor its accompanying vision and no apparent apprehension aboutwhether those consequences will make either the less prosperous orsociety at large better off or worse off on net balanceTo blithely assume that the only reason to be against minimumwage laws is a lack of empathy with the poor is to ignore a vastliterature on the negative repercussions of minimum wage laws Theserepercussions include increased numbers of unemployed young malesidle on the streets which is seldom a benefit to any community Ten years after passage of the federal minimum wage law in theUnited States the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938 the wartimeinflation in the intervening years had so raised prices and wages thatthe minimum wage specified in that law was below whatinexperienced and unskilled workers were already being paid so thatby 1948 the economic situation in most places was the same as if therewere no minimum wage law The unemployment rate among black16 and 17yearolds that year was just under 10 percent But in lateryears as the minimum wage was repeatedly raised to keep up withinflation unemployment among blacks this age never again fell below20 percent It was 27 percent a decade later in 1958 and 45 percent in197558 It is one of the most elementary principles of economics thatprices artificially raised above the level set by supply and demandcreates unsaleable surpluses whether what is being sold is agriculturalproduce or labor regardless of the presence or absence of empathyDespite a common claim advanced by Kristof among many othersthat Slavery and postslavery oppression left a legacy of brokenfamilies among blacks59 the plain fact is that the proportion of blackchildren living with only one parent was never as large during the firsthundred years after slavery as it became in the first thirty years afterthe great expansion of the welfare state beginning in the 1960s Yetthe legacy of slavery argument continues to be blithely repeated andthe legacy of the welfare state ignoredThe proportion of black children being raised by a single motherin 1960 was 22 percent Thirtyfive years later that proportion hadrisen to 52 percent being raised by a mother alone 4 percent beingraised by a father alone and another 11 percent being raised withneither parent present altogether 67 percent of all black children60By 1995 the proportion of black children in povertylevel familieswho were being raised without a father present was 85 percent61The central rationale for the welfare state is poverty But if theword is to have any specific meaning someone must define it inspecific terms Once that is done poverty means no more and no lessthan those specifications however much the word may conjure upimages from a past era when poverty meant hunger ragged clothingcramped housing and the like Today poverty in America meanswhatever government statisticians in Washington say it means andthey are unlikely to define it in ways that would jeopardize the welfarestate of which they are partMost people living below the official poverty line in the UnitedStates in 2001 had central air conditioning and a microwave oven forexample In fact these items were more common among the officiallypoor in 2001 than they were among the American population as awhole in 1980 Most povertylevel households in 2001 had cable154 Wealth Poverty and Politicstelevision and two or more television sets As of 2003 nearly threefourths of officially povertylevel households owned at least onemotor vehicle and 14 percent owned two or more62 In contrast totimes past when lowincome people lived in overcrowded dwellingsAmericans living below the official poverty level today have morehousing space per person than the average European not poorEuropeans but the average European63 As a scholar who spent yearsstudying Latin America put it the poverty line in the United Statesis the uppermiddle class in Mexico64This is not to say that Americans living in official poverty have noproblems They have serious and often catastrophic social problemsbut these are seldom the result of material deprivation and are farmore often a result of social degeneration much of it representingsocial retrogressions during the era of the rising welfare state and ofthe pervasive nonjudgmental welfare state ideologyProgress and RetrogressionsBlack Americans a group often identified as beneficiaries of thewelfare state in America made considerable economic progress in thetwentieth century but much if not most of it was prior to the massiveexpansion of the American welfare state beginning with the war onpoverty programs of the 1960s Progress for most blacks can be measured from the time of theEmancipation Proclamation of 1863 That progress was slow butsteady By 1900 a majority of black Americans were literatesomething that would not be true of the population of Romania untildecades later and of the population of India until more than half acentury after that As of 1910 about onefourth of black farmers wereowners or buyers of their land rather than renters or sharecroppers65Herbert Gutmans monumental treatise The Black Family in Slaveryand Freedom 17501925 showed that during the era from 1880 to1925 the typical AfroAmerican family was lowerclass in status andheaded by two parents In 1925 just 3 percent of black families inPolitical Factors 155New York were headed by a woman under thirty66 The unwedteenage mother became common in a later generation during the eraof the expanded welfare stateThe reasons for black poverty often very real poverty in earlieryears especially are not hard to find It was 1930 before the averageblack adult had six years of education67 mostly in inferior Southernschools At that time only 19 percent of black children of high schoolage in the South actually went to high school68 It was 1924 beforethe first permanent public high school for black children was built inAtlanta69 after years of campaigns by the local black communityAs of 1940 87 percent of black families in the United States livedbelow the poverty line But this declined to 47 percent by 1960 as blackeducation and urban job experience increased in the wake of the massmigrations of blacks out of the South This 40 percentage point drop inthe black poverty rate occurred prior to both the civil rights laws andthe war on poverty social welfare programs of the 1960s Over thenext 20 years from 1960 to 1980 the black poverty rate dropped anadditional 18 points70 significant but the continuation of a preexisting trend at a slower pace rather than being a new result from newcivil rights laws and welfare state policies as so often claimedThere were dramatic increases in the number of black electedofficials in the South after passage of the Voting Rights Act of 1965But nothing similarly dramatic occurred in black economicadvancement as a result of the civil rights laws of the 1960s In someimportant social ways actual retrogressions set inArguably the most consequential of these social retrogressions wasthe decline in twoparent families We have also seen in Chapter 4some declines in black educational achievements during this later erasuch as a decline in the proportion of black students in New YorksStuyvesant High School to onetenth of what they had been in earlieryears In addition there was an increase in crime and violenceincluding ghetto riots The first in a series of such riots across thecountry erupted in Los Angeles just days after the Voting Rights Actof 1965 was passed156 Wealth Poverty and PoliticsThis eruption of violence was contrary to the prevailing politicaland social vision of the times in which problems among blacks wereautomatically assumed to be due to deficiencies in the way whitepeople treated them But such riots were less common in the South71where racial discrimination in laws and practices remained morecommon By contrast the worst of these riots with 43 people killed33 of whom were black occurred in Detroit where the blackunemployment rate was 34 percent and black home ownership washigher than in any other major city72 Yet no such facts made a dentin the prevailing social visionThe proliferation of black politicians and of community activistsprovided a great increase of leaders promoting the same kind ofvision that ethnic leaders have promoted to many other lagginggroups in many other countries around the world That vision is onein which the lagging groups problems are due primarily if not solelyto the malign actions of other groups The answers offered to blacksin America have been in principle despite local variations verymuch like the answers offered to Czechs in nineteenth centuryBohemia Sinhalese in twentieth century Sri Lanka Maoris in NewZealand and many others elsewhere group solidarity in pursuit ofcollective political solutions and in the meantime resistance to thecultures of those who are more fortunate The actual track record of that approach as compared to otherapproaches used by other groups has received virtually no attentionfrom either black leaders or the black or white intelligentsia in eitherthe media or academia A list of groups that have risen from poverty toprosperity in countries around the world the Chinese LebaneseJews and Japanese for example would usually also be a list of groupsthat played very little role in politics during their rise though a few oftheir members in later times could afford the luxury of political careersBut even then those political careers were seldom based on beingspokesmen for their respective groups in the political arena Germans in Australia Brazil and the United States were long notedfor their unusually low interest in politics while their interest inPolitical Factors 157education and in otherwise advancing themselves economically was thefocus of their attention Even when some Americans of Germanancestry became prominent in politics the Muhlenbergs in theeighteenth century Carl Schurz and John Peter Altgeld in thenineteenth century and Herbert Hoover and Dwight D Eisenhower inthe twentieth century they did not do so as spokesmen for theGerman American community but as people addressing issues facingthe American population as a whole In the period up through the FirstWorld War Germans in Brazil seldom bothered to vote73 Even whenGermans were politically attacked as a group in nineteenth centuryBohemia their first response was to defend a cosmopolitan outlook andonly belatedly did they defend themselves specifically as Germans74It was very much the same story with the overseas Chinese inSoutheast Asia and the Western Hemisphere political apathy andfierce concentration on work education and saving The sameunromantic but very effective concentration on work education andsaving lifted Jewish Japanese and Lebanese immigrants from povertyto prosperity in various countries around the world It also liftedindigenous minorities like the Ibos in Nigeria Tamils in Sri Lankaand Armenians in the Ottoman Empire among othersConversely one of the most politically successful groups inAmerica the Irish did not rise from poverty as fast as other groupsthat were neither as involved politically nor as successful in politics asthe Irish were Irish politicians reached influential positions in midnineteenth century American cities and within a few decades the Irishwere dominant in big city political machines in Boston New York andother cities across the country and remained so well into the twentiethcentury This brought prosperity prominence and power to a few butthe great majority of the Irish continued to lag behind other Americanseconomically and even behind some other immigrant groups At the beginning of the twentieth century 39 percent of the Irishin New York City were unskilled laborers the highest percentagefor any ethnic group in New York at that time An additional 25percent were classified as semiskilled75 At the same time 71 percent158 Wealth Poverty and Politicsof firstgeneration Irish women in New York worked as domestic orpersonal servants as did 25 percent of secondgeneration Irishwomen76 As of 1930 the proportion of the Irish who paid more thana hundred dollars a month in rent was barely more than half theproportion among Russians most of whom were Jews during thisera and less than half the proportion among Germans77 This wasdespite the fact that the peak of Irish immigration to America camedecades before the peak of Jewish immigration so that the Irish hadhad a longer time to rise in American society However plausible or even inspiring it might seem that a laggingminority needs to unite in solidarity behind political leadersrepresenting their interests to the larger society in order to get aheadthe historical record shows no such pattern of success for politics ascompared to education job skills and intact familiesDespite the ease with which some use the legacy of slaveryargument to explain negative features of black communities today thereis seldom any attempt to examine the facts as to whether whatever iscomplained of whether fatherless families crime rates or other socialpathology was in fact worse in the first hundred years after slavery orin the first generation after the triumph of the welfare state vision in the1960s The homicide fatality rate among nonwhites the vast majorityof whom in this era were blacks killed by other blacks rose sharplyduring the 1960s after having declined substantially during the 1950s In1950 the homicides per 100000 people were 455 among nonwhitemales and this fell to 345 in 1960 followed by a rise to 608 in 197078Other retrogressions followed in the wake of the disintegration oftwoparent families These retrogressions included rising rates ofwelfare dependency79 unemployment80 crimes81 and organized mobviolence against whites and Asians in dozens of cities and townsacross the country82 While black civil rights organizations and theblack public had long been opposed to racism nevertheless groupidentity politics eventually led to a situation in which a public opinionpoll in 2013 found that more blacks saw their fellow blacks as racistthan saw whites as racist83Political Factors 159During the first half of the twentieth century black migrants fromthe South were ridiculed by Northern blacks when they did not speakstandard English or when their behavior in other respects betrayed alower level of education or sophistication Black newspapers and blackcivic organizations like the Urban League tried to acculturate lesseducated lowerclass blacks to the norms of the larger society84 muchas Irish and Jewish civic organizations during the immigrant era triedto acculturate their respective compatriots to the norms of the largersociety85In the second half of the twentieth century however with thespread of the nonjudgmental multicultural doctrine that all culturesare equally valid and equally deserved to be celebrated to repudiatethe ghetto culture was now seen as a racial betrayal by blacks whowere acting white Now even more educated and more acculturatedblacks especially among the young felt a need to adopt or affectsome patterns or norms from the ghetto culture as a sign of racialsolidarity or at least to avoid social friction In short the acculturationprocess now reversed in favor of the lowest common denominator asthe influence of the ghetto culture spread up the social scale leadingto social retrogressions visible in many waysTelevision documentaries about black communities in the first halfof the twentieth century may show noticeably poorer neighborhoodsthan today with fewer cars parked on the streets but usuallyneighborhoods without graffiti or bars on windows Neither theresidents of Harlem nor whites who visited Harlem faced the level ofdangers in the first half of the twentieth century that became commonand pervasive in Harlem and other black communities in later yearsDuring the 1920s for example many white celebrities frequentedHarlems entertainment centers and private parties into the wee hoursof the morning before returning to their homes downtown often justbefore dawn Many had their own cars but music critic Carl VanVechten a frequent visitor to Harlem simply went out on thestreets often intoxicated to hail a cab to take him back to his west55th Street apartment86 In the early 1930s when Milton Friedman160 Wealth Poverty and Politicswas a graduate student at Columbia University he and his future wifewent dancing at the Savoy Ballroom in Harlem with no fear of beingmugged or accosted as he said in later years87 A black actress wholived in Harlem and performed in Manhattans midtown theaterdistrict during the 1940s said At one in the morning I would betaking the Eighth Avenue subway up getting off at the top of theHill I had no fears whatsoever88 It is hard even to imagine suchthings in Harlem or other ghettos across the country todayPublic housing projects were a particularly striking setting inwhich social retrogressions among blacks took place The filthycrimeridden violenceprone housing projects full of singleparentfamilies on welfare that became common across the country in thesecond half of the twentieth century were by no means the normduring the first half of the twentieth century There were de factoracially segregated projects in both eras Yet the earlier projects werea striking contrast with the later projects during an era of nonjudgmental admissions policies toward applicants for apartments inthe projects As the New York Times reported looking back on NewYorks earlier projectsThese were not the projects of idle stinky elevators of gangcontrolledstairwells where drug deals go down In the 1940s 50s and 60s whenmost of the citys public housing was built a sense of pride andcommunity permeated wellkept corridors apartments and grounds89It was not simply the physical setting that was different So was theway of life in those early housing projectsDoors were kept unlocked as kids bounced from one apartment to thenext on rainy Saturdays to watch Laurel and Hardy and HopalongCassidy on television90This was an era when not everyone could afford a television setbut when many people in the housing projects of that era who didhave a television set felt safe enough to leave their apartment doorsPolitical Factors 161unlocked on Saturday mornings so that their childrens friends couldcome visit to watch television with them There was a similar atmosphere in Philadelphia housing projectsof that era as described by black economist Walter Williams whogrew up in a housing project thereBack in the 40s the Homes were not what they were to become alocation known for drugs killings and nighttime sounds of gunfire Oneof the most noticeable differences back then compared to today was themakeup of the resident families Most of the children we played withunlike my sister and I lived with both parents More than likely therewere other singleparent households but I can recall none Fathersworked and the mothers often did as well The buildings and yards werewell kept91There was no graffiti in this project On hot summer nights it wasnot uncommon for people to sleep out on the balconies or in the caseof firstfloor apartments in their yards In the adjoining local blackneighborhood it was not uncommon to see old men sitting around atable out on the street on

inparts of the United States as well as the retrogressions represented byfamily disintegration rising drug addiction violence and criminalbehavior have been strikingly similar among lowerclass whites inEngland Moreover these and other social retrogressions proliferatedduring the same time period from the 1960s onward on bothsides of the Atlantic A whole way of life among lowerclass whites inEngland remarkably similar to the way of life in black ghettos in theUnited States has been detailed in a classic account Life at the Bottomby Theodore Dalrymple a British physician who worked in a hospitalnear a lowincome housing project and in a prison As regards the housing projects he observed The public spacesand elevators of all public housing blocks I know are so deeplyimpregnated with urine that the odor is ineradicable And anythingsmashable has been smashed95 The physical degeneration of thepremises has been matched by social degeneration among the peopleliving in them The unmarried mother with multiple children bymultiple fathers none of whom support their children financially orin any other way has become common in lowincome whiteneighborhoods in England As for the behavior of such children inEngland Dr Dalrymple recounted the troubles of a 50yearold ladywho lived alone in a slum and was a patient of hisThe children in her street mock her unceasingly when she leaves herhouse they push excrement through her mailbox as a joke She has longsince given up appealing to their mothers for help since they always side164 Wealth Poverty and Politicswith their children and consider any adverse comment on their behavioras an insult to them personally Far from correcting their children theythreaten her with further violence96Putting excrement through someones mailbox was not an isolatedaberration but a common expression of social disapproval amongsuch people97 In the schools a common expression of socialdisapproval of those few students who seriously try to learn is beatingthem up the same treatment meted out in America to some ghettochildren who are accused of acting white Some of the lowincomewhite children in England were beaten so badly by other lowincomewhite children as to require medical treatment at the hospital whereDr Dalrymple worked98 Crime in England likewise skyrocketed in the second half of thetwentieth century In 1954 there was a total of 12 armed robberies inLondon including 8 where the weapon was not real at a timewhen anybody could buy a shotgun there England had long beenknown as one of the worlds most lawabiding nations But thenumber of armed robberies rose to 1400 in 1981 and 1600 in 199199in an era of severe restrictions on the purchase of all firearms Ascholarly study found In the decade after 1957 the use of guns inserious crime increased a hundredfold100 In England as in the United States crime rates had been going downfor years before they suddenly reversed and rose during the second halfof the twentieth century101 as the social vision of the intelligentsiatriumphed in both countries not only as regards the welfare state butalso as regards a more lenient nonjudgmental attitude towardcriminals This was all part of a pattern of serious social retrogressions inboth countries A nonjudgmental society is a society where commondecency is optional and therefore not likely to remain as commonAnother parallel with the situation in the United States is thatlowincome children of immigrants in England outperformed lowincome nativeborn children educationally A study in Britain in2013 compared test results among children of various ethnic andnational backgrounds all of whom were from families with incomeslow enough to qualify for free lunches in school Children of African immigrants in this economic bracket met thetest standards nearly 60 percent of the time as did children ofimmigrants from Bangladesh living at the same economic levelChildren of black immigrants from the Caribbean at the sameeconomic level met the standards under 50 percent of the time Whitenativeborn children from families at the same economic level met thestandards 30 percent of the time In the borough of Knowsley such whitechildren scored lower than black children in any London borough102While these educational results in England may seem very differentfrom those in the United States in terms of the race of those doingbetter and those doing worse they are remarkably similar in terms ofchildren from a different foreign culture doing better in school thannativeborn children from a lowerclass culture whether in England orAmerica The usual explanations of substandard educationalperformances in black ghetto schools whether genetics racialdiscrimination or a legacy of slavery obviously do not apply tolowerclass whites in England But the outcomes are strikingly similarWhat lowerclass whites in England and ghetto blacks in theUnited States have in common is a legacy of a generationslongindoctrination in a welfare state ideology of victimhood grievancesand a vision of barriers stacked against them that make their prospectshopeless This welfare state ideology is backed up by welfare stateprograms that subsidize an economically counterproductive andsocially destructive lifestyle Meanwhile the children of lowincome immigrants not burdenedby the ideology that generations of the lowincome nativebornpopulation have been steeped in do far better in both countries InLife at the Bottom Dr Dalrymple said I cannot recall meeting asixteenyearold white from the public housing estates that are nearmy hospital who could multiply nine by seven I do not exaggerateEven three by seven often defeats them103 Genetic determinism canhardly explain abysmal educational results in children from a race thatPolitical Factors 165produced such mental giants as Shakespeare and Newton but whichnow turns out many youngsters unable to cope with simplearithmetic Nor is there a legacy of slavery or racial discriminationexcuse that would apply While the white students who do so badly in England are from thatcountrys lowerincome class poverty is not a sufficient explanationbecause such children represent a retrogression from previousgenerations of children from lowincome families104 just as in theUnited States Dr Dalrymples father was born in a slum But that wasin an earlier time when even a school in the slums maintainededucational standards and did not pander to the poor by nurturing asense of grievance and of unfair barriers blocking their rise as schoolshave in later times105 Instead schools of the earlier era sought to equipyoungsters with the human capital needed to rise out of poverty106Among the consequences of the welfare state in both England andAmerica is making it unnecessary for many people to develop theirown productive capacities their human capital when they can liveon what was produced by others The economic loss to society at largeis not simply the cost of welfare state benefits that are transferred tononproducing members of society but includes the perhaps largervalue of output that the recipients could produce if they had tosupport themselves In addition the counterproductive lifestyles developed insubsidized idleness in a nonjudgmental world impose serious psychiccosts on other members of society especially those financially unableto escape neighborhoods where the offensive and dangerous behaviorof those whom the welfare state and its accompanying social visionhave relieved from the norms of civilized behavior on both sides of theAtlantic This is in addition to the increased financial costs of prisons166 Wealth Poverty and Politics  When he died I found his school textbooks still among his possessions and theywere of a rigor and difficulty that would terrify a modern teacher let alone a childTheodore Dalrymple Life at the Bottom p 155 See also Peter Hitchens TheAbolition of Britain Chapter 3drug rehabilitation facilities foster care for neglected or abusedchildren and the like More than simple mistakes are involved in promoting a culture ofdependency among those whom government statisticians have chosento define as living in poverty A dependent voting constituency is veryvaluable to politicians and a paranoid constituency resentful ofsocial enemies supposedly dedicated to keeping them down is evenmore valuable to politicians who play the role of defenders of thedowntrodden in exchange for their votes The many welfare state programs to support low productivitypeople in their officially defined poverty serve the interests of welfarestate institutions as well as politicians American welfare statebureaucracies whose jobs budgets and power are advanced by theexistence of a large dependent population have not only createdadvertising campaigns to promote greater use of their programs theyhave also dispatched their employees to supermarkets in lowincomeneighborhoods to point out to people buying food that there aregovernment programs that will pay for their foodAlthough promoted as a means of helping people trapped bymisfortunes beyond their control welfare state institutions havethemselves become traps even for people who have in fact been victimsof unforeseen but transient misfortunes such as having a costly illnessor losing a job The multiplicity of uncoordinated welfare state benefitsavailable have in many American states added up to a total value farexceeding the official poverty level of income and exceeding what lowproductivity people could earn in the labor market107 After recoveryfrom an illness or other transient misfortunes after jobs becomeavailable again for example for many who have been absorbed intowelfare state dependency a return to the labor market could involve asignificant reduction in their standard of livingIf increasing ones earned income by 10000 would involve a loss ofeligibility for 15000 worth of governmentprovided benefits thatwould be in effect an implicit tax rate of more than 100 percent onearned income Even in less extreme cases welfare state beneficiariesPolitical Factors 167168 Wealth Poverty and Politicscan face an implicit tax rate on earned income that is higher than thatfacing millionaires if the welfare state beneficiaries were to return togainful employment at the cost of losing their eligibility for governmentbenefits Such disincentives have long been known and understood butneither politicians who benefit from welfare state dependency nor thepeople whose jobs are in the welfare state bureaucracies have anyincentive to correct what is a problem only for others these othersincluding both the welfare state beneficiaries and the taxpayersWe have seen how ethnic leaders in many countries have promotednotions beneficial to themselves but counterproductive for the groupsthey lead Perhaps it is significant that groups which have risen frompoverty to prosperity in various countries around the world have seldomhad as many or as prominent ethnic leaders as groups that remain at thebottom Any reasonably wellinformed American can name at leastthree or four black leaders of the past or present but would find it hardto name even a single comparable Asian or Jewish ethnic leader towhom these groups dramatic rises from poverty could be attributed The welfare state is also an often overlooked factor in the incomedisparities lamented by people who promote income redistribution ingeneral and the welfare state in particular In the United States mosthouseholds in the lowest 20 percent of income recipients have no oneworking108 Most of the economic resources transferred to them aretransferred in kind subsidized housing medical care and other suchbenefits rather than in money Therefore disparities expressed inmoney income statistics greatly exaggerate disparities in standards ofliving especially for people living in what the welfare state chooses todefine as poverty To the extent that the expanding welfare state allows more peopleto live without working and therefore without earning income ordeveloping their own human capital supporters of the welfare stateare contributing to the very income disparities they so much decryThe welfare state ideology so essential to creating and maintaining awelfare state can also have negative effects of its own on attitudes andbehavior as apparently that ideology has had in both England and theUnited States However this is not to say that all welfare states musthave the same effects in all countries or that the welfare state ideologymust be identical in all countries After all interactions matter here asin other contextsThe preexisting cultural values of different societies or ofdifferent groups within the same society can interact differently withthe same opportunities presented by the welfare state After all AsianAmericans live in the same welfare state as black Americans andHispanic Americans but have not succumbed to its temptations Itmay be no coincidence that the group that has longest been wards ofthe federal government American Indians living on reservationshave by a substantial amount the lowest per capita incomes The cultural context of the welfare state can differ among nationsas well as among groups within a given nation The fact that sons bornto families in the bottom 20 percent of income earners in SwedenNorway Finland and Denmark do not end up in the bottom 20percent as adults as often as happens in the United States109 mayreflect a different cultural context for the welfare state in theseScandinavian countries That is ultimately an empirical question Butthe situation at least serves as an illustration of the larger point that awelfare state like geographic cultural demographic and otherfactors does not operate in a vacuum but interacts with otherfactors We need not try to universalize the welfare state as it exists inthe United States just as we need not presume it to be uniqueA more deadly consequence of a pervasive sense of victimhoodgrievance and entitlement has been a lashing out at others Theinternational treatise Ethnic Groups in Conflict noted how commonsuch lashing out has been in countries around the world and thatbackward groups are overwhelmingly initiators and advanced groupsare targets of ethnic riot behavior110Ghetto riots that swept across the United States during the 1960sthe triumphant decade of the welfare state vision certainly fit thatpattern In later years there have been various repetitions of such riotsBut a new pattern has also emerged in more recent years organizedPolitical Factors 169black physical attacks on whites in such public places as shopping mallsparks and beaches usually places not located in ghettos Unlike ghetto riots that erupt as more or less spontaneousreactions to particular incidents even if later intensified byhoodlums who join in the mayhem and looting or career racialactivists who stir up mob emotions the new organized attacks onwhites are clearly preplanned and coordinated as large numbers ofyoung black males suddenly converge in locally overwhelmingnumbers to physically attack whites at random Often the atmosphere among the attackers is more festive thanangry111 even though serious and sometimes fatal injuries have beeninflicted One victim of such an attack said afterwards I heardlaughing as they were beating everybody up They were eating chipslike it was a picnic112 Nevertheless some among the intelligentsiacontinue to use the pat phrase troubled youths to describe exultantyoung hoodlumsSuch racial attacks have occurred in dozens of cities and smallercommunities in every region of the United States from coast tocoast113 There has been a pattern not only to these attacks but alsoto media and political responses The most common response mightbe summarized in one word denial Where the attacks have been too large too frequent or too widelyknown in a given community to be ignored the media response hasalmost invariably been to omit the racial aspect114 that was central tothe attackers themselves who often referred to their victims ascrackers or said such things as This is for Trayvon Martin Wheresuch attacks across the country over the years have been reported inthe media it has usually been as if each attack was an isolated localincident involving unspecified young people attacking unspecifiedvictims for unspecified reasonsWhere surveillance cameras reveal the racial makeup of theattackers and their victims mayors and police officials in communityafter community across the country have been quick to deny thatthese were racial attacks115 It is usually unnecessary for the media to170 Wealth Poverty and Politicsdeny that these attacks are occurring nationwide because few in themedia have ever connected the dots in the first place InvestorsBusiness Daily is one of the very few media outlets to call attention toa nationwide pattern of unprovoked and organized racial attacksAcross the US mobs of black youths are organizing on Facebook toloot stores and beat whites116 This same information was availableto others in the media but it seldom reached the publicOne variant of these blackonwhite attacks caught the mediasattention briefly the socalled knockout game in which anindividual attacker suddenly lets loose a hard punch to the head of anunsuspecting passerby in an attempt to knock him down and ifpossible out A series of such knockout punch attacks by blacksagainst Jews in the New York area seemed to catch everyone bysurprise in 2013117 even though a 2012 book about blackonwhiteviolence already had a chapter titled The Knockout Game St LouisStyle118 While it may be a game to the attackers the victims haveoften ended up in the hospital or dead Someone knocked out in aboxing ring lands on canvas someone knocked out on a city streetusually lands on concreteMany who deny or downplay such racial attacks may believe thatsuch denials or downplaying will avoid a white backlash that couldescalate into a truly disastrous race war But such attacks seem unlikelyto stop unless they get stopped That is unlikely to happen withoutwider and more honest recognition of the dangers followed by publicpressure on elected officials to do something more substantive andmore honest than denying that these attacks are racial Some people may imagine that one way of showing empathy withless fortunate people whether blacks in the United States or lowincome whites in England is to take a nonjudgmental attitudetoward their transgressions as if exempting any group from thestandards of civilized behavior is a net benefit to them or to society atlarge Barbarism is hardly a gift to any community Nor is an eventualviolent backlash against barbarism The history of intergroupbacklashes such as the Czech backlash against German civilians inPolitical Factors 171Czechoslovakia after World War II119 or the atrocities and counteratrocities between the Sinhalese and Tamils in Sri Lanka during thesecond half of the twentieth century120 is a history of horrors thatno one should want to see repeated on American soilLetting organized racial attacks continue across the country andperhaps escalate may only delay a larger and more violent racialbacklash and polarization as knowledge of such things spreadsdespite the mainstream media But in this as in many other thingspolitical incentives are to postpone the day of reckoning even if thatmeans that the reckoning will be larger and more catastrophicMoreover too many people have too much of a vested interestideologically if not materially or politically in the welfare statevision to have to admit even the possibility that the negativebehavioral consequences of the welfare state and its accompanyingnonjudgmental vision must be weighed against the material benefitsextended so widely and often so unthinkinglyMany Americans today may find it hard to imagine mobs ofwhites attacking blacks But it is not necessary to imagine This wasprecisely what a race riot meant in the United States a hundred yearsago especially in the first two decades of the twentieth century121The first major race riot initiated by blacks took place in Harlem in1935 Since the 1960s the blackinitiated riot has become the normBut things were different before and can become different again If sothe economic losses will be the least of the problems172 Wealth Poverty and PoliticsChapter 6IMPLICATIONS   ANDPROSPECTSYoure entitled to your own opinion butyoure not entitled to your own factsDaniel Patrick Moynihan1Questions about facts are obviously very different from questionsabout values goals or policies We can put particular competingexplanations of economic disparities to factual tests and perhapsequally important define our terms precisely enough so that we canat least know what we disagree about While differences of opinion onissues may be inevitable confusion on issues is notDIFFERENCES  IN  INCOMEAND  WEALTHWhat is the reason for differences in income and wealth amongindividuals races nations or civilizationsThe simplest answer is that there is no such thing as the reasonThere are all sorts of factors and many combinations andpermutations of those factors Nor have we enumerated them all andit is by no means certain that anyone could do so But what is clear173from the factors we have considered thus far is that the possibilitiesare too numerous to reasonably expect equal economic outcomeseither between nations or within nations when the things that go intocreating those outcomes vary so greatly The all too familiar clichabout the paradox of poverty in an affluent society is a paradox onlyto those who start with 1 a preconception of an egalitarian world indefiance of history and 2 a disregard of the arbitrary nature of thegovernmentdefined word povertyMuch of the egalitarian thrust of contemporary redistributionists isdirected toward the reduction or elimination of income or wealthdisparities or gaps between various groups But as distinguishedeconomic development economist Peter Bauer of the London Schoolof Economics pointed out The promotion of economic equality andthe alleviation of poverty are distinct and often conflicting2 Ifeveryones income doubles that should certainly reduce poverty but itwould also widen income gaps and disparities This applies to gaps anddisparities both between nations and within nations The welfare statecan reduce or perhaps even eliminate poverty in any material sensebut it also reduces the need for many people to earn incomeespecially when earning income reduces eligibility for governmentprovided benefits and therefore widens income gaps and disparitiesAs regards economic differences among nations all too often thequestion posed is much like that in a wellknown study Why NationsFail Why is Egypt so much poorer than the United States Whatare the constraints that keep Egyptians from becoming moreprosperous3 This implicitly treats what happens in the UnitedStates as a sort of norm as what happens usually or more or lessnaturally leaving the question as to why this usual normal or naturaldevelopment has been thwarted somehow in Egypt But Egypt ismuch more typical of what has happened around the world and overthe centuries than is the United States Given the many factors that go into the creation of wealth and thewide variety of combinations and permutations of those factors there isno more reason to expect those factors to come together in the same174 Wealth Poverty and Politicsway in Egypt as in the United States than there is to expect that all thefactors which come together to produce tornadoes would cometogether in Egypt as often as they come together in the United Statesmore so than in any other country or all other countries combined4To pursue the analogy with tornadoes there is nothing absolutelyunique that strikes the eye about either the geography or the climatein the United States that cannot be found as individual features inmany other places around the world Wide level plains are among thethings that facilitate the development of tornadoes but wide levelplains exist across much of Europe and in Argentina and Indiaamong other places What is unique about the United States is thecombination of things that occur together in the middle of thecountry rather than on the coasts in particular seasons of the year andin the afternoons more so than in the mornings or at night thatcause the vast majority of all the tornadoes in the world to occur inthe United StatesWe would not set out to discover why there are not more tornadoesin Egypt if we were interested in knowing how tornadoes originateand behave Similarly there is not much reason to seek the causes ofpoverty in Egypt or in any other country Poverty genuinepoverty has been the lot of most of the human race for most of theexistence of the species However a more reasonable question alsoappears in Why Nations Fail Was it historically or geographicallyor culturally or ethnically predetermined that Western Europe theUnited States and Japan would become so much richer than subSaharan Africa Latin America and China over the last two hundredyears or so5While nothing predestined particular nations or peoples to bemore prosperous than others many things facilitated or impeded theeconomic development of some nations and peoples more thanothers It is hard to think of any fundamental development thatadvanced the human race coming out of isolated mountaincommunities isolated islands or other places where geographyimpeded access to other peoples Australia being for millennia theImplications and Prospects 175classic example of a continent isolated from other continents withAustralian aborigines being regarded as classic lagging peoples It may suggest something about human beings in general that nogiven individuals or even small societies have been capable of reachingthe heights of human achievements without access to the current andprevious achievements of vastly larger numbers of other people Theinvention of the rangefinder used on naval ships and at one time onmany cameras drew upon mathematical principles developed in Greecemore than two thousand years ago as the Pythagorean Theorem Without access to thoughts recorded in ancient times and otherinformation developed at other places and other times since then todevelop a rangefinder from scratch would be a far more formidabletask For more complex inventions the task would be virtuallyimpossible Would an illiterate Einstein growing up in a primitivetribe on an isolated island in the middle of the Pacific Ocean haveproduced a theory of relativity Even far less earthshaking advanceshave built on the work of innumerable predecessors scattered in manycountries over many centuries going all the way back to those whoinvented numbers and letters To ask why nations fail is to treat our conception of success as anorm rather than the rare exception that it is in the long history ofhuman beings It may be an understandable human tendency for us toregard whatever we happen to be used to immediately around us asusual or natural But that does not make it so In preCivil WarAmerica slavery was referred to as a peculiar institution becauseslavery was so inconsistent with the principles and practices in the restof American society But the tragic fact is that slavery was a pervasiveinstitution among innumerable peoples around the world forthousands of years It is freedom for ordinary people that has been apeculiar institution of relatively recent vintage as history ismeasured and still in jeopardy in many countries even today aswell as being utterly suppressed in some other countriesThe real challenge in discussing wealth poverty and politics is totry to understand what peculiar combination of circumstances has176 Wealth Poverty and Politicsresulted in the level of prosperity found in such places as Japan andWestern Europe and in such offshoot nations of Western Europe asthe United States or Australia Nor have these particularcombinations and permutations of factors been present from timeimmemorial even in these particular countries In ancient timesentirely different countries were on the frontiers of human economicand other advances Poverty occurs automatically It is wealth that must be producedand must be explained That is why the approach here has been toexamine such factors as geography culture demography and politicsas influences on production Income is a byproduct of thatproduction This may all seem obvious but its implications areapparently not obvious to many who wish to treat incomedistribution as a discrete issue with virtually a life of its own whileproduction fades into the dim background as if the patterns ofincomes can be changed to suit our desires without any repercussionson production on which the standard of living of society as a wholedepends The attempt to treat poverty as a discrete problem onethat can be solved by an expansion of the welfare state as in theAmerican war on poverty launched in the 1960s has had socialrepercussions that should be very sobering Because the most fundamental statistics on what is called incomedistribution are so widely misunderstood we need to begin byclarifying what these data do and do not mean After that we can turnto a closer examination of some of the factors behind the differencesin incomes that exist within nations and between nationsIncome StatisticsThere are two fundamentally different kinds of statistics used toshow income trends over time and these different kinds of statisticsproduce diametrically opposite conclusions The people who appear in one kind of income statistics are a set ofthe same identical individuals whose incomes are tabulatedImplications and Prospects 177throughout the years covered by a given study A very different kindof statistics and the kind most often cited in the media in politicsand in academia is based on tabulating the incomes of whatevermix of people happen to be in such categories as the top fifth thebottom fifth and other brackets in between in any given year A seriesof such tabulations in a series of years then serves as the basis forconclusions about the incomes earned in each of the various brackets These latter kinds of statistics are often cited to assert that incomesof people in the top bracket the rich are increasing relative to theincomes of people in the bottom bracket the poor or relative toincomes of people in other brackets in between Assertions that thegap between rich and poor has widened in America have appeared inthe New York Times6 and in innumerable other media outletsincluding the Washington Post where columnist EJ Dionnedescribed the wealthy as people who have made almost all theincome gains in recent years and added that they are undertaxed7Books like The Fair Society by Peter Corning of Stanford Universityrepeat the same theme that the income gap between the richest andthe poorest members of our society has been growing rapidly8Although such statements which abound throughout the media andare echoed in politics and in academia are phrased as if they arecomparing the incomes of specific sets of people over time the richand the poor they are in fact comparing the incomes of particularincome brackets containing an everchanging mix of people over time asindividuals move massively from one bracket to another in the normalcourse of their careers going from entrylevel jobs to jobs that pay farmore to successively more experienced people Those who go intobusiness or the professions likewise tend to acquire a larger clientelewith the passing years resulting in rising incomes there as wellStudies which actually follow a given set of individuals over timereach not only different conclusions but opposite conclusions fromstudies which follow income brackets containing everchanging mixes ofpeople at very different stages of their individual careers A study at theUniversity of Michigan that followed specific individuals working178 Wealth Poverty and PoliticsAmericans from 1975 to 1991 found that those particular individualswho were initially in the bottom 20 percent in income had their realincomes rise over the years not only at a higher rate but in a several timeslarger total amount than the real incomes of those particular individualswhose incomes were initially in the top 20 percent9As a result of their rising incomes 95 percent of those people whowere initially in the bottom quintile in 1975 were no longer there in1991 Twentynine percent of the people who were initially in thebottom quintile rose all the way to the top quintile while just 5percent remained behind in the bottom quintile where they beganMeanwhile over that same span of time those people who wereinitially in the top quintile in 1975 had the smallest increase in realincome by 1991 smallest in both percentage terms and in absoluteamount of people in any of the quintiles The amount by which theaverage income of people initially in the top quintile rose was lessthan half that in any of the other quintiles10However radically different this empirical pattern is from themany loudly proclaimed assertions that the rich have been gettingricher and the poor getting poorer over time there is nothingsurprising about the mundane fact that people who start out at thebottom in entrylevel jobs usually rise over the years to successivelyhigher levels of work and pay Meanwhile those who have alreadyreached middle age where their productivity and earnings are highestare unlikely to see any comparably large further increases inproductivity and pay as time goes on A later study using data from the Internal Revenue Service founda very similar pattern This study followed those specific individualswho filed income tax returns over the course of a decade from 1996through 2005 Those whose incomes were initially in the bottom 20percent of this group saw their incomes rise by 91 percent during thatdecade that is their incomes nearly doubled Those whose incomeswere initially in the muchdiscussed top one percent saw theirincomes actually fall by 26 percent during that same decade11 Againthe facts are the opposite of the loudly proclaimed assertions basedImplications and Prospects 179on statistics that measure what is happening over time to abstractcategories income brackets with changing mixes of people whichare then discussed as if they were statistics about what was happeningover time to a given set of fleshandblood human beingsA more recent study that followed specific individuals over time inCanada from 1990 through 2009 found patterns very similar to thepatterns found in studies of Americans Those Canadians who wereinitially in the bottom 20 percent in income had their incomesincrease at both a higher rate and in a higher absolute amount thanthose whose incomes were initially in higher brackets12 Yet againwhat happened over time to a given set of human beings was theopposite of what happened over that same span of time in abstractcategories with changing mixes of people In Canada as in the UnitedStates the upper brackets incomes were rising faster than the lowerbrackets incomes and as in the United States this was spoken ofas if it represented what was happening to given sets of people13Unfortunately statistical surveys that follow specific individualsover the years are more expensive than statistical surveys that simplycompile data over the years in abstract categories containing everchanging mixtures of people at highly varying stages of their ownindividual life cycles So it is not surprising that the US Bureau of theCensus and numerous other collectors of statistics turn out far moredata on what is happening to abstract categories over time than dataon what is happening to specific sets of people over timeNevertheless what happens in those abstract categories incomebrackets over time is then discussed just as if that is what ishappening to specific sets of people over time often called the poorand the rich Transients in the various income brackets are spokenof as if they were continuous residents in those bracketsUnderstandable and commendable as it may be to be concernedabout the fate of fellow human beings that is very different from beingobsessed with the fate of numbers in abstract categories To say asProfessor Thomas Piketty does in his much acclaimed book Capital inthe TwentyFirst Century that the upper decile is truly a world unto180 Wealth Poverty and Politicsitself 14 is to fly in the face of the fact that most American households56 percent are in the top decile at some point in their lives15 usuallyin their older years For most Americans to envy or resent the top tenpercent would be to envy or resent themselves This is not even classwarfare but confusion between social classes and age cohorts Statistics on income differences are almost universally andautomatically discussed as if these must be differences between socialclasses rather than differences among people of different agesIndeed there is seldom even a mention of the possibility that thesenumbers can refer to either social classes or age cohorts much lessattempts in the popular media to determine to what extent they referto people of different ages rather than people in different socialclasses  The income and wealth statistics that are paraded with suchfervor can be perfectly accurate and yet completely misleadingIf infants have less income or wealth than their parents who inturn have less income or wealth than their grandparents that is hardlythe same as if individuals are in wealth or poverty over the course oftheir lives Yet the latter is a common insinuation garnished withnumbers As statistics infants can be the same as grandparents butonly as statistics Even if the data are limited to adults younger adultsare the same as older adults only as statistics and economicdisparities between people of different ages are not the same aseconomic disparities between classesEven the vaunted top one percent so often discussed in themedia is a level reached by 12 percent of Americans at some point intheir lives16 What Professor Paul Krugman refers to as the charmedcircle of the 1 percent17 must have a somewhat fleeting charmbecause most of the people in that circle in 1996 were no longer therein 200518 In Professor Pikettys vision the top one percent in incomeImplications and Prospects 181  Young adults can take years to raise their net wealth to zero since people in theseage brackets are often in debt for college loans automobiles home furnishingsand these debts often exceed their savings Meanwhile people in their 60s have longsince passed that point and have had decades in which to accumulate savingsequity in a home andor to have put money in a pension plan These age disparitiesin wealth can be large without necessarily being class disparitiesnot only live in their own separate world but stand out in society andexert a significant influence on both the social landscape and thepolitical and economic order19 according to Piketty who says thatthey are atop the hierarchy and structure of inequality20 he projectsThere is however a fundamental difference between a structureand a process Piketty glosses over the process in which peoplesincomes change substantially over the course of their lives or evenin the course of just one decade More than half of all taxpayersmoved to a different income quintile between 1996 and 2005 and thesame was true in the preceding decade21 Among people in themiddle quintile for example 42 percent moved up to a higher incomequintile while 25 percent dropped to a lower quintile and only 33percent remained in the middle quintile22Turnover is especially pronounced among those with the highestincomes While less than half the people in the top one percent werestill there at the end of a decade only about onequarter of those inthe top onehundredth of one percent in 1996 were still there in200523 More than half saw their incomes cut in half or more duringthat decade24 The turnover is even faster among those taxpayers withthe 400 highest incomes in the country incomes far higher thanamong the top one percent as a whole Fewer than onefourth of theincome tax filers with the top 400 incomes in 1992 were in that samebracket more than once during the years ending in 2000 and only13 percent were in that extremely high bracket more than twiceduring those nine years25 At very high income levels whether thetop one percent onehundredth of one percent or the top 400incomes that income is far more likely to come from investmentswhich are far more volatile than salariesIn short even more than most people in other income bracketsmost of the people among the top 400 income recipients aretransients in this case mostly people with a spike in income for justone year out of nine Whether their one year at this level is due toreceiving an inheritance or otherwise cashing in assets accumulatedover the previous years or is due to some other reason the people who182 Wealth Poverty and Politicsare fleeting residents in this income bracket are hardly crediblecandidates for the powerful andor sinister roles assigned to them inmuch ideological and political rhetoric This is not to say that there areno enduringly wealthy people who in fact have lives and lifestyles farremoved from those in the rest of society The question is whether theyare the same people as those who happen to be in particular incomebrackets at particular times Otherwise what is the point of citing thosestatistics based on everchanging mixes of people and talking aboutthem as if they were data on a given set of human beings over time  Pikettys crucial misstep is verbally converting a fluid process overtime into a rigid structure with a more or less permanent top onepercent living isolated from the rest of society that is supposedlysubjected to their control or influence It is a vision divorced fromdemonstrable facts however consonant it may be with prevailingpreconceptions  Much has been made of Pikettys voluminous statistics from variouscountries But as JA Schumpeter said long ago You can travel farand wide and yet wear blinkers wherever you go26 Testing theaccuracy of Pikettys vast array of statistics would be a monumentaltask and a task perhaps not worth the time and effort since the realquestion is not about the accuracy of the numbers themselves butabout the accompanying misstatement of what the numbers aremeasuring However it may be worth noting in passing that Pikettysrepeated statements that the top income tax bracket under PresidentHerbert Hoover was taxed at 25 percent are contradicted by an officialInternal Revenue Service document showing that the top income taxbracket in 1932 was taxed at 63 percent27Another source of confusion in discussions of peoples economicdifferences is a failure to distinguish income from wealth Income andwealth are too fundamentally different from each other to makeconfident inferences about one from statistics about the other Use ofthe term the rich to describe people in higher income brackets is justone sign of the confusion between income and wealth since beingrich means having an accumulation of wealth rather than simply aImplications and Prospects 183high income in a given year This is not just a matter of semantics Ata practical level raising income tax rates to make the rich pay theirundefined fair share is an exercise in futility since income taxes do nottouch wealth It is a tax on people who may be trying to accumulatewealth but people who already have accumulations of wealth eitherpersonally earned or from inheritance are exempt Praise for billionaires who say that they are in favor of higherincome tax rates is completely misplaced when those higher tax rateswill not touch their billions even if such tax rate increases are aserious burden to other people who are trying to get ahead andaccumulate something to leave for their families after they are goneImplicit in much discussion of income distribution statistics isthe notion that certain income brackets receive not only a highershare of total income but do so at the expense of lower incomebrackets That is the poor are made poorer by the rich whobecome richer according to this view Some such as Washington Postcolumnist Eugene Robinson have made this claim explicit as whenhe said The rich are getting richer at the expense not only of thepoor but of the middle class as well These nonrich are referred toas longsuffering victims of the upper crust who have beenwaging an undeclared but devastating war against them28Mr Robinson has however inadvertently performed a real serviceby bringing to the surface a widespread undercurrent of confusionthat cannot withstand scrutiny in the light of day We can put asidefor the moment his implicit assumption that trends in statistics aboutincome brackets with their everchanging mixes of people are thesame as trends about what is happening to given sets of fleshandblood human beings called the rich and the poor We may for thesake of argument leave that particular confusion aside in order tofocus attention on the rest of his argumentEven during periods when a higher share of total income goes tothe top income bracket that does not prevent the real income receivedin the bottom bracket from rising absolutely During the period from1985 through 2001 for example the income share of the bottom 20184 Wealth Poverty and Politicspercent of American households declined from 4 percent of allincomes to 35 percent of all incomes but the average real income ofhouseholds in the bottom 20 percent rose by thousands of dollars29This is not even taking into account the welldocumented fact thatmost people initially in the bottom income quintile move up and outof that quintile over a span of years as long as that in this example Buteven if they had all stayed put the rising amount and share of incomeof the rich would still not have made them poorer as the data show The rising absolute real income in the bottom quintile happenedover the years while the number of billionaires has been growingand according to people like Eugene Robinson prospering at theexpense of the poor against whom the rich were waging warHowever since most households in the bottom 20 percent in incomehave no one working30 it is not clear what the rich can be takingfrom those who are producing nothingThe Randomness AssumptionWith very few of the things that go into creating economicproduction being equally available to all either among nations orwithin nations it is hard to understand how the expectation ofequality in economic outcomes has acquired such a hold oncontemporary thinking that income inequalities disparitiesgaps or inequities are taken as being at least strange if notsinister But gross inequalities in outcomes are rampant in all kinds ofhuman endeavors around the world whether economic orotherwise including those that can hardly be explained bydiscrimination exploitation or the many other sins of human beingsThose sins are real but their moral significance does not automaticallymake them causal factors of the same significance in economicoutcomes That is an important empirical question though oneseldom addressed by moral crusaders Because the implicit assumption that even or random outcomes arenatural is so widespread and so consequential in its moral politicalImplications and Prospects 185and even legal implications it is an assumption that needs to beexamined at some length and confronted with many facts about manydifferent kinds of human endeavors As we have seen in earlierchapters geographic demographic and cultural factors are oftengrossly unequal Moreover people do not behave randomly butpurposefully They do not for example immigrate randomly either interms of the locations they come from in the country they leave or thelocations where they settle in the countries they go to They do notraise their children the same as shown by the large differences in thenumber of words people at different socioeconomic levels speak totheir children Purposeful human activities are seldom random in themselves or intheir consequences Nor are they the same among different groupswhether different by race sex religion birth order or innumerableother variablesDifferences in achievements are drastic not only in economicendeavors but in all sorts of other endeavors from the most mundaneto the most exalted An international study of widely recognizedEuropean historic figures in the arts and sciences from the beginningof the fifteenth century through the middle of the twentieth centuryfound their geographic origins highly concentrated in particularplaces Thus 80 percent of all the European significant figures can beenclosed in an area that does not include Russia Sweden NorwayFinland Spain Portugal the Balkans Poland Hungary East andWest Prussia Ireland Wales most of Scotland the lower quarter ofItaly and about a third of France31In the United States the same study found that about half of thesignificant American individuals in the arts and sciences from thetime of the founding of the republic to the middle of the twentiethcentury were concentrated in an arc extending from Portland Maineto the southern tip of New Jersey The New England states plus NewYork Pennsylvania and New Jersey produced more than seven timesthe number of significant American figures in the arts and sciences asdid the states that had formed the Confederacy during the Civil War186 Wealth Poverty and PoliticsMost of those Southern states had none at all with Virginia being anotable exception32Similar extreme disparities have been found in individualaccomplishments in sports Among professional golfers who hadsurvived to the final two rounds of a Professional Golfers AssociationPGA tournament there was a rough approximation of a normal bellcurve when it came to such individual aspects of golf as the averagenumber of putts per round of play or driving distances off the tee33But there was a radically skewed distribution of results when it cameto the ultimate test of the combinations of the various golf skillsnamely winning PGA tournaments Even among the above average group of professional golfers whohad survived to the final two rounds of a PGA tournament 53percent never won a single PGA tournament in their entire careersAmong the 47 percent who did win a PGA tournament almost allwon just one two or three34 But Arnold Palmer Jack Nicklaus andTiger Woods each won dozens of PGA tournaments and more than200 among the three of them35There have been similarly very skewed distributions amongwinners of Grand Slam titles in tennis batting championships inbaseball and winners of points in world chess championships36 Ofthe 100 topranked marathon runners in the world in 2012 68 wereKenyans37 When two American boys whose ancestors came fromIndia tied for first place in the US National Spelling Bee in 2014 itwas the seventh consecutive year in which the Spelling Bee was wonby an Indian American Indian Americans had also won twelve of theprevious sixteen38 During the twentieth century there were eighttimes when a major league baseball player stole 100 bases or more Alleight times that player was black39The same skewed distribution is found among recipients ofacademic degrees As of the early twentyfirst century every justice ofthe US Supreme Court had a degree from one of the eight Ivy Leagueinstitutions in the northeast out of the thousands of American collegesand universities across the country Among people who earned aImplications and Prospects 187Bachelors degree in the United States in academic year 20112012nearly fourfifths of those with degrees in education were women andnearly fourfifths of those with degrees in engineering were men40Although blacks greatly outnumber Asians in the Americanpopulation and slightly outnumber them among recipients ofBachelors degrees Asians received more than twice as manyBachelors degrees in engineering as blacks41 The disparity is evengreater at the top engineering schools where Asians haveoutnumbered blacks by threetoone at MIT tentoone at HarveyMudd College and by fortytoone at Cal Tech42 But even theextreme disparity at Cal Tech was not as great as the disparitybetween Chinese and Malays earning engineering degrees inMalaysia during the 1960s During that decade students from theChinese minority earned just over a hundred times as manyengineering degrees as students from the Malay majority43 in acountry where the Malays control both the universities and thegovernment that sets university policiesExamples of such gross disparities in innumerable humanendeavors could be extended almost indefinitely just counting thosewhere the circumstances virtually preclude discrimination such asmen being struck by lightning several times as often as women ordominant majorities being outperformed by subordinate minorities44Despite these and many other examples of outcomes in manydifferent kinds of human endeavors that are remote from an even orrandom distribution in situations where discrimination can be ruledout the implicit assumption persists that uneven or nonrandomoutcomes are strange and suspicious Moreover these are not just casualopinions They are conclusions that have carried great weight in courtsof law in cases involving disparate impact statistics which showdemographic underrepresentation of particular groups that are verydifferent from what would be expected by random chance Among theintelligentsia in the media or even in academia such statistics are oftentreated as virtually ironclad proof of discrimination The implicitassumption of randomness thus trumps innumerable contrary facts188 Wealth Poverty and Politicsshowing grossly uneven and nonrandom outcomes from all sorts ofpurposeful human endeavors Moreover serious laws and policies arebased on these assumptions in defiance of factsRedistributionists seldom if ever offer a principled criterion bywhich current inequalities might be judged Few today are prepared tosay that there should be absolute equality of income or wealth butthey seldom offer more than ad hoc pronouncements that currentinequalities are too much Perhaps the closest they come to some principle is that currentinequalities are greater than the inequalities in some other time orplace But this offers no principle on which to choose a particular timeor place to serve as a standard for judging other times and placesMoreover the ignored production processes change over timemaking different mixes of skills and talents more in demand thanbefore and others less in demand than before requiring differentpatterns of pay as incentives to attract people with the currently morevalued qualificationsAn obvious example of such changes has been the reduced value ofphysical labor as machine power has in many cases replaced humanmuscle thereby making the male workers advantage in physicalstrength less relevant reducing the pay gap between the sexes evenbefore there were equal pay laws To say that pay differences between people at the top and peopleat the bottom have increased over the years means something verydifferent when these are differences between classes than when theseare differences between people in different age brackets Only 13percent of American households headed by someone 25 years oldhave been in the top 20 percent of household incomes while 73percent of households headed by someone 60 years old have been45Since every 60yearold was once a 25yearold increased incomedifferences between age brackets are hardly an injustice to Americanswho live out a normal lifespan Increased income differences between those at the top and those atthe bottom may in other situations reflect a greater demand forImplications and Prospects 189particular skills relative to unskilled and inexperienced labor or agreater demand for financial expertise relative to personneldepartment experience for example Increased income disparities mayalso reflect the fact that an increasing proportion of the populationcan live without working or with only sporadic or parttime workthanks to the many benefits available from the welfare state Thesebenefits are not counted in income statistics even though the value ofthese inkind benefits ranging from subsidized housing to medicalcare greatly exceeds the recorded money income of people in thebottom 20 percent of income recipients46In short income statistics greatly overstate differences in standardsof living between income brackets because income data are reportedbefore taxes and before massive transfers of inkind benefitsespecially to those in the bottom income brackets Not all differences in income are due to age or welfare of coursebut whatever these differences are due to the changing requirementsof the production process imply that there is no reason why aparticular pattern of income or wealth differences from a particulartime or place should remain unchanged or serve as a benchmark forpeople living in other times and placesEven less is there any reason why intellectuals or politicians shouldacquire increased control over the lives of millions of fellow humanbeings as each imperfection of life is discovered or claimed Not sincethe era of the divine right of kings has there been such an implicitassumption that some people are entitled to take away the right ofother people to make their own decisions about their own lives Oftensuch powers are claimed on the basis of what is called social justiceSocial JusticePerhaps the bestknown contemporary exposition of moralprinciples relevant to differences in income and wealth has been thatin John Rawls influential treatise A Theory of Justice Professor Rawlsconception of social justice in the economy is that those who are at190 Wealth Poverty and Politicsthe same level of talent and ability and have the same willingness touse them should have the same prospects of success regardless oftheir initial place in the social system that is irrespective of theincome class into which they are born47Perhaps few Americans would object to this ideal even if they mightdisagree as to how or whether it can be put into practice However thatideal is almost immediately modified by Rawls with the proviso thatthe advantages of persons with greater natural endowments are to belimited to those that further the good of the poorer sectors of society48That is because Justice is prior to efficiency according to Rawls49 anddifferences in natural ability are as undeserved and therefore as unjustas being born an heir to a fortuneTo say as Rawls does that unjust rewards may be tolerated only tothe extent necessary to benefit people in the poorer sectors ofsociety raises both factual and moral issues As we have seen thepoorer sectors of society as defined by income are a transient groupdisproportionately of the younger and less experienced and no oneremains younger for life Among that small proportion 5 percentof those in the bottom income quintile who remain there over theyears as most others move on up it cannot be arbitrarily assumed thatthis unusual fate can have nothing to do with the way they havechosen to live their livesTo say as Rawls does that morally nothing should be done tobenefit the rest of society if it does not also help those at the bottom50can amount to enshrining a veto on progress on behalf of those witha counterproductive lifestyle Many conclusions that might makesense in a world of predestination do not make sense in a world ofindividual choices That such choices may be influenced by past socialconditions does not mean that they cannot also be influenced bycurrent rewards or penalties for current conduct including nonjudgmental subsidies of counterproductive behaviorOur survey of peoples and places around the world in earlierchapters in search of reasons for disparities in income and wealthwhether between nations or within nations has been implicitly aImplications and Prospects 191search for reasons behind differences in productivity Others who aremore interested in redistributing incomes and wealth often leave theproduction of these incomes and this wealth in the dim backgroundBy pushing the production process off into the backgroundredistributionists avoid confronting the question whether incomeinequalities might be matched by corresponding inequalities ineconomic productivity What redistributionists seek to suggest or to proclaim is theinjustice of existing rewards given that so much of what a givenindividual receives originated in some windfall gain or windfall lossof which the accident of birth is central In short redistributionistsseek to judge merit more so than productivity or even in somecases to the exclusion of productivity given the Rawlsian principlethat justice is more important than economic efficiencyWe can use the criteria of social justice advocates for the sake ofargument Imagine a man who was born to parents who were notmerely poor but alcoholic irresponsible and neglectful or abusivetoward their children For such an individual born in such a family tosomehow have wrenched himself away from the culture of such anenvironment and become a very decent and hardworking manacquiring a skill such as carpentry to support himself and his familywhom he treats far better than he was treated as a child wouldcertainly be a meritorious achievementImagine now a different man born in very different circumstancesto loving and caring parents raised in an affluent or wealthy homewith all the advantages that social position can confer in terms ofprivate education and wider cultural exposure For such a man to goon to become a brain surgeon would certainly be commendable butby no means necessarily more of a meritorious achievement than thatof the carpenterIn a world where rewards were based solely on merit there wouldbe no obvious reason to pay the brain surgeon any more than thecarpenter was paid But in a world where productivity matters this isno longer a question of the relative merits of individuals What is far192 Wealth Poverty and Politicsmore important than meritbased social justice to particular incomerecipients is the wellbeing of all the people who stand to benefit fromwhat they produce Introducing production into the discussion makesa big difference It is now a question of the relative urgency of brainsurgery and carpentry and of providing incentives for young people ofhigh ability however acquired to choose the long and challengingpreparation to become brain surgeons out of the many options theyhave however unjust it may be that some people have so many moreoptions than others haveInstead of limiting ourselves to weighing the relative economicfates of particular individuals or groups as income recipients adiscussion of the goods and services produced by those individuals orgroups weighs as well the fate of those other members of society whobenefit from the goods and services produced by those who are thesole or primary focus of income redistributionists To call the fate of consumers of goods and services a matter ofefficiency while calling the fate of those who receive incomes forproducing those goods and services a matter of social justice andthen making social justice categorically more important thanefficiency as Rawls does51 is to make a distinction without adifference If income is redistributed in a way that reduces efficiencywhich is what makes the distinction relevant then the economiclosses of some as consumers are simply arbitrarily declared to be lessimportant than the economic gains of others from social justice Butwhat is an injustice if not an undeserved cost of some sort inflictedon people It is hard to see how an undeserved cost inflicted on peoplein their role of consumers is morally different from an undeserved costinflicted on people in their role of income recipients SolutionsThe question must be raised as to the basis for arming intellectualcoteries with the massive powers of government to forcibly undoeconomic transactions terms made by millions of people intimatelyImplications and Prospects 193194 Wealth Poverty and Politicsfamiliar with their own individual circumstances and alternatives in away that distant intellectuals or government functionaries cannotpossibly be familiar Moreover what if those millions of people do notshare Rawls notion that justice is more important than efficiencyIndeed if any two things each have some value one cannot becategorically more valuable than the other as Rawls claims52 Adiamond may be worth much more than a penny but enough pennieswill be worth more than any diamond Comfortable academics on ivycovered campuses may be able toafford a preoccupation with statistical patterns and a preference forincome numbers that fit their preconceptions But that is verydifferent from saying that people mired in poverty genuine povertyperhaps in the Third World are wrong to welcome some billionaireinvestor who wants to set up a factory near them that will provide jobsenabling them to give their families things they have never been ableto afford before just because that billionaires investment will alsomake him richer than before to the discomfort of those readingstatistics on distant campuses or in distant editorial officesThose among the intelligentsia and other social justice advocatesmay prefer a statistically more equal society to a more prosperoussociety even one that is better able to subsidize the poor But whilethat is the right of those who hold such views it is also the right ofothers including lowincome people to prefer a more prosperoussociety If the aversion of the intelligentsia to the level of inequality inthe United States were shared by the poor in other countries it wouldbe hard to account for the longstanding massive and sometimesdesperate efforts of poor immigrants from around the world to reachAmericaThe very idea that millions of fellow human beings must be forcedto arrange themselves in a tableau pleasing to a relative handful ofintellectuals or politicians is not only grotesque in itself but still more  Multinational corporations typically pay higher wages than local employers in theThird Worldamazing as part of a claim of higher morality equality orhumanitarianism under the name of social justice Nor does theactual track record of intellectuals in many other aspects of life inspireconfidence in either their assumptions or their conclusions One of the reasons for paying people for their productivity ratherthan their merits is that productivity is far easier to determine thanmerit This is especially so in a market economy where the value ofwhat is produced is judged by whoever chooses to buy it and use itFew can have anything approaching a comparable knowledge orunderstanding of someone elses merit especially when they have notwalked in his shoes This of course does not mean that nothing whatever should bedone to widen the options of those born into less fortunatecircumstances and who consequently have had fewer options fordeveloping their productivity Indeed there has never been a time inthe entire history of the United States when nothing whatever wasbeing done for such people American society is one where majorvoluntary philanthropy has been going on for centuries The UnitedStates has been and is unique in the extent to which privatephilanthropy has created schools libraries scholarships collegesfoundations hospitals and other civic institutions that are elsewhereprovided by government or

general Southern culture in whicheducation was by no means a high priority WEB Du Bois called thework of these white volunteers from the North the finest thing inAmerican history53Much of such philanthropic activity as this is ignored by those wholargely ignore productivity in general whether economically orsocially motivated productivity But such voluntary civicmindedactivities cannot be taken as given natural or something that justhappens somehow It differs as greatly as the economic productionthat is so often also treated as something that just happens somehowin disregard of how very differently it happens in different places andtimes with correspondingly different effects on peoples standards ofliving But such civicminded activities do not occur equally in allsocieties around the world or even to the same extent throughoutWestern civilization Nineteenth century French visitor Alexis de Tocqueville was struckby the extent of voluntary civic activities among Americans as hereported in his classic Democracy in America54 But distinguishedAmerican scholar Edward C Banfield found no such widespreadattitudes or practices in the Italian mountain village where he stayedin

a white Southern scholar observedin the early twentieth century no race has come further againstgreater handicaps A race peremptorily shorn of its cultural heritagebecame in three generations a group

nationbuilding by outsiders whetherforeign governments or various experts supplied by internationalagencies such as the World Bank or the International Monetary FundDespite the many attempts to blame the poverty of some nations onexploitation by other nations or by foreign investors it would be hard tofind nations that rose from poverty to prosperity by ridding themselvesof colonial overlords however desirable that might be on othergrounds or by confiscating the property of foreign investors Indeedimpressive lists of the failures or even counterproductive consequencesof such approaches can be and have been compiled60Still less often can nations be found that rose from poverty toprosperity by expelling or by driving out through oppression or mobviolence various minorities widely described as exploiters orparasites such as the Jews in Eastern Europe the Chettiars inBurma the Asians in East Africa or others in various other parts ofthe world and in different periods of history Often the nations that drove out such groups were worse offeconomically after they were gone and the nations that welcomedthem were better off The United States has benefitted from thearrival of millions of Jews from Europe who not only provideddisproportionate numbers of people in many professions but alsoincluded world class scientists who were disproportionatelyrepresented among those who created the first nuclear bomb onwhich Americas international position as a superpower rested The descendants of great conquering nations and peoples oftenhave little to show economically from the historic feats of theirancestors whether the hordes of Genghis Khan the Spanishconquistadors the Ottoman Turks or others Some conquests have200 Wealth Poverty and Politicsleft behind prosperous progeny among the descendants of theconquerors but these were usually conquests by nations that werealready prosperous such as the British who conquered and settledAustralia and most of North America displacing the indigenouspopulations in both places The even larger conquests of Spain in theWestern Hemisphere usually led to nations in Latin America thathave seldom been as prosperous as the former British colonies inNorth America or Australia even when the Latin American countrieshave had fertile soil and rich natural resourcesIf there is any common thread in these widely varying outcomes itseems to be human capital This can be seen by comparisons ofnations and by comparisons of groups within given nations Argentina for example has been described as among the worldsmost richly endowed countries with extraordinarily fertile land inwhich the roots of some plants go down 15 feet in soil unencumberedby rocks61 Unlike some other Latin American countries Argentinaspopulation is

values attached towork education and entrepreneurship among other cultural factorsthat the British promoted and the Spaniards disdained Culturaldifferences among groups within Argentina reinforce the

laborers andhave been credited with contributing to the vast expansion ofagriculture in nineteenth century Argentina64 In addition to theseagricultural laborers who were called golondrinas or swallows becausethey came and went with the seasons there were other Italian farmworkers who remained as permanent residents These latter Italiansoften began as peons and then saved over the years until they couldbecome sharecroppers and then eventually landowners65Despite the unusual fertility of Argentine land the countryimported wheat until foreign farmers notably Italians but alsoincluding Germans from Russia among others arrived andtransformed Argentina into one of the worlds great wheatexportingnations66 But the fact that the land was always capable of growingwheat meant nothing before Argentina acquired people who wereprepared to do what was required to be successful wheat farmers Yetagain geography is not predestinationIn the cities as in the farmlands Argentines were outperformed byimmigrants As of 1914 foreigners who were about 30 percent ofthe Argentine population owned 72 percent of the commercialbusinesses in Argentina and 82 percent in Buenos Aires67 Italianentrepreneurs in Buenos Aires predominated in the production ofalcoholic beverages except beer where the Germans were preeminent68Argentines were not noted for saving and were in fact called thespendthrift of the world69 In 1887 the Banco de la Provincia de202 Wealth Poverty and PoliticsBuenos Aires had twice as many depositors who were citizens of Italyas there were who were citizens of Argentina70 During that era mostof the Italian immigrants were laborers but at the same time most ofArgentinas masons seamen tradespeople architects importersengineers and restaurant and hotel owners were also Italian71The Argentine government itself recognized differences betweenimmigrants from different countries in Europe and sought to attractpeople from outside the Spanish culture prevailing in Argentina Theydeliberately sought at first to attract immigrants from Britain Germanyand Scandinavia but without much success so they then welcomedimmigrants from Italy and Spain preferably Northern Italians andBasques from Spain people with very different cultures from those insouthern Italy or in the rest of Spain Basques for example beingnoted for being thrifty and hard workers72 The Argentinegovernment also sent agents to Europe to recruit Germans there73Volga Germans settled in what then became Argentinas wheat belt74While people from outside the prevailing Spanish culture ofArgentina dominated much of that countrys economy Argentinesdominated its political institutions In the early twentieth centuryArgentina was one of the worlds most prosperous nations rankingabove France and Germany for example75 But by the middle of thetwentieth century disastrous political policies dropped Argentina outof the front ranks of nations economically Despite its rich soil andother natural advantages including a location that spared it frombeing devastated by two World Wars like nations in EuropeArgentinas political culture destroyed the prosperity that thecountry s economy had once enjoyed Messianic politicaldemagoguery and class warfare rhetoric and policies epitomized byJuan Peron and his wife Evita patroness of the shirtless oneswere part of an economically counterproductive pattern that beganbefore them and continued long after their time nullifying both theadvantages provided by nature and the human capital supplied largelyby foreigners whether immigrants or international investors andentrepreneurs Implications and Prospects 203Argentina was by no means the only country in Latin Americawhose economic advancement was heavily dependent on foreignersespecially those from countries other than the founding nations ofSpain or Portugal to develop its economy As late as the midtwentiethcentury in Brazils most industrialized states So PauloRio Grande do Sul and Santa Catarina most of the industrialistswere recent European immigrants or their children In So Paulo 521enterprises out of 714 were owned by men in these categories In RioGrande do Sul and in Santa Catarina nearly fourfifths of theindustries were developed by people of similar description76Germans and Italians were especially prominent In the state of RioGrande do Sul Germans in the early twentieth century were the soleproducers of metal furniture trunks stoves paper hats necktiesleather soap glass matches beer confections and carriages as well asthe sole owners of foundries and carpentry shops77Not only in industry but also in agriculture immigrants weresought from outside the Iberian peninsula The government of Brazillike the government of Argentina deliberately recruited Germans inEurope78 to be immigrants who would not be reluctant to do thehard physical labor of pioneering in the wilderness nor weredisdainful of it like people from the Portuguese culture of Brazil andthe Spanish culture of Argentina The state of So Paulo subsidizedthe immigration of Italian peasants79 The governments of Chile andParaguay likewise deliberately sought European immigrants fromoutside the Iberian peninsula for the hard work and severe livingconditions that went with pioneering in opening up virginwildernesses in these countries80In short these governments recognized cultural differences in thework habits skills and values required to develop their countrieswhether in agriculture or in industry and commerce despite howevermuch the recognition of such differences may be taboo in many placestoday In the words of distinguished French historian FernandBraudel it was immigrants who created modern Brazil modernArgentina modern Chile81204 Wealth Poverty and PoliticsNot all these immigrants were from Europe Japanese immigrantsplayed a significant role in the economies of Brazil and PeruAlthough the Japanese were only 2 to 3 percent of the population inBrazils state of So Paulo and owned less than 2 percent of its landthey produced nearly 30 percent of the states agricultural output inthe early 1930s including 46 percent of the cotton 57 percent ofthe silk and 75 percent of the tea A substantial proportion of thebanana plantations were also in Japanese hands82Peru was another Latin American nation in which a small numberof Japanese immigrants played a disproportionate role in theeconomy Beginning in the late nineteenth and early twentiethcenturies as agricultural laborers working under conditions that led tohigh death rates83 the Japanese in Peru soon moved into urbancommunities where they began working in occupations ranging fromdomestic servants to small business owners84 Eventually theJapanese owned threequarters of all the barbershops and 200 grocerystores in Perus capital city Lima Even as agricultural laborers theJapanese work habits made them more in demand than Peruvianworkers and the Japanese laborers were paid more85The Japanese acquired a reputation not only for hard work butalso for reliability and honesty86 They also took more interest thanPeruvians in the education of their children The illiteracy rate in Peruwas 79 percent in 1876 and though it declined over the generations58 percent of the population was still illiterate in 194087Manufacturing firms in Peru during this era were usually controlledeither by foreigners or by recent immigrants Like other minority groups who have been more successful thanmembers of the majority population in other times and places theJapanese were resented in Peru These resentments were expressed ineditorial criticisms and in boycotts of Japaneseowned businessesthough these boycotts failed because the Japanese usually chargedlower prices than others88 However political measures against theJapanese were more effective These included a law requiring at leastImplications and Prospects 20580 percent of all employees to be Peruvians89 and immigration fromJapan was severely restricted in the mid1930s90In Chile foreigners in general played a disproportionate role in thedevelopment of the countrys economy As late as the middle of thetwentieth century most of the industrial enterprises in Santiago Chilewere controlled by either immigrants or the children of immigrants91Nor was this an unusual pattern in Latin America where there has oftenbeen an overrepresentation sometimes an absolute predominanceof nonHispanic nonPortuguese immigrants and their children amongthe leading commercial and industrial figures of various countries92Disdain for commerce and industry at the higher social levels ofHispanic and Portuguese societies whether in Europe or amongtheir Western Hemisphere offshoots has been paralleled by anaversion to manual labor and hard work at the lower social levelsWhat has been involved in such attitudes has not been simplelaziness but what a scholar writing about seventeenthcentury Spaincharacterized as pride in indolence reflecting an aversion to thestigma associated with manual work in that culture93Centuries later Paraguayans were bewildered by the unrelentingwork of people in Japanese agricultural colonies in their country94and Honduran farmers complained that it was unfair for them to haveto compete with German farmers in their country since the latterwere considered to be working too hard95Latin America has by no means been unique on the world stage innot simply failing to reach the standards of productivity set by othersbut in positively rejecting resenting and restricting those who weremore productive and explaining away their own lags by blamingexploitation by others at home and abroad Latin Americanintellectuals led the way in developing dependency theory blamingthe lags of South Americans on North Americans and othersEventually the striking success of Asian countries that opened theireconomies to foreign trade foreign investors and foreign technologyeroded the foundations of dependency theory in Latin America Butnot before whole generations had paid the price of this selfindulgence 206 Wealth Poverty and PoliticsWhen considering cultural or other factors timing must beconsidered among the reasons for particular outcomes Finallyabandoning dependency theory offered the possibility for moreeconomic progress but the negative effects of all the years when thattheory was an obstacle to economic growth were not negatedSimilarly a nation whose population remained illiterate while literacybecame widespread among other nations will of course benefit fromfinally bringing literacy to its own people but that will not put itspeople on a par with people in countries where literacy has been thenorm for generations or for centuriesTiming is important in another sense It has long been observedthat a transplanted culture is less subject to change than the culture inits country of origin Thus many words and phrases in the Frenchspoken in Quebec and in the Spanish spoken in Mexico have becomearchaic in France and Spain Some of the counterproductive attitudesthat Latin America inherited from Spain have been said to havebegun to change in Spain itself more so than in Latin America96It is hard to escape the fact that former British colonies properthat is countries founded by a transplanted British population havegenerally done better economically than former Spanish orPortuguese colonies Nor can this be due to the British Empireshaving made better initial choices as to places to settle because theSpanish Empire was established first giving Spain the first choicesSpaniards conquered lands and peoples in both North America andSouth America in the 16th century before the first permanent Britishsettlement in America was established tenuously at Jamestown in the17th centuryFACING  THE  FACTS AND  THE  FUTUREIn dealing with the social and economic problems involvingwealth poverty and politics specific policy prescriptions are notnecessarily the most urgent need Blueprints for Utopia are availableImplications and Prospects 207in abundance What are not nearly so abundant are prerequisites forrational thinking about current problems and future alternatives Themost important of these prerequisites is the truth Whateverdestination we are seeking either literally or figuratively we can onlyget there from where we are This means that we must first know thetruth about where we are in order to advance toward our destination If our physical destination is Hawaii then we must first knowwhether we are currently east west north or south of HawaiiOtherwise we are likely to head in the wrong direction to get there Ifthe destination we wish to reach is figurative and social rather thangeographic the same principle applies If we wish to promote theeconomic or other advancement of black Americans for example weneed to know the truth about where black Americans are now notwhere we might wish they were or where some blacks might prefer tobelieve they are or to have others believe they are but where they arein fact in truth Wrong premises seldom lead to correct conclusionsWhat are the obstacles to knowing the truthUnfortunately these obstacles are all too plain and all toonumerous They include things you cannot say even with a mountainof empirical evidence behind you and other things you can shoutfrom the rooftops without a speck of evidence behind you and indefiance of whatever evidence exists to the contrary This is nowheremore true than on college and university campuses where either astudent or a professor publicly speaking unpalatable truths about anyminority group currently in favor risks adverse reactions ranging frombecoming an instant social pariah to punishment under campusspeech codes to physical harassment and threats of violenceMeanwhile there are other things that can be said no matter howdemonstrably false with little risk of even criticism much lessdiscrediting Unfortunately arbitrary premises that are demonstrably false andmisleading abound in all too many settings whether in academia themedia or in government One of the most pervasive of these falsepremises is one that we have already noted the assumption that208 Wealth Poverty and Politicsdisparities in economic outcomes among nations or among groupswithin nations are symptoms of malign actions by others Thisimplicit assumption of equal outcomes in the absence of malice fliesin the face of evidence from around the world that geographicdemographic cultural and other factors influencing outcomes are noteven approximately equal Nor are performances in purely individualendeavors that can be objectively measured such as individualperformances in sports chess or spelling bees all of which showhighly skewed distributions of successGiven the many things that go into economic productivity and themany differences among people in their likelihood of having thosethings there is a major difference between equal opportunity and equalchances of achieving a given outcome a difference often ignored orblurredEven a Nobel Prizewinning economist like Joseph Stiglitz saysthat one way of looking at equality of opportunity is to ask to whatextent the life chances of a child are dependent on the education andincome of his parents More specifically he asks Is it just as likelythat a child of poor or poorly educated parents gets a good educationand rises to the middle class as someone born to middleclass parentswith college degrees As evidence of unequal opportunities he saysLatinos and AfricanAmericans still get paid less than whites andwomen still get paid less than men According to Professor StiglitzAmericans are coming to realize that their cherished narrative ofsocial and economic mobility is a myth97If equal opportunity and equal probability of success are usedinterchangeably what does that accomplish It finesses aside thequestion whether some people make better use of their opportunitiesthan other people do When Asian students outnumber white studentsby more than twotoone in each of New York Citys three elite publichigh schools Stuyvesant Bronx Science and Brooklyn Tech98 arewe to say that whites are being denied equal opportunity Are we to say that this must mean that Asians have higher incomesand more education than whites even when we know that ChineseImplications and Prospects 209immigrants from Fujian province have neither Are we to equateequal opportunity with equal chances even when we know that thechildren of black doctors and lawyers in affluent Shaker Heightsneglect their studies99Words matter So does the slippery use of words which caninsinuate what they cannot substantiate To people who are seekingthe truth it is a crucial question whether or to what extent thosegroups who are less successful are being thwarted by externalbarriers that is by less opportunity or instead are less successfulbecause of their own internal deficiencies in knowledge disciplinevalues or other things that affect their life chances But to people whoare seeking ideological victory that is precisely the question to be keptoff the agendaIf Joseph Stiglitz prefers to make life chances his issue that is hisprerogative But to claim that he has refuted other peoples belief insocial mobility as a myth is to impute his conception of socialmobility to those other people And to cite as evidence incomedifferences between blacks and whites or between women and men isto add to the confusion when many if not most Americans wouldtake that to mean that external discrimination must be the reason Yet innumerable empirical studies have shown that blacks andwhites as groups do not have the same job qualifications and thatwomen and men likewise differ in many of the things that go intoeconomic advancement beginning with the simple fact that womenaverage fewer hours of employment per year and fewer years ofcontinuous employment among many other consequentialdifferences100As far back as 1971 those single women who had workedcontinuously from high school into their thirties were earning slightlymore than men of the same description101 even though women as agroup were not earning as much as men as a group were earning Asfar back as academic year 197273 while black academics as a groupearned less than white academics as a group nevertheless those blackacademics with PhDs from equally highranked universities as210 Wealth Poverty and Politicswhites and with equal numbers of articles published earned morethan white academics of the same description102The approach of Professor Stiglitz is by no means uniqueRedefining words is a major part of the ideological arsenal of incomeredistributionists in general whether discussing the less successful orthe more successful members of society When discussing the latterthe very concept of achievement is often replaced by the concept ofprivilege For example another writer has argued that incomestatistics show unambiguously that persons of IrishCatholicethnicity were the second most privileged group in US societyadjudged on the basis of annual income educational level andoccupational prestige with Jews being the most privileged103What makes this statement grotesque is that Irish and Jewishimmigrants were among the most desperately poor of the immigrantswho arrived in the United States in the nineteenth century and livedin a poverty and squalor unseen today and virtually inconceivabletoday That the Irish and the Jews rose from such painful beginnings toprosperity in the next century is an achievement not a privilege Thatthey did so in the face of once common employers notices that saidNo Irish Need Apply and in the face of quota limits on how manyJewish students would be admitted to Harvard and other eliteuniversities and even smaller limits usually zero on how manyJewish professors would be appointed during the preWorld War IIera makes their achievements more striking even as others now tryto make those achievements vanish by the verbal magic of callingthem privileges Even middleclass blacks have been described asprivileged104 though their ancestors were by no means brought toAmerica as doctors lawyers or teachersThe same word games are played in discussions of groupdifferences in outcomes in foreign countries and not simply bypoliticians or journalists but in serious academic publications ThusMalays in Malaysia for example have been referred to asdeprived105 and nonMalays as having privilege106 despiteImplications and Prospects 211pervasive governmentmandated preferences for Malays in bothpublic and private institutions Similarly Canadians of Japaneseancestry in Toronto have been described as privileged because theyhave achieved higher incomes than others in that city107 despite aprior history of severe antiJapanese discrimination in Canadaclimaxed by internment during the Second World War for longerthan Japanese Americans were interned108In short the achievements of these and other groups after longand hard struggles upward are made to vanish from discussion by asimple substitution of the word privilege for the wordachievement even though privilege refers to a condition thatexists ex ante and achievement refers to a condition that exists ex postMore fundamentally these tactics remove behavior and productivityfrom discussions of intergroup economic disparities So too does thetactic of arbitrarily dismissing any negative information aboutparticular groups as stereotypes Such verbal virtuosity is an obstacleto truth simply by corrupting the words that might otherwise conveyunwelcome truths that redistributionists avoidMoreover by focusing on the rewards received for achievementssuch statements ignore the benefits of those achievements for otherswhich is the very reason that those others whether employerspatients customers or other recipients of the goods or services thatpeople with these achievements produce are willing to pay theirown money to receive those benefits As in many other contextsproductivity vanishes into thin air by verbal sleight of hand whendiscussing the income distribution that results from thatproductivity It is as if all that matters is the income differencebetween A and B ignoring the benefits of their respectiveachievements for C D E and many othersPreoccupation with the differential benefits to those with variousachievements too often obscures the benefits of those achievements tosociety as a whole Back in prehistoric times whoever invented thewheel or whoever first figured out how to start a fire may well haveacquired an advantage over others but surely what is most important212 Wealth Poverty and Politicsis that these things were major additions to the human capital ofmankind in its infancy It might well have been even better if everyoneall over the world had acquired these advances at the same time Butsurely what is far more important than this theoretical possibility is thatthese fundamental advances were in fact made in the real world as thehuman race began its long advance toward civilizationWhen some children today are raised in ways that make it easierfor them to become doctors scientists or engineers that is not simplya differential advantage over other children who are raised in waysthat make it more likely that they will become welfare recipients orcriminals These are differences that affect the wellbeing of thewhole society Yet there are academics who deplore college admissionsdecisions based on the academic qualifications of individualapplicants because in their view this is simply rewarding those whohave already been privileged The consequences for society ofdifferent admissions criteria are considerations that simply vanishinto thin air just as with the group activist in Nigeria who deploredthe tyranny of skills109In a sense there is indeed a tyranny of skills though it existsindependently of a given institution or a given society because ofinherent realities beyond our control The presence or absence ofmedical skills for example can be the difference between life anddeath for millions of people That is an inherent reality ortyranny we cannot escape All that a given institution or society cando is recognize the value of skills or else subordinate skills to socialpreconceptions or political expediency Skills confer benefits even onthose who do not have skills When a graduate of a selective publichigh school and a selective city college in New York created a poliovaccine that was a boon to people of every income level and everyrace color creed and nationality around the world Frequent expressions of astonishment at how large the differencesin rewards are between individuals groups or nations seldom lead toquestions as to whether what is produced by those who receive theserewards differs correspondingly It is not so much thatImplications and Prospects 213redistributionists give different answers to that question than othersgive More fundamentally that question is seldom asked much lessanswered Here again production usually remains somewhere in thedim background as something that just happens somehowStudies of people who became genuinely rich with huge fortuneslike that of John D Rockefeller may abound with assertions abouttheir greed But those who use such characterizations seldom posethe most basic question What did Rockefeller supply to others thatcaused so many of those others to turn their own individually modestsums of money over to him adding up to his vast fortune Despite the frequency with which greed is invoked in thiscontext it explains absolutely nothing unless you believe that aninsatiable desire for money will itself cause others to pay you thatmoney But regardless of how often this causally meaninglessexplanation greed has passed muster among the intelligentsia amore oldfashioned expression conveys a more fundamental truth Ifwishes were horses beggars would ride Greed may or may not be anaccurate characterization of any given individual but wishes cannotexplain why others provide the money to satisfy those wishes Nor is the amount of wealth received even a barometer of greed Asmalltime criminal who robs a little momandpop store and kills theowner to keep from being identified is surely greedy even if themoney received from the robbery is trivial compared to what anengineer or a surgeon earns honestly in a month In the case of John D Rockefeller his fortune began in thenineteenth century with his reducing the price of kerosene to afraction of what it was before his innovations in production anddistribution greatly reduced the cost of producing and delivering thisproduct to consumers110 For example the units in which we measureoil today are barrels even though oil is no longer actually shipped inbarrels but in tankers due to Rockefellers costsaving shift to railroadtanker carsAs of the time when this happened light bulbs had not yet beeninvented so the ancient saying The night cometh when no man can214 Wealth Poverty and Politicswork still applied to all who could not afford to use candles or oilburning sources of light for hours at a time each night Many workingclass people had few options besides going to bed when nightfallcame Only after Rockefellers innovations in production anddistribution cut the cost of kerosene to a fraction of what it had beenbefore were ordinary people able to afford to stay up for hours afterdark using kerosene lamps What such people were purchasing were hundreds of hours ofadditional light per year It is hardly surprising that millions of peoplewere willing to pay to enlarge their lives in this way We take so many of the benefits of todays world for granted thatit is hard to conceive of how different life was in the world of earliertimes much less grasp the full impact of landmark advances thatenabled people to transcend the severe limitations of those times It has been estimated for example that most Americans in theearly nineteenth century lived out their entire lives and died within afiftymile radius of where they were born111 The railroad and theautomobile expanded their world to vastly larger dimensionsespecially in the early twentieth century after Henry Fords massproduction methods drastically reduced the cost of producing anautomobile This changed cars from being luxuries of the rich tobeing accessible to the masses The fortune made by Henry Ford was an incidental byproduct ofthis historic expansion of productivity that expanded the lives ofmillions Why third parties should imagine themselves entitled tointervene in such processes to which they contributed nothing andto preempt the decisions of others decisions for which theinterventionists pay no price when they are wrong is one of themany mysteries of our timeMany fortunes of historic dimensions came from producing a newproduct or making an old product either better or cheaper or both Inless spectacular ways as well other people who have acquired otherskills are paid for what those skills add to the lives of other peoplewhether these are the skills of doctors curing diseases or the skills ofImplications and Prospects 215pilots transporting hundreds of people thousands of miles Acquiringvaluable skills to do these and other things is an achievement thatbenefits others rather than a privilege that benefits only themselvesat the expense of others The difference is fundamental regardless ofhow much verbal cleverness goes into obscuring that differenceRedistributionists may demand proof that all fortunes or all highincomes are earned that way but this is putting the burden of proofon others instead of putting the burden of proof on those who seekto restrict the freedom of their fellow human beings to live their ownlives and make their own economic decisions as they see fit There isno reason why the divine right of kings from earlier centuries shouldbe inherited by todays intelligentsia or politiciansAre there imperfections in a market economy Yes There areimperfections in all things human including alternatives to the marketeconomy As a distinguished scholar put it The study of humaninstitutions is always a search for the most tolerable imperfections112None of this means that the status quo must be maintained Itcannot be and has not been Even leading conservative figuresranging from Edmund Burke in the eighteenth century to MiltonFriedman in the twentieth century have advocated major socialchanges The fact that they opposed some other changes does notmean that they opposed change as such But the word change is nota blank check for selfindulgence least of all selfindulgence in thenotion that disparities imply villainy which in turn implies a crusadeon the side of the angels against the forces of evil despite how selfflattering such a vision of the world might be 216 Wealth Poverty and Politics  In addition to devoting years to the impeachment of the British viceroy of Indiaon grounds that he oppressed the native peoples Burke advocated the abolition ofslavery at a time when that was a distinctly minority view in Western civilizationand virtually a nonexistent view in nonWestern societies Burke even drew upplans for preparing slaves for freedom and providing them with property with whichto begin their lives as free people  Milton Friedman proposed sweeping changes inpublic schools and in the Federal Reserve System as well as a negative income taxto transfer money to lowincome people Burke said A state without the means ofsome change is without the means of its conservation and Milton Friedman wrotea book titled The Tyranny of the Status Quo  An even more dangerous illusion is that the undoubted unfairnessof life chances is a reason to give politicians ever more control of anations resources and ever more power over our individual lives Thetrack record of that approach is at the very least sobering wheneven most socialist and communist governments had been forced bycounterproductive consequences to abandon economic centralplanning by the end of the twentieth century and when the materialbenefits of an expansive welfare state to some in England and theUnited States have been accompanied by painful social retrogressionsto the detriment of each society as a wholeMost important of all whatever changes are made must begin withthe truth about our current situation whether that truth is palatableor unpalatable if change is to mean progress To the extent that thisbook has offered at least a slice of that truth it has achieved itspurpose Drawing up policy blueprints is a task for which there hasnever been a shortage of eager candidates We can only hope thatthose policies will be based on hard facts about the real world ratherthan on rhetoric or preconceptionsImplications and Prospects 217EPILOGUEFew subjects provoke such strong emotions as differences inincome and wealth especially when these are differences betweengroups into which individuals are born and usually remain for lifesuch as races castes tribes or nations in descending order ofpermanence People can change nationality by immigrating butchanging race is an option available to a relatively few people ofhybrid ancestry and not without psychic costs to those fewincluding costs which such people have often refused to pay whichwould have been the consequence of abandoning the race into whichthey were bornPeople born into groups defined by religion such as Jews orMormons all have an option to redesignate themselves but likewiseusually do not Therefore concerns and resentments over groupdifferences in income and wealth engage the emotions of manyindividuals who may be doing quite well economically themselves butwho belong to groups that are not Indeed even where both theindividual and the group to which that individual belongs areprospering more so than the rest of society there are moral issues raised218  Among black Americans such historic figures as Homer Plessy of Plessy v Fergusonfame and Walter White the midtwentieth century head of the National Associationfor the Advancement of Colored People were physically indistinguishable from whitemen but remained socially black by choice The landmark Supreme Court case ofPlessy v Ferguson was made possible only because Plessys attorney gave prior noticeto the railroad company involved that a man classified as black would challenge racialsegregation by traveling in a railroad car legally designated as for whites only HadPlessy simply seated himself in that car without explicitly proclaiming his racialclassification there is little reason to believe that he would have been questionedmuch less prosecuted but the whole point was to have a legal case to pursue in orderto challenge racial segregation laws in the courtsabout whether the less fortunate are receiving not only enough for adecent life but also social justice however that term might be defined The strong emotions surrounding issues of income and wealthmake careful and honest uses of words especially important ifour goal is truth and not simply ideological victory in a contest offencing with words Among the careful distinctions we need to makeis the distinction between causation and blame and between thegeneral unfairness of life and the question of specific unfairness inparticular institutions or in particular societies CAUSATIONBoth moral and causal arguments are important but amalgamatingthe two even implicitly is a formula for confusion perhapsexemplified in the catch phrase blaming the victim Whetherparticular individuals groups or nations with poorer outcomes are infact victims of others is precisely the question that is preempted by thisphrase There is no question that for an individual to be born blind orcrippled is a tragic misfortune but that in itself does not mean thatsomeone has victimized that individual There are after all causesbesides humans various geographic features being obvious examplesFor a group a race or a nation to be located in a geographic setting thataffords far less promising prospects of either prosperity or progress canbe a major fundamental misfortune but that in itself does not meanthat some other people have victimized them Determining where some disadvantage to particular individuals orgroups originated is often no easy matter Because data collected at agiven institution may convey a certain negative outcome does not meanthat the institution where those data were collected caused that outcomeSome hospitals have significantly higher death rates than othersprecisely because they have the most highly skilled doctors and the mostadvanced medical technology and therefore treat patients with themost difficult lifethreatening medical problems that some otherEpilogue 219hospitals are simply not equipped to handle A hospital that treatsmostly people with routine medical conditions such as child birth orbroken legs may well have a lower death rate than a hospital whichperforms operations like brain surgery or heart transplants Higher deathrates at more advanced hospitals convey a reality that these hospitals didnot cause That reality in this case is that its patients have more severeafflictions for which neither they nor the hospital are to blameSimilarly with outcomes in economic and social institutions wherenegative outcomes at particular institutions are often more or lessautomatically taken to mean that it was these institutions whichcaused negative results that the data collected there conveyed Whenfor example statistics on the employment pay and promotion ofpeople from different ethnic backgrounds are collected at a particularbusiness differences in these respects from one group to another donot mean that the cause of such differences must have originated atthose businesses where data conveying these differences originatedOften other data or just common observations show childrenbeing raised differently in different groups and behaving andperforming differently in schools or in society as they grew up yearsbefore they reached a particular employer Yet courts of law haveaccepted disparate impact statistics collected at particular businessesas evidence of discrimination by those particular businesses In thesame vein group differences in results on particular tests are oftentaken to mean that these tests are biased when the scores on thesetests convey differences among the participants which these tests areaccused of causing by asking questions geared to a white culture forexample even when Asian Americans in fact score higher thanwhites on these testsIndividuals groups races and nations may be handicapped by theircultural settings as they have been handicapped by their geographicsettings In either case their misfortunes do not necessarily meanvictimhood which requires people who are victimizing others Whilecultures are manmade they were usually made jointly by people longdead before the present generation was born and these cultures were220 Wealth Poverty and Politicscertainly not made with malice against future descendants In shortmisfortunes cannot automatically be transmuted into victimhood by acatch phrase not if one is serious about the truth rather than fencingwith words To suggest that there can be cultural patterns inconsistentwith progress in the world as it has evolved is not to blame thevictim except for those who are satisfied with trying to verbally turnthe tables on people who speak unwelcome truthsThe Localization of BlamePeople who seek blame rather than causation often also seek alocalized source of evil to blame Professor Paul Krugman forexample refers to slavery as Americas original sin1 when in factslavery was a virtually universal evil around the world for thousandsof years of recorded history Would anyone refer to cancer asAmericas horrible disease No doubt cancer has been a dreadfulaffliction for many Americans but it is not a localized affliction Whatwas different about Americans was not that they suffered the ravagesof cancer but that American doctors and medical researchers led thefight against cancer resulting in Americans having the worlds highestrate of survival against various forms of cancer2In parallel fashion slavery was not peculiar to the United States towhite society or to Western civilization What was peculiar toWestern civilization was not that it had slavery like nonWesterncivilizations around the world but that Western civilization waswhere the drive to destroy slavery began a drive that lasted morethan a century fought on many fronts and succeeded over theopposition of nonWestern societies3 Only the military dominance ofthe West in the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries allowed theWest to impose the abolition of slavery on the countries it conqueredor threatened along with many other things good bad or mixedimposed during the era of Western imperialismReferring to slavery as Americas original sin was not a verbal slippeculiar to Professor Krugman Many intellectuals and others act as ifEpilogue 221222 Wealth Poverty and Politicsenslavement of fellow human beings was peculiar to the white race orgross economic inequalities peculiar to capitalism or imperialismdespite a vast historical record to the contrary and despite othereconomic and social systems and other races and religions leaving atrail of horrors matching or exceeding anything in the West or undercapitalism or imperialismEvils common to human beings around the world and acrossthousands of years of recorded history do not provide as promising atarget for ideological crusades as evils attributable to an identifiablelocalized source of evil that can be removed and replaced by whateverone puts ones faith in But universal evils or failings of human beingscan mean that even the most sweeping devastating and bloodyvictory over those currently in power may produce only a change inthe cast of characters without changing the tragedy itself Thetyranny and carnage that followed the French Revolution was at leastas horrible as the horrors of the old regime it replaced In thetwentieth century the replacement of oppressive monarchicaldynasties by Communist Fascist and Nazi dictatorships was a majorchange for the worseThe false narrative of Americas original sin has led to other falsenarratives including the legacy of slavery as a blanket explanation ofvarious forms of social pathology in todays black ghettos With bothfalse narratives sheer repetition has substituted for empiricalverification The question is seldom asked much less answered as towhether todays levels of oneparent families or murder rates amongblacks have existed since the time of slavery or have escalated topresent levels largely since the 1960s As of 1960 most black childrenwere still being raised in twoparent families which have become theexception rather than the rule after the 1960sNor was the level of violence in black communities in general orin housing projects in particular at the levels of today While it is truehistorically that rates of both broken families and violence werehigher in black communities than in the American population atlarge that was not uncommon among other lowincome groupswhether in the United States or in other countries and whether or notthe lowincome groups had been enslaved But neither oneparentfamilies nor violent crime was as high among black Americans in themiddle of the twentieth century as today Homicide rates amongblack males were in fact declining substantially during the muchlamented 1950s but this trend abruptly reversed during the muchcelebrated 1960s and rose sharply to significantly higher levels than ineither 1950 or 19604 Labor force participation rates were higheramong blacks than among whites in every census from 1890 to 1970but the reverse has been true for every year since 19725 This reversaloccurred in the wake of the expansion of the welfare state not in thewake of slaveryThe fundamental problem is not that some people were notfamiliar with these facts The fundamental problem was that theychose to make sweeping assertions without bothering to check thefacts and that their sweeping assertions have been widely acceptedand repeated in the absence of supporting facts and in defiance ofreadily available contrary factsMultiple CausationThe fact that the human species achieved nothing that we todaywould consider to be civilization until well within the last 10 percentof its existence has weighty implications for our times Even racesand nations that are today considered the most backward are moreadvanced than any race was during most of the existence of thehuman species Were all the races of the world genetically inferior forall those scores of millennia Or was some other factor or factorsholding them back The most obvious factor was isolation in prehistoric times as inlater times Huntergatherers could travel only so far and couldinteract with only so many other huntergatherers in ancient timesHow could a huntergatherer in Scandinavia even suspect theexistence of other huntergatherers in Asia or even Southern EuropeEpilogue 223much less interchange goods or thoughts with them acrosscontinents and certainly not interchange genes Even today we lookin vain for breakthroughs on the frontiers of knowledge from peopleliving on isolated islands or in remote mountain villages or frompeople living anywhere who are isolated by illiteracy Such people mayhave all they can do to survive much less try to keep up with whatother people in more advanced settings are doingAt a minimum this suggests that the truly isolated human beingdenied even vicarious contact with the rest of his species throughreading about them is incapable of achieving even a small fraction ofwhat his potential might be if immersed in the knowledge created byhis contemporaries and heir to the knowledge of the manygenerations that went before him Indeed even a hundred or athousand isolated human beings knowing only each other andnothing about other contemporaries or predecessors have seldom ifever produced anything the world has bothered to notice Yet there is no evidence that human genes changed drasticallywithin the last 5 or 10 percent of human existence Nor is there anyhard evidence that the specific races that made the first worldchanging advances in agriculture in the Middle East on the Indiansubcontinent or in ancient China were genetically superior then ornow These are certainly not the most prosperous or the mostadvanced regions todayWhat seems far more likely in this context as in many others isthat a large number of factors had to come together and interact inorder to produce a particular outcome such as civilization Most ofthose factors might well have been present for millennia butimpotent without the other factor or factors needed to complete theprerequisites for civilization Yet once agriculture was established ona scale sufficient to permit or promote urbanization there beganmany advances within the last few millennia of recorded historyacross a wide sweep of human endeavors by descendants of peoplewho previously did not even know how to plant seeds to grow foodYet this development of civilization led ultimately to people who can224 Wealth Poverty and Politicsnow travel to the moon and send complex scientific instrumentsthroughout the solar system and beyond into outer space Thisenormous disparity of achievements between different eras of humanexistence dwarfs disparities between rich and poor contemporaries inthe world of today Yet this vast disparity between the achievementsof different eras hardly seems explicable by either victimhood orgeneticsThis scenario of progress has yet to be played out fully in theAmazon jungles or in other isolated places around the world eventhough people in such places have benefitted as consumers ofproducts created by fellow human beings in more fortunate settingsIf a number of factors have to come together in order to producea given outcome whether tornadoes or economic advances thenit is possible that a number of those factors may come together in anumber of places while all of the factors come together in very fewplaces or even in only one If there are ten factors required for successin a particular endeavor individuals or groups with nine of thosefactors will not necessarily do 90 percent as well They may be utterfailures The net result can be a very skewed distribution of outcomeswhether the particular outcome is most of the worlds tornadoesoccurring in just one country or a trio of professional golfers winningmore than 200 PGA tournaments while most professional golfersnever win even a single PGA tournament in their entire careers Most notable economic scientific or intellectual achievementsinvolve many factors beginning with a desire to succeed in theparticular endeavor without which all the ability and opportunitymean nothing just as the desire and the opportunity mean nothingwithout the ability What this implies among other things is that anindividual a people or a nation may have some many or most of theprerequisites for a given achievement without having any real successin producing that achievement And yet that individual that peopleor that nation may suddenly burst upon the scene with spectacularsuccess when whatever the missing factor or factors are finally getadded to the mix Epilogue 225Poor and backward nations that suddenly moved to the forefrontof human achievements include Scotland in the nineteenth centuryand Japan in the twentieth century But there have been other socialphenomena pointing in the same direction as examples of multiplecausationWe have become so used to seeing numerous worldclassperformances by Jewish intellectual figures that it is necessary toreflect that this has been a phenomenon that burst upon the world inthe nineteenth and twentieth centuries There were individual Jewishintellectuals of international stature here and there in earlier centuriesbut the proliferation of Jewish Nobel Prize winners across numerousfields in the twentieth century was a new and unpredictablephenomenon Since Jews existed as a separate people for thousands ofyears before and had a long tradition of reverence for learning mostof the factors required for their breakout in the nineteenth centurymay already have been present But for centuries Jews were deniedthe rights of Christians in Europe or the rights of Muslims in theMiddle East and these included access to universitiesThe first Christian nation in which Jews had the same rights asother people was the United States late in the eighteenth centurywhen the American Constitution simply forbad religious distinctionsin the law After the French Revolution in 1789 France also grantedequal rights to Jews As restrictions against Jews began to erode inEurope Jews began to flow and then to flood into universities Themissing ingredient had apparently been added Conversely when a given individual group institution or nationhas already had a highly successful combination of factors for manyyears either internal changes in just one of those factors or changesin external circumstances can suddenly drop that institution thatpeople or that nation out of the top ranks in the particular endeavorThus the Eastman Kodak Company s global dominance inphotographic equipment and supplies for more than a century cameto a sudden end in the early twentyfirst century including a declineinto bankruptcy when the worldwide shift to digital cameras made226 Wealth Poverty and Politicsfilm film cameras and the chemicals and equipment for developingfilm obsolete Chinas historic decline over the centuries from an advancednation in the forefront of human progress to a Third World countryprey to more powerful nations in many ways began with a decision byits fifteenth century rulers to isolate China from the outside worldLoss of just one prerequisite rulers rational enough to avoidirreparably selfdestructive policies was enough to negate all theother positive qualities that had for centuries given China historicachievements Just as a combination of prerequisites for success in a particularendeavor may deny success to individuals groups institutions ornations that may have most of those prerequisites but not all so mayvariations in the number or kind of prerequisites from one endeavorto another let individuals or groups seriously lagging in some or mostother endeavors nevertheless be not merely competent butoutstanding or even dominant in particular endeavors that do notrequire the particular qualities or circumstances that they do not haveeven if there is fierce competition within the particular endeavor inwhich they compete Thus during the era when Irish American immigrants and theiroffspring were overrepresented among unskilled laborers anddomestic servants they were also among the leading performers insuch sports as boxing and baseball and among popular entertainersSports and entertainment are highly competitive fields with manytrying but few succeeding Yet the crucial qualities skills and talentstend to be individual and do not require an elaborate infrastructure offormal education or long years of training by specialists which fewpoor people can afford Other lowincome Americans lacking ineducational traditions or highlevel industrial or commercialEpilogue 227  The irony in all this is that Eastman Kodak could hardly have been caught bysurprise by the emergence of digital cameras since the digital camera was inventedwithin Eastman Kodak As in many other contexts having facts is not the same asseeing the implications of those factsexperience have followed in the footsteps of Irish Americans notonly in sports and entertainment in general but even in many of thevery same kinds of sports and entertainment in which IrishAmericans once excelled so strikingly that is boxing and baseballrather than polo or golf popular music rather than symphonic musicvaudeville performers rather than ballet dancers or Shakespeareanactors However demanding the skills or talents and however rare theindividuals able to reach the peaks when the prerequisites forparticular endeavors did not include an elaborate formalinfrastructure such as that required to become a scientist a surgeonor an engineer economically and educationally lagging groups haveoften been overrepresented not only numerically but especiallyamong the star performersA whole succession of Irish American boxing champions in thenineteenth and early twentieth centuries from the era of John LSullivan to that of Gene Tunney was followed by a succession of blackAmerican boxing champions beginning in the 1930s with thelegendary Joe Louis who still holds the record for oneroundknockouts in heavyweight championship fights Decades later the eraof black boxing champions was succeeded by an era of HispanicAmerican boxing champions Similarly in baseball where despite aban on black players in the major leagues until 1947 which is to saymore than half a century after major league baseball began therewere seven consecutive years when no white man won the NationalLeagues Most Valuable Player award6 and now 5 of the top 10players who hit the most home runs in their careers are black7 Heretoo the era of black dominance among baseball stars was followed by228 Wealth Poverty and Politics  There was an isolated black heavyweight champion Jack Johnson beginningin 1908 but the succession of black champions began with Joe Louisan era when a wholly disproportionate number of baseball stars wereHispanicIt was not only among some ethnic groups but also among whiteSoutherners that a lagging group in economic and educational termsproduced many stars in sports and entertainment Although whiteSoutherners have long been no more than onethird of the whitepopulation of the country in baseball four of the top five highestlifetime batting averages were by white players born in the SouthTy Cobb 367 in Georgia Rogers Hornsby 358 in Texas ShoelessJoe Jackson 356 in South Carolina and Tris Speaker 345 in TexasThe lone nonSoutherner among the top five Ed Delahanty hada lifetime batting average of 3468 His career began earlier in the latenineteenth century and continued into the early twentieth centuryencompassing an era with such other Irish baseball stars as WeeWillie Keeler 343 lifetime batting average Eddie Collins 333John J McGraw 333 James Edward Tip ONeill 326 RogerConnor 317 Jim ORourke 310 and Michael King Kelly 308who at his peak led the National League in batting with 354 in 1884and 388 in 18869 Among the Irish pitching stars of that era wasIron Man McGinnity who led the National League in gamespitched in six different seasons was a 35game winner with an earnedrun average of 161 in 1904 and became renowned for sometimespitching both games of a doubleheader10While some might imagine that sports involve only physical skillsit is harder to believe that when it comes to entertainers andespecially musicians and musical composers Here again there hasbeen a fault line between the kinds of entertainment requiring aformal infrastructure of education and training such as ballet andclassical music versus popular music and dance where individualtalents and creativity are key Among musical instruments the violinEpilogue 229  In 1990 17 percent of major league baseball players were black and 13 percentwere Hispanic By 2014 however only 82 percent of major league baseball playerswere black and 284 percent were Hispanic The History of Latinos in AmericasPastime Isnt Black and White The Game We Love The Sporting News and 125Years of Baseball 2015 p 27requires formal training while the piano can

acrossAmerica and even internationally Black composers emerged early inthe twentieth century with Scot Joplin and WC Handy followedlater by a new more sophisticated musical genre created by DukeEllington and othersHere again with entertainment as with sports what blacksachieved was preceded by similar achievements by the Irish beforethem Hispanics after them and by white Southerners A whole line offamous Irish American singers in the early twentieth century wasclimaxed by Bing Crosby as the leading entertainer in the first half ofthe twentieth century and in 1947 he was named Most PopularLiving Person in a radio poll11 It was said that through hisrecordings radio broadcasts and movies his voice was heard by morepeople around the world than the voice of any other human being atthat time Later there were famous Hispanic entertainers and whiteSouthern entertainers went from being regionally prominent to beingnationally famous with Elvis Presley becoming an international iconBillboard magazines 2010 rankings of the Top 100 Artists19552009 had Elvis Presley first with a large lead over The Beatlesin second place12Even within sports there are areas where the skills required forsuccess are clearly and unmistakably not physical These would includebaseball broadcasters whose renown put them in the Baseball Hall ofFame such as Red Barber Mel Allen Russ Hodges and ErnieHarwell all four of whom were from the 1940s and 1950s heyday ofradio sportscasters and all of them white Southerners13 What isespecially remarkable is that these broadcasters became famous in anera when there was not one major league baseball team in the entireSouth To become major league broadcasters they had to move toother regions of the country and compete with people living there inorder to get a job and then to become renowned in their field230 Wealth Poverty and PoliticsDespite the poverty and backwardness of many mountain peopleson every inhabited continent there have been areas in which they tooexcelled A sweeping spectrum of elegant handicrafts have forcenturies poured out of mountain communities around the worldAmong the mountain handicraft products in demand internationallyhave been shawls from Kashmir and watches and clocks fromSwitzerland France and the Black Forest region of southernGermany14 Because of high transportation costs from mountains tothe outside world only articles with a high value concentrated in asmall physical size could find a market in the lowlands and be soldsuccessfully in competition with products produced in the lowlandsAt one time in centuries past villages in the Pindus Mountains ofGreece developed high skills in metalworking and wool processingproducing fine handiwork in gold and silver and exquisitelyembroidered woolens which found markets from Istanbul toVienna Silk handicrafts flourished for a time in the mountains ofGreece Italy and Morocco though these eventually succumbed tocompetition from Asia where silk originated15In the Andes weaving techniques were adapted to the hair of thellamas16 From the mountains of Tibet came many high qualityhandicraft products based on the same social circumstances as in othermountains around the world namely great amounts of free time inthe winters spent indoors where special skills could be developed andpracticed From the deposits of silver and gold in that region Tibetansmade jewelry and from local woods various artistic objects weredesigned and carved In other parts of the world other mountain andhighland peoples also used local resources to produce various localspecialties such as dolls rugs lace and violin strings As a distinguishedgeographer once said Most of these mountain industries merelysupplement the scant agricultural resources they represent the effortsof industrious but hard pressed people to eke out their meagersubsistence17 In the process many became skilled weavers pottersdye makers wood carvers stone carvers and jewelers18Epilogue 231No matter how lagging poor or backward particular peoples maybe at particular times or even for centuries it is hard to find largegroups of human beings so lacking in skills or talents as to be fit onlyto be the proverbial hewers of wood and drawers of water thoughsome welfare state policies and practices have reduced some people toa level where they cannot or will not come up to even that modestlevel of productivityWhile it may be readily understandable that lagging groups canfind some niche in which they can hold their own what is striking isthat such groups often do not merely hold their own but areespecially successful in reaching the peaks more so than thepopulation at large including other groups who greatly outperformthem in many other kinds of endeavors This pattern however seemsconsistent with lagging groups and advanced groups being innatelynot very different if different at all but different primarily in whetherthey have or do not have the full ensemble of factors required forsuccess in various fields even if the lagging group has most of thesefactors but lacks part of the ensemble that comes from either internalculture or external circumstancesIf so then it is not surprising that a backlog as it were of innatepotential unable to come to fruition in other fields would beconcentrated in the fields where the prerequisites are met andtherefore make groups lagging elsewhere be among the topperformers in the fields accessible to them What is also consistentwith this hypothesis is that when groups rise out of the status oflagging groups Irish Americans being a classic example andbecome part of the mainstream of American achievements in a varietyof fields they tend also to forfeit their predominance among the starsin sports and entertainment Against this background many current assumptions and beliefs arehard to sustain One of these current notions is that lagging groupsrequire a lowering of existing standards so that more of theirmembers can advance via various forms of affirmative action Yet thefields in which many lagging minorities have had their greatest232 Wealth Poverty and Politicssuccess especially sports and entertainment are fields notoriousfor severe competition in which even star performers whoseperformances begin to decline are ruthlessly cast aside In shortlagging minorities have flourished in endeavors whose conditions arethe direct opposite of those of affirmative action They have had realachievements against unsparing competition rather than makebelieve achievements based on affirmative action quotasAdvocates of affirmative action who imagine that they can simplytack on whatever factors may be needed for individuals from lagginggroups to succeed usually see this as something that can be done inthe later stages of education at the college or university level when infact it is seldom possible to make up for many years of substandardeducation or ingrained habits with negative consequences On thecontrary affirmative action has too often taken minority studentswith all the prerequisites of success and turned them into artificialfailures by mismatching them with institutions where most membersof the general population would also fail Thus when black studentswere admitted to MIT with mathematics scores at the 90thpercentile this left them in the bottom 10 percent at MIT wherethe other students were at the 99th percentile More than onefifth ofthese black students dropped out while most of those who remainedperformed below the level of their white classmates19In other words black students with qualifications that would havemade them candidates for honors at most colleges and universities wereartificially turned into failures at MIT Conversely when affirmativeaction was banned in the University of California system theproportion of black and Hispanic students who graduated increasedsubstantially as did their grades and their graduation rates inchallenging fields like mathematics science and engineeringAnother popular notion of our time is an expectation of equaleconomic outcomes for groups in the absence of malign treatment byothers Neither more fortunate nor less fortunate groups are randomlydistributed Instead different kinds of groups have very differentpatterns of distribution in different kinds of endeavors In the bitterEpilogue 233battles between those who ascribe different results to external barriersand those who ascribe them to internal deficiencies both often ignorethe possibility that what people want to do or do not want to do is afactor not to be overlooked These culturally shaped preferences canmake the abilityversusbarriers dichotomy irrelevant in particularcases With all the innate ability in the world and with all the doorsof opportunity wide open people who have no desire to do X havevery little likelihood of doing X either well or badlyGiven multiple factors required for success in many endeavorsincluding some in which people with most or perhaps almost all ofthese factors may nevertheless be complete failures there is no reasonto expect either even or random patterns of success Nor is there anybasis for expecting a persistence of a given uneven pattern of successover time especially when the particular prerequisites can changeover time Nor can a general presumption of malign actions by othersbeing behind the fate of the less fortunate be sustained with logicmuch less evidence despite how common that assumption hasbecome in American courts of law under the disparate impacttheory of discrimination or how common that same presumption hasbeen in other nations as wellThe presumption of equal outcomes in the absence of malignactions can lead to incorrect and disastrous conclusions in othercircumstances as well When Dr Marcus Whitman treated bothindigenous American Indians and white Americans for measles in thePacific northwest in 1847 the estimated death rate among theIndians was 50 percent and among the whites was 15 percent at mostOther Indians did not regard this pattern which involved the deathsof their loved ones as just a matter of random chance Blaming theirdeaths on some malign action by Dr Whitman they killed him andhis wife among other whites massacred or enslaved20 However thewhites and the Indians who were ill differed in one crucial factor thegreater exposure of people of European origin to many diseases withwhich the Indians had historically had no contact and therefore haddeveloped no biological resistance234 Wealth Poverty and PoliticsSomething similar sometimes happened in medieval Europe whenepidemics struck When the rate of infection and death wasnoticeably lower among Jews than among Gentiles demagogues wereable to convince some people that Jews must somehow be behind theepidemic and were sparing themselves Where enough peoplebelieved this story it could lead to mass violence against Jews Whatno one knew at the time was that unseen microorganisms were thecause of these epidemics Because Jewish religious practices requiredthem to pray before every meal and since they could not go beforeGod with dirty hands they also had to wash their hands before everymeal Neither Jews nor Gentiles knew about germs at this point buttheir cultural differences had serious consequences in theirsusceptibility to communicable diseasesThese were neither the first nor the last times when statisticaldisparities led people to jump to conclusions about villainy being thecause False assumptions are more than intellectual errors and theirconsequences go far beyond economic lossesGOALSWhile goals are in principle quite different from facts we may allagree on the facts and yet desire to pursue very different goals manygoals are based on a particular set of beliefs about what the existingfacts are If the less fortunate peoples of the world are less fortunateprimarily because they are victims of the more fortunate then the goalto pursue in trying to make things right can be very different fromwhat the goal would be if the less fortunate are seen as people lackingthe geographic cultural and other advantages enjoyed by otherslargely through no fault of theirs or of others Not only may goalsdiffer between people with these very different conceptions of thefacts so may the criteria by which progress is measuredSome might regard the spread of prosperity to human beings ingeneral as the prime criterion of economic success Others especiallyEpilogue 235those who believe that the poor are poor because the rich are gettingrich at their expense may be more likely to see the prime criterion asbeing a reduction or elimination of economic gaps and disparitieswhich are equated with inequities Many people may be in favor ofboth these things and think of them as complementary goals whenin fact beyond some point there are inescapable tradeoffs that canmake the two goals incompatible in practice however desirable theymay seem together in theory If everyones income doubles forexample that will almost certainly reduce poverty but it will alsoincrease economic gaps disparities and inequities Some nationshave in fact had their real per capita income double over varyingperiods of timeObviously some people may value the spread of prosperity morethan the reduction of inequality while others prefer the oppositeWhen China after the death of Mao abandoned the originalCommunist emphasis on economic egalitarianism and adopted moremarketoriented reforms under Deng Xiaoping who said Letsome people get rich first21 the economic growth rate hit newhighs and literally hundreds of millions of people rose out ofpoverty22 That a country historically plagued by famines including afamine under Mao in which tens of millions died became a countryin which about onefourth of the adult population is now overweightis one measure of the change But such marketdriven rises in percapita real income have not been evenly spread in China any morethan in other places and times whether within nations or betweennations When prosperity is widespread even if not equalized that may be ofmore significance to those released from the worst deprivations ofgrinding poverty than would reductions in the statistical gaps betweenthe poor and the rich A lowincome mother whose sick babys chancesof dying in infancy have been cut in half as a result of rising prosperityis unlikely to think of this as inconsequential much less a grievanceeven if she learns that a rich mothers babys smaller chances of dying ininfancy have also been cut in half or by more than half 236 Wealth Poverty and PoliticsPreoccupation with disparities gaps and inequities has largelybeen the hallmark of the intelligentsia the media and politicians Yetthe people whose lives have been most changed by rising levels ofprosperity around the world have often been those who were mostlacking in basic things before Thus even a redistributionist has notedthat the population growth in lowincome countries has increased ata higher rate than in more affluent countries23 This has largely beendue to growing economic prosperity and advances in medicalknowledge originating in more affluent countriesIf the desperately poor people in the Italian mountain villagedescribed by Edward C Banfield in the midtwentieth century werelater enabled to add some meat to their diet even if onlyhamburgers or frankfurters that might be a more meaningfulbenefit to them than if people in a more affluent society could affordmore steak or lobster Being able to afford motor scooters might addmore to the range of the mountain villagers mobility than if a richfamily bought a second Rolls Royce In their book Free to ChooseRose and Milton Friedman pointed out such patterns more generallyIndustrial progress mechanical improvement all of the great wondersof the modern era have meant relatively little to the wealthy The rich inAncient Greece would have benefited hardly at all from modernplumbing running servants replaced running water Television andradio the patricians of Rome could enjoy the leading musicians andactors in their home could have the leading artists as domestic retainersReadytowear clothing supermarkets all these and many othermodern developments would have added little to their life They wouldhave welcomed the improvements in transportation and in medicine butfor the rest the great achievements of Western capitalism haveredounded primarily to the benefit of the ordinary person24Epilogue 237  On a personal note at a dire time in my life as a young man I pawned my onesuit in order to get money to be able to eat After emerging from a pawn shop onthe Lower East Side of New York which was a predominantly Jewishneighborhood at that time I went into a nearby eating place and ordered a knishand an orange soda Many years later I would eat at the Waldorf Astoria in Parisianrestaurants and in the White House  But no meal ever topped that knish andorange sodaBack in 1836 Nathan Rothschild one of the richest men in theworld and perhaps the richest died from an infection that defiedthe efforts of leading doctors summoned to his side25 Today thepoorest child of a welfare mother in America is unlikely to die fromthat same infection because economic and medical advances presentroutine cures for such things This happened not becausegovernments intervened to prevent people from becoming as rich asNathan Rothschild but because people in some countries remainedfree to work out their own lives and make their own mutualaccommodations on such terms as they could with their fellow humanbeings and it was largely from such countries that the technologicaland medical advances cameEmphasis on income distribution and especiallyredistribution to the neglect of production downplays the benefits tosociety at large and to the poor especially from what is produced inthe course of earning higher incomes As new better and oftencheaper products spread throughout societies around the world muchof this output benefits people of all sorts which is the very reason whymillions of people are willing to pay for it and thus create fortunessuch as that of Bill Gates and othersSince the reduction of poverty and the closing of economic gapsare competing goals on what basis can we choose between them Onebasis might be what is actually achievable and at what cost There is aserious question as to whether economic equality even approximateequality can be achieved at all since economic achievementsdepend on things largely beyond any governments control such asgeography or totally beyond anyones control such as the past Thatdoes not mean that we can do nothing but it does suggest that wecannot do everything that strikes us as desirableEven leaving aside all practical issues arising from conflicts betweenthe goal of increasing prosperity and the goal of reducing gaps the238 Wealth Poverty and Politics  It is not that money income trickles down to the poor a proposition advocatedby no one but used as a straw man by many See my monograph TrickleDownTheory and Tax Cuts for the Richachievement of equal incomes can be literally impossible when equalityin one sense is inherently incompatible with equality in another senseTo take the most extreme case even if every American manwoman and child had equal individual incomes that would still leavesubstantial inequalities in household incomes because households thatare in the top 20 percent of income recipients today contain millionsmore people than households in the bottom 20 percent Suchhouseholds would remain in higher income brackets if incomes weremade equal among all individuals If we restrict income equality toadults there would be even more inequality between householdssince households consisting of a single mother with multiple childrenwould not have as much income per person as households consistingof two parents and their children even if welfare paid the singlemother as much as other adults received for working Putting aside the case of literal equality between every individualor every individual adult if by some miracle it were possible to haveall individuals in all groups attain both the same quantitative levels ofeducation as measured by number of years in school and also thesame qualitative levels as measured by mastery of subjects of the samedifficulty and economic rewards that would still leave intractabledifferences in age which would mean inescapable differences inexperience since when the age of adulthood is eighteen a fortyyearold worker has more than ten times as much work experience as atwentyyearold workerIn these circumstances even if every twentyyearold Puerto Ricanin the United States had identical incomes with every twentyyearold Japanese American and similar equality at every other age thatwould still leave a major income inequality between these two groupssince the average Japanese American is more than twenty years olderthan the average Puerto Rican In short even extraordinary andunprecedented equalizations among individuals could still leave majorstatistical inequalities among groups This raises a crucial questionWhat are the consequences of choosing and fervently proclaiming anunreachable goal Epilogue 239Theoretically everyone could get together and agree on whichparticular definition of equality they would use so that it would thenat least be possible to have equality But what incentive would there beto do that in an atmosphere where every disparity or gap is seen as anintolerable grievance redeemable by various benefits to be supplied byothers Whatever the merits of any particular definition of equality ofoutcomes what must be faced are the consequences of perpetuallypromoting a fervent crusade perpetually frustrated by its own internalcontradictions but whose frustration is instead blamed on somehuman enemies of a sacred cause Those who are in the business of protesting grievances are notgoing to stop protesting or taking disruptive or violent actionbecause equality has been achieved by one definition when equalityby one definition precludes equality by some other definitions In thiscontext such phrases as No justice no peace are a declaration ofunending internal strife since justice by one definition is injustice byanother But no society has inexhaustible patience with unendingturmoil If history is any guide it is only a matter of time beforepatience is exhausted and severe repressive measures are imposed tothe ultimate detriment of the whole society Again if history is any guide no amount of progress toward anunreachable goal can satisfy fiercely promoted aspirations seen assacred so that all remaining unfulfilled hopes are seen as intolerableimpositions of injustice Some have argued from history that majorsocial upheavals have often occurred when social problems were infact lessening but not at a pace comparable to rising expectations Ifso it may be more than coincidence that the wave of ghetto riots thatswept across the United States in the 1960s began just days afterpassage of the Voting Rights Act of 1965 the capstone of historic civilrights legislation that had preceded Preoccupation with income differences and with political crusadesagainst them have not seized the minds and emotions of the generalpublic to anything like the degree to which such preoccupations havedominated the thinking of the intelligentsia The obsession of the240 Wealth Poverty and Politicsintelligentsia with economic gaps and disparities has not usuallybeen shared by the public at large This has been true even in many countries with the mostpoisonous form of this obsession resentment and hatred of ethnicminorities who are more productive and therefore more prosperousthan the population at large A scholarly study of Romania betweenthe two World Wars for example found that the antiJewish moodproved most rampant among the middle and upper classes and amongthe intellectuals26 It was much the same story of hostile reactions toother minority businessmen and professionals in other countriesaround the world An international treatise on ethnic conflicts found that thesupposed economic resentments of businessmen by their customersoften do not exist27 Malays often preferred dealing with Chineseshopkeepers for example28 Maharashtrians preferred shopping atbusinesses run by nonMaharashtrians in Bombay now Mumbai inthe late twentieth century29 In Indonesia and Burma indigenousfarmers often preferred dealing with Arab moneylenders inIndonesia and Indian moneylenders in Burma to dealing withgovernment moneylenders of their own ethnicity even though thelatter offered lower interest rates30 Boycotts of Indian businesses inUganda in 19591960 and of Japanese businesses in Peru in 1930lacked public support31 But such boycotts and other actions againstminority businesses have been supported by indigenous business rivalsin these and other countries as an obvious matter of selfinterestsand by the respective intelligentsia on ideological grounds African university students have been hostile toward Indianbusinessmen in Uganda Lebanese businessmen in Nigeria Ghanaand Senegal Armenian businessmen in Ethiopia32 The Third Worldintelligentsia have seldom had any business experience and greatlyprefer government jobs to working in the private sector33 Similarhostility to business has long been common among intellectuals inmore prosperous industrial societies as well It is not surprising thatthe goal of reducing economic inequalities has often permeated theirEpilogue 241advocacies and actions With sufficient time persistence and fervorthe obsessions of the intelligentsia can of course spread to the publicat large but that is seldom where such zeal originatesMore generally the crucial question in economic and social issuesis whether the success of whatever goal is being pursued is measuredby its tangible effects on human happiness or unhappiness or isinstead measured by abstract numbers or other indicators ofapproaching a preconceived tableau Despite all the horrors undertotalitarian Communist governments in the twentieth century itshould not be forgotten that the Communist movements which led tosuch governments included people dedicated to equality to endingexploitation and to other humane goals Many in such movementswere willing to risk or sacrifice their livelihoods or if necessary theirlives in pursuit of these goals The willingness of many to alsosacrifice their own integrity and the truth in order to forward thecause was a key factor in the political success of ruthless Communistleaders in imposing horrors with impunity This was not unique to Communist movements Similar phenomenahave existed in smaller messianic movements such as that which led tothe Jonestown massacre in 1978 But the Communist movement wasthe largest and most thoroughly documented example of a movementsimplacable pursuit of an unachievable ideal and the demonizing of allwho got in the way while lionizing ruthless leaders with unbridledpowers including the power to make a mockery of the ideals of themovement itself and exterminate any of its members he chose Communists are of course an extreme example But under anymovement or set of collective beliefs being on the side of the angelscan be a dangerous selfindulgence in a heedless willfulnesssometimes called idealism This kind of idealism can seduce thinkinginto feeling replace realities with preconceptions and make the overriding goal the victory of some abstract vision in defiance of reality orin disregard of the truth and the fate of fellow human beings 242 Wealth Poverty and PoliticsACKNOWLEDGEMENTSOne of the most general acknowledgements that needs to be mademore often than it is is that we all stand on the shoulders of giants Iam especially awed and indebted to those who have obviouslyinvested great amounts of time and wisdom writing monumentaltreatises from The Chinese in Southeast Asia by Victor Purcell toHuman Accomplishment by Charles Murray America in Black andWhite by Stephan Thernstrom and Abigail Thernstrom Influences ofGeographic Environment by Ellen Churchill Semple Ethnic Groups inConflict by Donald L Horowitz and a whole series of insightful andenlightening scholarly books on Europes history and geography byNJG PoundsOther books more notable for their very high quality than for theirphysical size would include Life at the Bottom by TheodoreDalrymple Charles A Prices Southern Europeans in Australia andDavid S Landes The Wealth and Poverty of Nations No doubt theinfirmities of memory mean that this brief list leaves out some equallyworthy works among the hundreds of other publications consultedandor cited in this book But the list is offered as suggestive ratherthan definitiveThere would of course be no point standing on the shoulders ofthese and other giants if we saw only what they saw and simplyrepeated what they had already said often quite well But we can atleast look in different directions from the vantage point they give us Then there are the many wrongheaded publications includingspecious Supreme Court decisions which have spurred myexamination of issues that I might not have noticed otherwise  Butthe authors of these wrongheaded notions might not fully appreciatemy expressions of gratitude to them by name in this context243Closer to home it would be hard to exaggerate how much I owe tomy research assistants of many years Na Liu and Elizabeth CostaThey have not simply gotten research material that I asked for buthave participated more actively by seeking out and evaluating othermaterial on their own initiative In addition Ms Costa has done thepainstaking copyediting and factchecking while Ms Liu hascreated the Quark computer files from which the finished manuscriptcan be printed directly into books All of this takes place with the support and under the auspices ofthe Hoover Institution utilizing the vast library resources of StanfordUniversity My wife Mary and my friend of many years JosephCharney both gave critiques of the original version of Chapter 1 thatcaused it to be drastically revised and improvedAll conclusions and whatever errors there may be are solely

Income in the United States 2000Current Population Reports P60213 Washington US Bureau of theCensus 2001 p 216 The phrase income distribution leads some people to reason as if there is somepreexisting block of income or wealth created somehow that is thendivided up among individuals or groups In reality it is the process of creatingwealth that leads to individual incomes being received in exchange for individualproductivity in that process These individual incomes may later be added up byothers into a verbally collectivized national income which is then spoken of asbeing distributed to individuals or groups Sometimes the same way of thinkingis applied internationally leading to laments about such things as howAmericans for example consume a disproportionate share of the worldsoutput But there is no one named World who produces all output or indeedany output at all Americans essentially consume what Americans produce usinga portion of what they produce to exchange for an equivalent amount of importedgoods from others In a purely figurative statistical sense income can be said tobe distributed in the same sense in which there is a statistical distribution ofheights in a population without anyone imagining that these heights existcollectively and are then sent out to individuals Those who believe that incomeor wealth should be collectivized in reality and then be shared out are of coursefree to advocate such an economic system explicitly but that is very different frominsinuating such a process with words that have more than one meaning17 Henry Hazlitt The

Ive become I hope you enjoy this archived transcript and I ask that you respect my wishes to close this chapter of my online lifeThanks and all my loveNatalie WynnFour months ago before I became the plucky though dipsomaniacal crossdresser you know and love I was an adjunct philosophy professor at a major research university which I dont know whether Archives Why I Quit

guess its always best to laugh in these situations because crying makes you look like a sissy boy and frankly I find that kind of thing disgustingIn this video Im gonna recount my rise from grace or how this became hotter than this These are their storiesI mentioned in my last video that in college I studied neuroscience Well I actually worked as a research assistant in couple labs and thats when I realized that on a daytoday basis neuroscience is less about unlocking the secrets of consciousness than it is about collecting volumes of fMRI images of brains of people looking at pictures of faces while tasting something good versus tasting human shit and then using soontobediscredited statistical methods to analyze those imagesI dont know maybe that is how you unlock the secrets of consciousness but I got pretty bored with it at the timeSo I added a second major in philosophy thinking that was guaranteed to be more exciting I mean it was advertised as a quest for truth beauty and justice Oh the folly of youthI guess what I liked about philosophy as an undergrad was that you get go on this multimillennial drivethru of ideas reading Plato one week then Kant then Foucault It was like a guided tour of European historys most boring homosexualsSo I graduated and put my philosophy degree to use at a job as a Segway tour guide before realizing that I was unequipped to deal with the private sector they expect resultsSo I applied to philosophy PhD programs and got accepted at a pretty good one And for the next two years I lived like a goddamn

when you advance to the graduate level youre expected to focus In philosophy that means choosing a specialty and eventually a research topic which youll spend several years writing a dissertation aboutBecause there are hundreds of other people writing dissertations in the field and youre expected to contribute something original you end up having to narrow in on a research topic thats really specialized So specialized in fact that it strains the human ability to give a shitLets take a look at some recent philosophy dissertation topics Weve gotPaul Ricoeurs Hermeneutic Ontology Between Aristotle and KantA Gadamerian Analysis of Roman Catholic Hermeneutics A Diachronic Analysis of Interpretations of Romans 117217The Paradox of Nature MerleauPontys SemiNaturalistic Critique of

pieces of writing despite having inaccessible jargonladen titlesBut you see the point Im trying to make The philosopher Daniel Dennett said that much of academic philosophy amounts to discovering higherorder truths about chmess chmess being a variant on chess that nobody actually playsI think theres a certain personality type that enjoys difficult intellectual problems for their own sake and if thats you academia might be a perfectly good place for you But its not for meThe worst for me were conferences where youd have to listen to twelve straight hours of mindnumbing inconsequential scholastic jabbering and then go to dinner to talk about it all over again I used to just skip dinner and drink a pint of bourbon alone in my hotel room and spy on people in the courtyard pool because goddamn I needed to feel something Im honestly surprised my health survived these years of my life Fortunately I have this naturally gracile body thats easy to maintainborderline bulimia jokesP a r t  I I   p o l i t i c a l  r e a s o n sRightwing dingdongs like to paint academia as some sort of leftist madrasa where Marxist feminism is the only permissible worldview This is an exaggeration but its not that much of an exaggerationI was once in an advanced political philosophy seminar with a bunch of other grad students and the reading we were to discuss that week was the libertarian philosopher Robert Nozicks book Anarchy State and Utopia None of us in this seminar were able to mount any plausible arguments against Nozick not because hes correct but because we had so little experience arguing against anything that far right Everyone in this room was a reasonably httpsaardvarklilyk2lzsquarespacecom7192020 Archived Transcript of Why I Quite Academia

Rawls and Habermas and we had no experience arguing against anything as far right as the political views that most Americans actually holdNow maybe its okay to focus on these little quibbles and not get bogged down with defending the basics of your worldview but I personally find that boring I dont give a damn about the petty infighting between French neoMarxists and Italian neoMarxists I want to see the critical theory people debate the libertarians Now thats a conference Id fucking pay to go to But that kind of thing doesnt happen very much in academia You have to go to YouTube for the real entertainment and also frankly for the real debateTheres also a certain amount of genuine leftist bullshit passing itself off as scholarship I was once in a comparative literature seminar that I foolishly took in the hopes of getting to read something written with a decent prose style or at least something by an emotionally competent human being Boy was I disappointed when on the first day the professor made two allusions to my good friend Derrida Those are quotation marks around my good friend because he mentioned that Derrida was his friend every time it came up Pass the cyanide honeyAnyway the low point of this guys endless beginningless argumentfree impromptu lectures came when he baldly asserted that the poetry of Milton had a direct influence on the workings of ISIS Yes this would be John Milton the 17th century English poet and ISIS the contemporary Syrian terrorist organization And what evidence did the professor adduce in support of this outrageous claim None whatsofuckingever And the other grad students in the room just sat there nodding knowingly taking notes like a bunch of sycophants No one raised their hand no one said Excuse me professor but what in Jesus name are you fucking talking about I didnt even say anything I had no spinehttpsaardvarklilyk2lzsquarespacecom7192020 Archived Transcript of Why I Quite Academia  ContraPointshttpsaardvarklilyk2lzsquarespacecomtranscriptsarchivesquitacademia 68The only explanation I can think of for this was that the professor had this reflexive hatred of himself of English literature of basically all of Western culture and so he had to hallucinate that Islamic terrorism is in some way the outcome of overzealously reading Paradise LostI guess this is what being good friends with Derrida does to youAnd can someone remind me again how studying this shit is helpful to the working class Oh thats right it isnt its just a bunch of uppermiddleclass white people discovering higher order truths about chmessNow I mightve been able to put up with all this if Id been sure that there was a stable career ahead of me But there was no such thing Universities take on more grad students than there are academic jobs and tenuretrack positions are rapidly disappearing with temporary adjunct positions taking their place Now if you have a PhD in physics or economics you can always go into the private sector But in philosophy there is no private sector No one is expecting results There are no resultsPure love is the only justification for doing it and I didnt love itSo I realized that I couldnt live with myself if I continued on I finished my masters coursework and I quit There was an unexpected coda to my academic career last spring when an old professor of mine got sick and I was hired to teach his class for him So I did get to taste absolute power once but now that thats over Im outOver the last year Ive been employed as a legal assistant an Uber
