 know The important thing is that we never stop debating  Archives TERFs  httpswwwcontrapointscom   7192020 Archived Transcript of TERFs  ContraPoints  httpswwwcontrapointscomtranscriptsarchivesterfs 210  Tonight well be debating the question are trans women women   My first guest is Tiffany Tumbles host of the popular YouTube series   Trans Tips with Tiffany Clarence could we role a clip  Hey fam welcome to trans tips with Tiffany with new feminization   secrets every week to help you unlock your inner woman This week   Ill be demonstrating how women eat barbecued ribs   So you have your rack of ribs and what men will do is they hold   the rib like this and they just dig right in Now some guys like it if you   do that they like a girl whos a little bit messy But if you want to   appear more feminine what you should do is just kind ofroar   utter chaos smashing eating smearing bbq sauce Fuck Shit its   so good Motherfucker crying etc  JACKIE Wow truly inspiring My other guest tonight is Abigail  Cockbane feminist activist and author of The Trans Menace   Lesbian Genocide and the Rape of Feminism So tell me Abigail   are trans women really women  ABIGAIL If by trans women you mean men who put on lipstick and  invade womens spaces then no men are not women  JACKIE Ok And Tiffany what do you say to that  TIFFANY Um do I really have to respond to that  JACKIE Well yes Yes you do Youre here to debate arent you  The debate must commence Tiffany the debate must commence  TIFFANY Well I am a woman I live my life as a woman I wake  up as a woman I make love as a woman I experience sexism as a   woman Im treated like a woman in public   ABIGAIL No no no no no no Females are oppressed under  patriarchy because men want control of our wombs Males   httpswwwcontrapointscom   7192020 Archived Transcript of TERFs  ContraPoints  httpswwwcontrapointscomtranscriptsarchivesterfs 310  impersonating women dont have wombs and they cannot be   oppressed on that basis  TIFFANY Well what about infertile cis women men dont want to  control their wombs but they still experience sexism dont they  ABIGAIL Yes because being female means youre assumed to  have female reproductive function Men do not try to control the   reproductive function of other men pretending to be women  TIFFANY I am not a man pretending to be a woman When men  catcall trans women when they rape us when they harass us when   they deny us employment they dont care that we dont have   wombs they only care that were women  ABIGAIL Well does any of that even happen I mean I for one can  always tell the difference between a real woman and a man in a   wig and Im pretty sure so can men  TIFFANY Well you would know that it happens all the time if you  were willing to listen to the experiences of trans women but youre   not willing to do that because you are a TERF  sting  ABIGAIL What did you just call me  JACKIE Yeah what does that mean  TIFFANY A TERF A transexclusionary radical feminist  ABIGAIL That is a vicious antifemale slur  TIFFANY You know its really not Its just a fact that thats what  you are If anything its too generous because theres nothing   radical or feminist about your view  sting  httpswwwcontrapointscom   7192020 Archived Transcript of TERFs  ContraPoints  httpswwwcontrapointscomtranscriptsarchivesterfs 410  ABIGAIL What  TIFFANY Youre a bad feminist  ABIGAIL What did you say  JACKIE Aw yeah this is a hot exchange of ideas Keep it going  girls  TIFFANY Youre a bad feminist This is just reactionary gender  essentialism with a radical veneer  ABIGAIL How dare you say that Ill teach you a thing or two  about gender essentialism Gender essentialism is the idea that   wearing high heels and a miniskirt makes you a woman  TIFFANY I never wear high heels or miniskirts why do you think  trans women do this  ABIGAIL Well Caitlyn Jenner  TIFFANY Not all trans women are Caitlyn Jenner A lot of trans  women are very feminine because we have to be in order for   society to recognize us as women But makeup and long hair are not   what makes us women thats just one way of communicating a truth   that comes from within  ABIGAIL Right so any hairy man who decides he feels like a  woman one day can strut around naked in a womens locker room   with his genitals flopping around and women who have been   abused by men are expected to just allow that in their safe space  TIFFANY Why is it always hairy and flopping genitals Trans  women as a group are the most devoted body hair removers Ive   ever met Theyre also some of the least likely to flop their genitals in   public   httpswwwcontrapointscom   7192020 Archived Transcript of TERFs  ContraPoints  httpswwwcontrapointscomtranscriptsarchivesterfs 510  ABIGAIL That doesnt matter To a woman who has been abused  the sight of male genitals is still triggering  JACKIE Wouldnt a sexual assailants genitals be hard instead of  flopping  TIFFANY I dont know but thats not the point Trans women are  not hairy men who decide to wave their genitals at women This is   just a scenario youve made up to scare people into thinking trans   women are really just predatory men  ABIGAIL Im not making it up It happens all the time I can send  you at least a dozen Daily Mail articles about it  TIFFANY Oh the Daily Mail that radical feminist publication we  all love so much  JACKIE Im sorry can I interrupt here It seems like the  disagreement in this exchange is about what it means to be a   woman Abigail it seems like the idea youre bringing to the   marketplace is that women are people with vaginas and Tiffany   youre trying to sell us on the idea that a woman is someone who   fills the social role of a woman is that right  TIFFANY Well not exactly I mean you can radically reject  conventional social roles while still being a woman This is why I   emphasize psychology what matters is that you feel at ease with   female embodiment and ill at ease with male embodiment  ABIGAIL Well Im not at ease with female embodiment  TIFFANY Well would you rather be in a mans body  ABIGAIL Ew no The problem isnt my body and Im not going  mutilate my body because Im not delusional like you The problem   is the gendered assumptions that society projects onto female   bodies If we abolish gender well also abolish gender dysphoria  httpswwwcontrapointscom   7192020 Archived Transcript of TERFs  ContraPoints  httpswwwcontrapointscomtranscriptsarchivesterfs 610  TIFFANY But gender dysphoria isnt just dissatisfaction with  gendered associations I dont like my body being viewed as a   passive object anymore than you do but that doesnt mean Im not   dysphoric about my male characteristics or that I dont prefer   inhabiting a female body  ABIGAIL But this preference for a female body is nonsense You  are a male who wants to occupy a female body like a parasite but   you cant so you take pills that make you grow pectoral tissue and   you paint your face like a parody of exploited womanhood and   even if you do decide to mutilate your genitals youll still have big   hands and wide shoulders and youll tower over females like a   monster   Society needs to stop enabling these ridiculous delusions right now   and instead help you to get over the fact that no amount of surgery   and makeup can make you into a woman  O magnum mysterium  TIFFANY in deep pain  JACKIE slow applaud That was some good free speech right  there at cam I totally just came  TIFFANY Well hold on arent you the one defining womanhood  with stereotypes If wearing high heels doesnt make you a woman   why does having small hands  ABIGAIL Because small hands are a result of the same biological  features that engender the female reproductive role for which   womenfemalesare oppressed under patriarchy  TIFFANY Well even if reproductive control is the original reason  patriarchy oppresses women reproductive capacity is not the   criterion society uses when it comes to treating people like women   or men  httpswwwcontrapointscom   7192020 Archived Transcript of TERFs  ContraPoints  httpswwwcontrapointscomtranscriptsarchivesterfs 710  ABIGAIL You think because you identify as a woman society  identifies you as one but youre wrong You cant just argue from   your feelings  TIFFANY If you were a good feminist then maybe youd be willing  to believe womens accounts of their own experiences but since you   arent we can rely on data trans women experience domestic   violence and employment discrimination at rates even higher than   cis women and are less likely to get victim assistance  ABIGAIL Well even if trans survey data is to be trusted being a  victim still isnt what makes you a woman  TIFFANY But you said that having a womb is the reason women  are oppressed which in many cases is demonstrably false  ABIGAIL Just because some men are victims of sexual violence  doesnt mean that theyre women  TIFFANY But if they feel like women live like women and  experience misogyny like women why is having a womb still more   important  ABIGAIL Because thats the original reason women are oppressed  in the first place  TIFFANY Even if thats true its not always the reason women are  oppressed now What reason could you have to insist on this apart   from pure transphobic prejudice  ABIGAIL The reason is that words have to mean something I have  a definition of womanhood that makes sense and that everyone can   understand And you want to tell me that anyone who says theyre a   woman is a woman but that kind of postmodern nonsense makes it   impossible to politically organize as women and as feminists which   leads to men taking over womens movements and womens spaces  httpswwwcontrapointscom   7192020 Archived Transcript of TERFs  ContraPoints  httpswwwcontrapointscomtranscriptsarchivesterfs 810  TIFFANY Your assumption is still that transwomen are lying men  pretending to be women for what purpose to enjoy being   potentially rejected by their families evicted from their homes   abused by the police and raped in prison Why cant you believe   that other people are radically unhappy with their assigned gender   or sex  ABIGAIL Because one minute youre telling me severe mental  illness is what makes someone transgender and the next youll be   asking me to accept that not all trans people transition and that   women with short hair are actually a third gender This is   counterrevolutionary individualist nonsense that puts personal   feelings over political structures  TIFFANY Im not denying political structures Im telling you that  individual people interact with those structures in complex ways that   dont always correspond to whether or not they have a womb  ABIGAIL Well give me a coherent definition of gender identity that  doesnt fall apart on examination then maybe Ill be willing to   reconsider  JACKIE drunk Yeah Tiffany can you explain gender identity I  dont get it  TIFFANY Well if youre expecting some ultimate definition that  perfectly accounts for everyone youll never be satisfied But Abigail   has no room to talk She just defined women as people with wombs   Well what about women who have hysterectomies  ABIGAIL They still have XX chromosomes  TIFFANY Well what about women with Swyer syndrome who  have a uterus but XY chromosomes  ABIGAIL Thats an aberration  httpswwwcontrapointscom   7192020 Archived Transcript of TERFs  ContraPoints  httpswwwcontrapointscomtranscriptsarchivesterfs 910  TIFFANY Well goddamn it Abigail every definition is perfect if you  ignore everything that doesnt fit the definition And if this shitty   argument is the only reason you can come up with to totally   disregard the lived experiences of thousands of trans women well   its hard for me to believe thats anything but bigotry  JACKIE drunk well honey I dont know if we need to be accusing  anyone of bigotry but Abigail if youre so smart then how do you   know that shes not a woman  long silence awkward editing  ABIGAIL Palpatine voice Dost thou bleed  TIFFANY What  ABIGAIL Dost thou bleed slams fist  DostThouBleed  TIFFANY I do not menstruate out of my dick if thats what youre  asking  ABIGAIL Infiltrator Never canst thou enter the sisterhood of the  blood  TIFFANY Good I just want to pee I dont want to be part of your  creepy vagina cult  ABIGAIL Oh and now vaginas are creepy This is exactly the kind  of antifemale sentiment Ive come to expect from male feminists   Jackie I weary of this toilsome man Shall we perform the ritual of   the blood  JACKIE Oh is it that time already Yeah yeah sure Lets do it  Sits at piano plays Moonlight Sonata  httpswwwcontrapointscom   7192020 Archived Transcript of TERFs  ContraPoints

know that Farewell thou who dost not bleed  Abigail walks to bathroom strips to nightgown gets in bath bleeds   in bath  full moon wolves howling Tiffany confused  TIFFANY Okay well Im going to leave

DEAR FELLOW CLERGYMEN  While confined here in the Birmingham city jail I came  across your recent statement calling my present activities  unwise and untim ely Seldom do I pause to answer criti cism o f my work and ideas If I sought to answer all  the criticisms that cross my desk m y secretaries would  have litde time for anything other than such correspond ence in the course of the day and I would have no time  for constructive w ork But since I feel that you are men  of genuine good will and that your criticisms are sin cerely set forth I want to try to answer your statement  in what I hope will be patient and reasonable terms  I think I should indicate why I am here in Birming ham since you have been influenced by the view which  argues against outsiders coming in I have the honor o f  serving as president of the Southern Christian Leader ship Conference an organization operating in every    Southern state with headquarters in Atlanta Georgia  We have some eightyfive affiliated organizations across  the South and one o f them is the Alabama Christian  Movement for Human Rights Frequently we share staff  educational and financial resources with our affiliates  Several months ago the affiliate here in Birmingham  asked us to be on call to engage in a nonviolent direct  actionprogram if such were deemed necessary We read ily consented and when the hour came we lived up to  our promise Sol   along with several members o f my  staff am here because I was invited here I am here  because I have organizational ties here  But more basically I am in Birmingham because injus tice is here Just as the prophets o f the eighth century  BC left their villages and carried their thus saith the  Lord far beyond the boundaries o f their home towns  and just as the Apostle Paul left his village o f Tarsus and  carried the gospel o f Jesus Christ to the far comers of  the Greco Roman world so am I compelled to carry the  gospel o f freedom beyond my own home town Like  Paul I must constantly respond to the Macedonian call  for aid  Moreover I am cognizant o f the interrelatedness of  all communities and states I cannot sit idly by in Atlanta  and not be concerned about what happens in Birming ham Injustice anywhere is a threat to justice everywhere  marx  marx  marx    We are caught in an inescapable network o f mutuality  tied in a single garment of destiny Whatever affects one  directly affects all indirectly Never again can we afford  to live with the narrow provincial outside agitator idea  Anyone who lives inside the United States can never be  considered an outsider anywhere within its bounds  You deplore the demonstrations taking place in Bir mingham But your statement I am sorry to say fails to  express a similar concern for the conditions that brought  about the demonstrations I am sure that none of you  would want to rest content with the superficial kind o f  social analysis that deals merely with effects and does not  grapple with underlying causes It is unfortunate that  demonstrations are taking place in Birmingham but it is  evenmore unfortunate that the citys whitepower struc ture left the Negro community with no alternative  In any nonviolent campaign there are four basic steps  collection o f the facts to determine whether injustices  exist negotiation selfpurification and direct action We  have gone through all these steps in Birmingham There  can be no gainsaying the fact that racial injustice engulfs  this community Birmingham is probably the most thor oughly segregated city in the United States Its ugly  record o f brutality is widely known Negroes have expe rienced grossly unjust treatment in the courts There  have been more unsolved bombings of Negro homes  marx  marx  marx    and churches in Birmingham than in any other city in  the nation These are the hard brutal facts of the case  On the basis o f these conditions Negro leaders sought  to negotiate with the city fathers But the latter consist ently refused to engage in good faith negotiation  Then last September came the opportunity to talk  with leaders o f Birminghams economic community In  the course o f the negotiations certain promises were  made by the merchants   for example to remove the  stores humiliating racial signs On the basis o f these  promises the Reverend Fred Shuttlesworth and the lead ers o f the Alabama Christian Movement for Human  Rights agreed to a moratorium on all demonstrations  As the weeks and months went by we realized that we  were the victims o f a broken promise A few signs  briefly removed returned the others remained As in  so many past experiences our hopes had been blasted  and the shadow of deep disappointment settled upon  us We had no alternative except to prepare for direct  action whereby we would present our very bodies as a  means o f laying our case before the conscience o f the  local and the national community Mindful o f the diffi culties involved we decided to undertake a process o f  selfpurification We began a series o f workshops on  nonviolence and we repeatedly asked ourselves Are  you able to accept blows without retaliating Are you  marx    able to endure the ordeal of jail We decided to schedule  our direct action program for the Easter season realizing  that except for Christmas this is the main shopping  period o f the year Knowing that a strong economic  withdrawal program would be the byproduct of direct  action we felt that this would be the best time to bring  pressure to bear on the merchants for the needed change  Then it occurred to us that Birminghams mayoral  election was coming up in March and we speedily  decided to postpone actionuntil after election day When  we discovered that the Commissioner of Public Safety  Eugene Bull Connor had piled up enough votes to be  in the run off we decided again to postpone action until  the day after the run off so that the demonstrations  could not be used to cloud the issues Like many others  we waited to see Mr Connor defeated and to this end  we endured postponement after postponement Having  aided in this community need we felt that our direct  action program could be delayed no longer  You may well ask W hy direct action W hy sitins  marches and so forth Isnt negotiation a better path  You are quite right in calling for negotiation Indeed this  is the very purpose o f direct action Nonviolent direct  action seeks to create such a crisis and foster such a ten sion that a community which has constantly  refused to  negotiate is forced to confront the issue It seeks so to  marx  marx    dramatize the issue that it can no longer be ignored My  citing the creation of tension as part o f the work o f the  nonviolent resister may sound rather shocking But I  must confess that I am not afraid o f the word tension  I have earnestly opposed violent tension but there is a  type o f constructive nonviolent tension which is neces sary for growth Just as Socrates felt that it was necessary  to create a tension in the mind so that individuals could  rise from the bondage o f myths and halftruths to the  unfettered realm o f creative analysis and objective  appraisal so must we see the need for nonviolent gad flies to create the kind of tension in society that will help  men rise from the dark depths o f prejudice and racism  to the majestic heights o f understanding and brother hood The purpose o f our direct action program is to  create a situation so crisispacked that it will inevitably  open the door to negotiation I therefore concur with  you in your call for negotiation Too long has our beloved  Southland been bogged down in a tragic effort to live in  monologue rather than dialogue  One of the basic points in your statement is that the  action that I and my associates have taken in Birmingham  is untimely Some have asked W hy didnt you give the  new city administration time to act The only answer  that I can give to this query is that the new Birmingham  administration must be prodded about as much as the  marx  marx  marx    outgoing one before it will act We are sadly mistaken if  we feel that the election o f Albert Boutwell as mayor will  bring the millennium to Birmingham While Mr Bout  well is a much more gentle person than Mr Connor they  are both segregationists dedicated to maintenance o f the  status quo I have hope that Mr Boutwell will be reason able enough to see the futility o f massive resistance to  desegregation But he will not see this without pressure  from devotees of civil rights My friends I must say to  you that we have not made a single gain in civil rights  without determined legal and nonviolent pressure Lam entably it is an historical fact that privileged groups  seldom give up their privileges voluntarily Individuals  may see the moral light and voluntarily give up their  unjust posture but as Reinhold Niebuhr has reminded  us groups tend to be more immoral than individuals  We know through painful experience that freedom is  never voluntarily given by the oppressor it must be  demanded by the oppressed Frankly I have yet to engage  in a direct action campaign that was well timed in the  view of those who have not suffered unduly from the dis ease of segregation For years now I have heard the word  Wait It rings in the ear o f every Negro with piercing  familiarity This Wait has almost always meant Never  We must come to see with one o f our distinguished  jurists that justice too long delayed is justice denied  marx  marx  marx    We have waited for more than 340 years for our con stitutional and Godgiven rights The nations of Asia and  Africa are moving with jetlike speed toward gaining  political independence but we still creep at horse and  buggy pace toward gaining a cup o f coffee at a lunch  counter Perhaps it is easy for those who have never felt  the slinging darts of segregation to say Wait But when  you have seen vicious mobs lynch your mothers and  fathers at will and drown your sisters and brothers at  whim when you have seen hatefilled policemen curse  kick and even kill your black brothers and sisters when  you see the vast majority of your twenty million Negro  brothers smothering in an airtight cage o f poverty in the  midst o f an affluent society when you suddenly find  your tongue twisted and your speech stammering as you  seek to explain to your sixyearold daughter why she  cant go to the public amusement park that has just been  advertised on television and see tears welling up in her  eyes when she is told that Funtown is closed to colored  children and see ominous clouds o f inferiority begin ning to form in her litde mental sky and see her begin ning to distort her personality by developing an uncon scious bitterness toward white people when you have  to concoct an answer for a fiveyearold son who is ask ing Daddy why do white people treat colored people  so mean when you take a crosscounty drive and find    unjust I would be the first to advocate obeying just laws  One has not only a legal but a moral responsibility to  obey just laws Conversely one has a moral responsibility  to disobey unjust laws I would agree with St Augustine  that fan unjust law is no law at all  Now what is the difference between the two How  does one determine whether a law is just o r unjust A  just law is a manmade code that squares with the moral  law or the law of God An unjust law is a code that is out  o f harmony with the moral law To put it in the terms  o f St Thomas Aquinas an unjust law  is a human law  that is not rooted in eternal law and natural law Any law  that uplifts human personality is just Any law that de grades human personality is unjust All segregation  statutes are unjust because segregation distorts the soul  and damages the personality It gives the segregator a  false sense of superiority and the segregated a false sense  o f inferiority Segregation to use the terminology of the  Jewish philosopher Martin Buber substitutes an l it  relationship for an T thou relationship and ends up rel egating persons to the status o f things Hence segregation  is not only politically economically and sociologically  unsound it is morally wrong and sinful Paul Tillich  has said that sin is separation Is not segregation an exist ential expression o f mans tragic separation his awful es trangement his terrible sinfulness Thus it is that I can  marx  marx  marx  marx    it necessary to sleep night after night in the uncomfort able comers o f your automobile because no motel will  accept you when you are humiliated day in and day out  by nagging signs reading white and colored when  your firstname becomes nigger your middle name  becomes boy however old you areandyour last name  becomes John and your wife and mother are never  given the respected title Mrs when you are harried by  day and haunted by night by the fact that you are a  Negro living constandy at tiptoe stance never quite  knowing what to expect next and are plagued with inner  fears and outer resentments when you are forever fight ing a degenerating sense o f nobodiness  then you will  understand why we find it difficult to wait There comes  a time when the cup of endurance runs over and men  are no longer willing to be plunged into the abyss o f  despair I hope sirs you can understand our legitimate  and unavoidable impatience You express a great deal o f  anxiety over our willingness to break laws This is cer tainly a legitimate concern Since we so diligently urge  people to obey the Supreme Courts decision o f 1954  outlawing segregation in the public schools at first  glance it m ay seem rather paradoxical for us consciously  to breaklaws One may well ask How can you advocate  breakingsome laws and obeying others The answer lies  in the fact that there are two types o f laws just and  marx  marx    urge men to obey the 1954 decision of the Supreme  C ourt for it is morally right and I can urge them to diso bey segregation ordinances for they are morally wrong  Let us consider a more concrete example o f just and  unjust laws An unjust law is a code that a numerical or  power majority group compels a minority group to obey  but does not make binding on itself This is difference  made legal By the same token a just law is a code that  a majority compels a minority to follow and that it is  willing to follow itself This is sameness made legal Let  me give another explanation A law is unjust if  it is in flicted on a minority that as a result o f being denied the  right to vote had no part in enacting or devising the law  Who can say that the legislature o f Alabama which set  up that states segregation laws was democratically  elected Throughout Alabama all sorts of devious meth ods are used to prevent Negroes from becoming reg istered voters and there are some counties in which even  though Negroes constitute a majority o f the population  not a single Negro is registered Can any law enacted  under such circumstances be considered democratically  structured  Sometimes a law is just on its face and unjust in its  application For instance I have been arrested on a  charge o f parading without a permit Now there is noth ing wrong in having an ordinance which requires a  marx  marx  marx    permit for a parade But such an ordinance becomes  unjust when it is used to maintain segregation and to  deny citizens the First Amendment privilege of peaceful  assembly and protest  I hope you are able to see the distinction I am trying  to point out In no sense do I advocate evading or defying  the law as would the rabid segregationist That would  lead to anarchy One who breaks an unjust law must do  so openly lovingly and with a willingness to accept the  penalty I submit thatan individual who breaks a law  that conscience tells him is unjust and who willingly  accepts the penalty of imprisonment in order to arouse  the conscience o f the community over its injustice is in  reality expressing the highest respect for law  O f course there is nothing new about this kind o f  civil disobedience It was evidenced sublimely in the  refusal o f Shadrach Meshach and Abednego to obey the  laws o f Nebuchadnezzar on the grourid that a higher  moral law was at stake It was practised superbly by the  early Christians who were willing to face hungry lions  and the excruciating pain o f chopping blocks rather than  submit to certain unjust laws of the Roman Empire To  a degree academic freedom is a reality today because  Socrates practised civil disobedience In our own nation  the Boston Tea Party represented a massive act o f civil  disobedience  marx    We should never forget that everything Adolf Hitler  did in Germany was legal and everything the Hungar ian freedom fighters did in Hungary was illegal It was  illegal to aid and comfort a Jew in Hitlers Germany  Even so I am sure that had I lived in Germany at the  time I would have aided and comforted m y Jewish  brothers If today I lived in a Communist country where  certain principles dear to die Christian faith are suppressed  I would openly advocate disobeying that countrys antire ligious laws  I must make two honest confessions to you my  Christian and Jewish brothers First I must confess that  over the past few years I have been gravely disappoint ed with the white moderate I have almost reached the  regrettable conclusion that the Negros great stumbling  block in his stride toward freedom is not the White Citi zens Counciler or the Ku Klux Klanner but the white  moderate who is more devoted to order than to justice  who prefers a negative peace which is the absence o f  tension to a positive peace which is the presence of just ice who constantly says I agree with you in the goal  you seek but I cannot agree with your methods of direct  action who patemalistically believes he can set the  timetable for another mans freedom w ho lives by   mythical concept of time and who constantly advises the  Negro to wait for a more convenient season Shallow  marx  marx    understanding from people of good will is more frustrat ing than absolute misunderstanding from people o f ill  will Lukewarm acceptance is much more bewildering  than outright rejection  I had hoped that the white moderate would under stand that law and order exist for the purpose of estab lishing justice and that when they fail in this purpose  they become the dangerously structured dams that block  the flow of social progress I had hoped that the white  moderate would understand that the present tension in  the South is a necessary phase o f the transition from an  obnoxious negative peace in which the Negro passively  accepted his unjust plight to a substantive and positive  peace in which all men will respect the dignity and worth  of human personality Actually w ewho engage in non violent direct action are not the creators o f tension We  merely bring to the surface the hidden tension that is  already alive We bring it out in the open where it can be  seen and dealt with Like a boil that can never be cured  so long as it is covered up but must be opened with all its  ugliness to the natural medicines o f air and light injustice  must be exposed with all the tension its exposure creates  to the light o f human conscience and the air o f national  opinion before it can be cured  In your statement you assert that our actions even  marx  marx    though peaceful must be condemned because they pre cipitate violence But is this a logical assertion Isnt this  like condemning a robbed man because his possession  of money precipitated the evil act o f robbery Isnt this  like condemning Socrates because his unswerving com mitment to truth and his philosophical inquiries  precipitated the act by the misguided populace in which  they made him drink hemlock Isnt this like condemn ing Jesus because his unique God consciousness and  never ceasing devotion to Gods will precipitated the evil  act of crucifixion We must come to see that as the fed eral courts have consistently affirmed it is wrong to urge  an individual to cease his efforts to gain his basic consti tutional rights because the quest may precipitate  violence Society must protect the robbed and punish  the robber I had also hoped that the white moderate  would reject the myth concerning time in relation to the  struggle for freedom I have just received a letter from a  white brother in Texas He writes All Christians know  that the colored people will receive equal rights eventu ally but it is possible that you are in too great a religious  hurry It has taken Christianity almost tw o thousand  years to accomplish what it has The teachings o f Christ  take time to come to earth Such an attitude stems from  a tragic misconception o f time from the strangely  marx  marx  marx    irrational notion that there is something in the very flow  of time that will inevitably cure all ills Actually time  itself is neutral it can be used either destructively or  constructively More and more I feel that the people of  ill will have used lime much more effectively than have  the people of good will We will have to repent in this  generation not merely for the hateful words and actions  o f the bad people but for the appalling silence of the  good people Human progress never rolls in on wheels  o f inevitability it comes through the tireless efforts o f  men willing to be coworkers with God andwithoutthis  hard work time itself becomes an ally o f the forces of  social stagnation We must use time creatively in the  knowledge that the time is always ripe to do right Now  is the time to make real the promise of democracy and  transform our pending national elegy into a creative  psalm of brotherhood Now is the time to lift our  national policy from the quicksand o f racial injustice to  the solid rock o f human dignity  You speak of our activity in Birmingham as extreme  At first I was rather disappointed that fellow clergymen  would see my nonviolent efforts as those of an extrem ist I began thinking about the fact that I stand in the  middle o f two opposing forces in the Negro community  One is a force o f complacency made up in part o f  Negroes who as a result of long years of oppression are  marx  marx    so drained o f selfrespect and a sense o f somebodiness  that they have adjusted to segregation and in part o f a  few middleclass Negroes who because of a degree of  academic and economic security and because in some  ways they profit by segregation have become insensitive  to the problems o f the masses The other force is one of  bitterness and hatred and it comes perilously close to  advocating violence It is expressed in the various black  nationalist groups that are springing up across the  nation the largest and best known being Elijah Muham mads Muslim movement Nourished by the Negros  frustration over the continued existence o f racial dis crimination this movement is made up o f people who  have lost faith in America who have absolutely repudi ated Christianity and who have concluded that the white  man is an incorrigible devil   I have tried to stand between these two forces saying  that we need emulate neither the do nothingism o f the  complacent nor the hatred and despair o f the black  nationalist For there is the more excellent way of love  and nonviolent protest I am grateful to God that  through the influence of the Negro church the w ay o f  nonviolence became an integral part of our struggle If  this philosophy had not emerged by now  many streets  o f the South would I am convinced be flowing with  blood And I am further convinced that if our white    brothers dismiss as rabble rousers and outside agita tors those o f us who employ nonviolent direct action  and if  they refuse to support our nonviolent efforts mil lions o f Negroes will out o f frustration and despair seek  solace and security in black nationalist ideologies   a  development that would inevitably lead to a frightening  racial nightmare  Oppressed people cannot remain oppressed forever  The yearning for freedom eventually manifests itself and  that is what has happened to the American Negro Some thing within has reminded him o f his birthright o f  freedom and something without has reminded him that  it can be gained Consciously or unconsciously he has  been caught up by the Zeitgeist and with his black broth ers o f Africa and his brown and yellow brothers o f Asia  South America and the Caribbean the United States  Negro is moving with a sense o f great urgency toward  the promised land of racial justice If one recognizes this  vital urge that has engulfed the Negro community one  should readily understand why public demonstrations  are taking place The Negro has many pentup resent ments and latent frustrations and he must release them  So let him march let him make prayer pilgrimages to  the city hall let him go on freedom rides   and try to  understand why he must do so If his repressed emotions  are not released in nonviolent ways they w ill seek  marx  marx    expression through violence this is not a threat but a fact  of history So I have not said to my people Get rid o f  your discontent Rather I have tried to say that this nor mal and healthy discontent can be channeled into the  creative outlet of nonviolent direct action And now this  approach is being termed extremist But though I was  initially disappointed at being categorized as an extremist  as I continued to think about the matter I gradually  gained a measure of satisfaction from the label Was not  Jesus an extremist for love Love your enemies bless  them that curse you do good to them that hate you and  pray for them which despitefully use you and persecute  you Was not Amos an extremist for justice Let justice  roll down like waters and righteousness like an ever flow ing stream Was not Paul an extremist for the Christian  gospel I bear in my body the marks of the Lord Jesus  Was not Martin Luther an extremist Here I stand I can not do otherwise so help me God And John Bunyan I  will stay in jail to the end o f my days before I make a  butchery o f my conscience And Abraham Lincoln  This nation cannot survive half slave and half free  And Thomas Jefferson We hold these truths to be self  evident that all men are created equal   So the question  is not whether we will be extremists but what kind o f  extremists we will be W ill we be extremists for hate or  for love W ill we be extremists for the preservation o f  marx    injustice or for the extension o f justice In that dramatic  scene on Calvarys hill three men were crucified We  must never forget that all three were crucified for the  same crime   the crime o f extremism Two were extrem ists for immorality and thus fell below their environment  The other Jesus Christ was an extremist for love truth  and goodness and thereby rose above his environment  Perhaps the South the nation and the worldare in dire  need of creative extremists  I had hoped that the white moderate would see this  need Perhaps I was too optimistic perhaps I expected  too much I suppose I should have realized that few  members o f the oppressor race can understand the deep  groans and passionate yearnings o f the oppressed race  and still fewer have the vision to see that injustice must  be rooted out by strong persistent and determined  action I am thankful however that some of our white  brothers in the South have grasped the meaning o f this  social revolution and committed themselves to it They  are still all too few in quantity but they are bigin quality  Some   such as Ralph McGill Lillian Smith Harry  Golden James McBride Dabbs Ann Braden and Sarah  Patton Boyle   have written about our struggle in elo quent and prophetic terms Others have marched with  us down nameless streets o f the South They have lan guished in filthy roachinfested jails suffering the abuse  marx    and brutality o f policemen who view  them as dirty  niggerlovers  Unlike so many o f their moderate broth ers and sisters they have recognized the urgency o f the  moment and sensed the need for powerful action anti dotes to combat the disease o f segregation Let me take  note o f my other major disappointment I have been so  greatly disappointed with the white church and its lead ership O f course there are some notable exceptions I  am not unmindful o f the feet that each o f you has taken  some significant stands on this issue I commend you  Reverend Stallings for your Christian stand on this past  Sunday in welcoming Negroes to your worship service  on a nonsegregated basis I commend the Catholic lead ers of this state for integrating Spring Hill College several  years ago  But despite these notable exceptions I must honestly  reiterate that I have been disappointed with the church  I do not say this as one o f those negative critics who can  always find something wrong with the church I say this  as a minister o f the gospel who loves the church who  was nurtured in its bosom who has been sustained by  its spiritual blessings and who will remain true to it as  long as the cord o f life shall lengthen  When I was suddenly catapulted into the leadership  o f the bus protest in Montgomery Alabama a few years  ago I felt we would be supported by the white church    I felt that the white ministers priests and rabbis of die  South would be among our strongest allies Instead  some have been outright opponents refusing to under stand the freedom movement and misrepresenting its  leaders all too many others have been more cautious  than courageous and have remained silent behind the  anaesthetizing security o f stained glass windows  In spite o f my shattered dreams I came to Birming ham with the hope that the white religious leadership o f  this community would see the justice of our cause and  with deep moral concern would serve as the channel  through which our just grievances could reach the power  structure I had hoped that each o f you would under stand But again I have been disappointed  I have heard numerous southern religious leaders  admonish their worshipers to comply with a desegrega tion decision because it is the law but I have longed to  hear white ministers declare Follow this decree because  integration is morally right and because the Negro is  your brother In the midst o f blatant injustices inflicted  upon the Negro I have watched white churchmen stand  on the sideline and mouth pious irrelevancies and sanc timonious trivialities In the midst o f a mighty struggle  to rid our nation o f racial and economic injustice I have  heard many ministers say Those are social issues with  which the gospel has no real concern And I have    watched many churches commit themselves to a com pletely otherworldly religion which makes a strange  unBiblical distinction between body and soul between  the sacred and the secular  I have traveled the length and breadth o f Alabama  Mississippi and all the other southemstates On swelter ing summer days and crisp autumn mornings I have  looked at the Souths beautiful churches with their lofty  spires pointing heavenward I have beheld the impressive  outlines o f her massive religious education buildings  Over and over I have found myself asking W hat kind  o f people worship here W ho is their God Where were  their voices when the lips o f Governor Barnett dripped  with words o f interposition and nullification Where  were they when Governor Wallace gave a clarion call for  defiance and hatred Where were their voices o f support  when bruised and weary Negro men and women decided  to rise from the dark dungeons of complacency to the  bright hills o f creative protest  Yes these questions are still in my mind In deep disap pointment I have wept over the laaity o f the church But  be assured that my tears have been tears of love There  can be no deep disappointment where there is not deep  love Yes I love the church How could I do otherwise I  am in the rather unique position o f being the son the  grandson and the greatgrandson of preachers Yes I see  marx  marx    the church as the body of Christ But oh How we have  blemished and scarred that body through social neglect  and through fear of being nonconformists  There was a time when the church was very powerful    in the time when the early Christians rejoiced at being  deemed worthy to suffer for what they believed In those  days the church was not merely a thermometer that  recorded the ideas and principles of popular opinion it  was a thermostat that transformed the mores o f society  Whenever the early Christians entered a town the people  in power became disturbed and immediately sought to  convict the Christians for being disturbers o f the peace  and outside agitators But the Christians pressed on in  the conviction that they were a colony o f heaven called  to obey God rather than man Small in number they  were big in commitment They were too Godintoxicated  to be astronomically intimidated By their effort and  example they brought an end to such ancient evils as  infanticide and gladiatorial contests Things are different  now So often the contemporary church is a weak inef fectual voice with an uncertain sound So often it is an  archdefender o f the status quo Far from being disturbed  by the presence o f the church the power structure of the  average community is consoled by the churchs silent    and often even vocal   sanction of things as they are    But the judgment of God is upon the church as never  before If today s church does not recapture the sacrifi cial spirit of the early church it will lose its authenticity  forfeit the loyalty o f millions and be dismissed as an  irrelevant social club with no meaning for the twentieth  century Every day I meet young people whose disap pointment with the church has turned into outright  disgust  Perhaps I have once again been too optimistic Is  organized religion too inextricably bound to the status  quo to save our nation and the world Perhaps I must  turn m y faith to the inner spiritual church the church  within the church as the true ekklesia and the hope o f  the world But again I am thankful to God that some  noble souls from the ranks o f organized religion have  broken loose from the paralyzing chains o f conformity  and joined us as active partners in the struggle for free dom They have left their secure congregations and  walked the streets o f Albany Georgia with us They  have gone down the highways o f the South on tortuous  rides for freedom Yes they have gone to jail with us  Some have been dismissed from their churches have lost  the support o f their bishops and fellow ministers But  they have acted in the faith that right defeated is stronger  than evil triumphant Their witness has been the spir  marx    itual salt that has preserved the true meaning o f the  gospel in these troubled limes They have carved a tunnel  of hope through the dark mountain o f disappointment  I hope the church as a whole will meet the challenge of  this decisive hour But even if the church does not come  to the aid o f justice I have no despair about the future  I have no fear about the outcome o f our struggle in  Birmingham even if  our motives are at present misun derstood W e will reach the goal o f freedom  in  Birmingham and all over the nation because the goal o f  America is freedom Abused and scorned though we  may be our destiny is tied up with Americas destiny  Before the pilgrims landed at Plymouth we were here  Before the pen o f Jefferson etched the majestic words o f  the Declaration o f Independence across the pages o f his tory we w ere here For more than tw o centuries our  forebears labored in this country without wages they  made cotton king they built the homes o f their masters  while suffering gross injustice and shameful humiliation    and yet out o f a bottomless vitality they continued to  thrive and develop If the inexpressible cruelties o f slav ery could not stop us the opposition w e now  face w ill  surely fail We will win our freedom because the sacred  heritage o f our nation and the eternal will o f God are  embodied in our echoing demands Before closing I  feel impelled to mention one other point in your state  marx  marx    ment that has troubled me profoundly You warm ly  commended the Birmingham police force for keeping  order and preventing violence I doubt that you would   have so warm ly commended the police force if  you  had seen its dogs sinking their teeth into unarmed non violent Negroes I doubt that you would so quickly  commend the policemen if you were to observe their  ugly and inhumane treatment o f Negroes here in the  city j ail if you were to watch them push and curse old  Negro women and young Negro girls if y ou were to see  them slap and kick old Negro men and young boys if  you were to observe them as they did on two occasions  refuse to give us food because we wanted to sing our  grace together I cannot join you in your praise o f the  Birmingham police department  It is true that the police have exercised a degree of  discipline in handling the demonstrators In this sense  they have conducted themselves rather nonviolently in  public But for what purpose To preserve the evil sys tem  o f segregation Over the past few years I have  consistently preached that nonviolence demands that the  means we use must be as pure as the ends we seek I have  tried to make clear that it is wrong to use immoral means  to attain moral ends But now I must affirm that it is just  as w rong or perhaps even more so to use moral means  to preserve immoral ends Perhaps Mr Connor and his  marx    policemen have been rather nonviolent in public as was  Chief Pritchett in Albany Georgia but they have used  the m oral means o f nonviolence to maintain the  immoral end o f racial injustice As T S Eliot has said  T h e  last temptation is the greatest treason To do the  right deed for the wrong reason  I wish you had commended the Negro sitinners and  demonstrators o f Birmingham for their sublime cour age their willingness to suffer and their amazing  discipline in the midst o f great provocation One day the  South will recognize its real heroes They will be the  James Merediths with the noble sense o f purpose that  enables them to face jeering and hostile mobs and with  the agonizing loneliness that characterizes the life o f the  pioneer They will be old oppressed battered Negro  women symbolized in a seventytwoyearold woman  in Montgomery Alabama who rose up with a sense o f  dignity and w ith her people decided not to ride segre gated buses and who responded with ungrammatical  profundity to one who inquired about her weariness  My feets is tired but my soul is at rest They will be the  young high school and college students the young min isters o f the gospel and ahostof their elders courageously  and nonviolently sittingin at lunch counters and will ingly going to jail for conscience sake One day the  South w ill know that when these disinherited children  marx    o f God sat down at lunch counters they were in reality  standing up for what is best in the American dream and  for the most sacred values in our JudaeoChristian herit age thereby bringing our nation back to those great  wells of democracy which were dug deep by the found ing fathers in their formulation o f the Constitution and  the Declaration of Independence  Never before have I written so long a letter Im afraid  it is much too long to take your precious time I can  assure you that it would have been much shorter if I had  been writing from a comfortable desk but what else can  one do when he is alone in a narrow jail cell other than  write long letters think long thoughts and pray long  prayers  If I have said anything in this letter that overstates the  truth and indicates an unreasonable impatience I beg  you to forgive me If I have said anything that under states the truth and indicates my having a patience that  allows me to settle for anything less than brotherhood  I beg God to forgive me  I hope this letter finds you strong in the faith I also  hope that circumstances will soon make it possible for  me to meet each of you not as an integrationist or a civil  rights leader but as a fellow clergyman and a Christian  brother Let us all hope that the dark clouds o f racial  prejudice w ill soon pass away and the deep fog o f    misunderstanding will be lifted from our feardrenched  communities and in some not too distant tomorrow the  radiant stars of love and brotherhood will shine over our  great nation with all their scintillating beauty  Yours for the cause o f Peace and Brotherhood  Martin Luther King Jr    The Three Dimensions o f a Complete Life  I want to use as the subject from which to preach  T h e Three Dimensions of a Complete Life You know  they used to tell us in Hollywood that in order for a  movie to be complete it had to be threedimension al Well this morning I want to seek to get over to each  o f us that if life itself is to be complete it must be  threedimensional  Many many centuries ago there was a man by the  name o f John who found himself in prison out on a  lonely obscure island called Patmos And Ive been in  prison just enough to know that its a lonely experience  And when you are incarcerated in such a situation you  are deprived o f almost every freedom but the freedom  to think the freedom to pray the freedom to reflect and  to meditate And while John was out on this lonely island  in prison he lifted his vision to high heaven and he saw  descending out o f heaven a new heaven and a new  earth Over in the twentyfirst chapter o f the book of  Revelation it opens by saying And I saw a new heaven  3i    and a new earth And I John saw the holy dty the new  Jerusalem coming down from God out o f heaven  And one o f the greatest glories o f this new d ty of  God that John saw was its completeness It was not up  on one side and down on the other but it was complete  in all three of its dimensions And so in this same chapter  as we looked down to the sixteenth verse John says The  length and the breadth and the height of it are equal In  other words this new dty o f God this new d ty o f ideal  humanity is not an unbalanced entity but is complete on  all sides Now I think John is saying something here in all  of the symbolism of this text and the symbolism o f this  chapter Hes saying at bottom that life as it should be  and life at its best is a life that is complete on all sides  And there are three dimensions o f any complete life  to which we can fidy give the words o f this text length  breadth and height Now the length of life as we shall  use it here is the inward concern for ones own welfare  In other words it is that inward concern that causes one  to push forward to achieve his own goals and ambitions  The breadth o f life as we shall use it here is the outward  concern for the welfare of others And the height of life  is the upward reach for God N ow  you got to have all  three o f these to have a complete life  Now lets turn for the moment to the length o f life I  said that this is the dimension o f life where we are    concerned with developing our inner powers In a sense  this is the selfish dimension o f life There is such a thing  as rational and healthy selfinterest A great Jewish rabbi  the late Joshua Leibman wrote a book some years ago  entitled Peace of Mind And he has a chapter in that book  entitled Love Thyself Properly  And what he says in  that chapter in substance is that before you can love  other selves adequately youve got to love your own self  properly You know a lot o f people dont love them selves And they go through life with deep and haunting  emotional conflicts So the length o f life means that you  must love yourself  And you know what loving yourself also means It  means that youve got to accept yourself So many peo ple are busy trying to be somebody else God gave all o f  us something significant And we must pray every day  asking God to help us to accept ourselves That means  everything Too many Negroes are ashamed o f them selves ashamed of being black A Negro got to rise up  and say from the bottom of his soul I am somebody I  have a rich noble and proud heritage However  exploited and however painful my history has been Im  black but Im black and beautiful This is what weve  got to say Weve got to accept ourselves And we must  prayLord Help me to accept myself every day help  me to accept my tools    I remember when I was in college I majored in sociol ogy and all sociology majors had to take a course that  was required called statistics And statistics can be very  complicated youve got to have a mathematical mind a  real knowledge o f geometry and youve got to know  how to find the mean the mode and the median I never  will forget I took this course and I had a fellow classmate  who could just work that stuff out you know And he  could do his homework in about an hour We would  often go to the lab or the workshop and he would just  work it out in about an hour and it was over for him  And I was trying to do what he was doing I was trying  to do mine in an hour And the more I tried to do it in an  hour the more I was flunking out in the course And I  had to come to a very hard conclusion I had to sit down  and say Now Martin Luther King Leif Cane has a bet ter mind than you Sometimes you have to acknowledge  that And I had to say to myself Now he may be able to  do it in an hour but it takes me two or three hours to do  it I was not willing to accept myself I was not willing  to accept my tools and my limitations  But you know in life w ere called upon to do this A  Ford car trying to be a Cadillac is absurd but if a Ford  will accept itself as a Ford it can do many things that a  Cadillac could never do it can get in parking spaces that  a Cadillac can never get in And in life some o f us are    Fords and some of us are Cadillacs Moses says in Green  Pastures Lord I aint much but I is all I got The prin ciple of selfacceptance is a basic principle in life  Now the other thing about the length o f life after  accepting ourselves and our tools we must discover  what we are called to do And once we discover it we  should set out to do it with all of the strength and all o f  the power that we have in our systems And after weve  discovered what God called us to do after weve discov ered our lifes work we should set out to do that work  so well that the living the dead or the unborn couldnt  do it any better Now this does not mean that everybody  w ill do the socalled big recognized things o f life Very  few people will rise to the heights of genius in the arts  and the sciences very few collectively will rise to certain  professions Most of us will have to be content to work  in the fields and in the factories and on the streets But  we must see the dignity of all labor  W hen I was in Montgomery Alabama I went to a  shoe shop quite often known as the Gordon Shoe Shop  And there was a fellow in there that used to shine my  shoes and it was just an experience to witness this fellow  shining my shoes He would get that rag you know and  he could bring music out of it And I said to myself This  fellow has a PhD in shoe shining  W hat Im saying to you this morning my friends    even if it falls your lot to be a street sweeper go on out  and sweep streets like Michelangelo painted pictures  sweep streets like Handel and Beethoven composed  music sweep streets like Shakespeare wrote poetry  sweep streets so well that all the host o f heaven and earth  w ill have to pause and say Here lived a great street  sweeper who swept his job well  If you cant be a pine on the top of a hill Be a scrub in the valley   but be The best little scrub on the side of the hill Be a bush if you cant be a tree If you cant be a highway just be a trail  If you cant be the sun be a star It isnt by size that you win or fail    Be the best of whatever you are  And when you do this when you do this youve mas tered the length o f life  This onward push to die end o f selffulfillment is the  end o f a persons life Now dont stop here though You  know a lot o f people get no further in life than the  length They develop their inner powers they do their  jobs well But do you know they try to live as if  nobody  else lives in the world but themselves And they use eve rybody as mere tools to get to where theyre going They  dont love anybody but themselves And the only kind    of love that they really have for other people is utilitarian  love You know they just love people that they can use  A lot o f people never get beyond the first dimension  of life They use other people as mere steps by which  they can climb to their goals and their ambitions These  people dont work out w ell in life They may go for  awhile they may think theyre making it all right but  there is a law They call it the law of gravitation in the  physical universe and it works its final its inexorable  whatever goes up can come down You shall reap what  you sow God has structured the universe that way And  he who goes through life not concerned about others  will be a subject a victim o f this law  So I move on and say that it is necessary to add breadth  to length Now the breadth of life is the outward con cern for the welfare o f others as I said And a man has  not begun to live until he can rise above the narro w  con fines o f his own individual concerns to the broader  concerns o f all humanity  One day Jesus told a parable You will remember that  parable He had a man that came to him to talkwithhim   about some very profound concerns And they finally  got around to the question Who is my neighbor And  this man wanted to debate with Jesus This question  could have very easily ended up in thin air as a theologi cal or philosophical debate But you remember Jesus    immediately pulled that question out o f thin air and  placed it on a dangerous curve between Jerusalem and  Jericho He talked about a certain man who fell among  thieves Two men came by and they just kept going And  then finally another man came a member o f another  race w ho stopped and helped him And that parable  ends up saying that this good Samaritan was a great man  he was a good man because he was concerned about  more than himself  Now you know there are many ideas about why the  priest and the Levite passed and didnt stop to help that  man A lot of ideas about it Some say that they were  going to a church service and they were running a little  late you know and couldnt be late for church so they kept  going because they had to get down to the synagogue  And then there are others who would say that they were  involved in the priesthood and consequently there was  a priestly law which said that if you were going to admin ister the sacrament or what have you you couldnt touch  a human body twentyfour hours before worship Now  theres another possibility It is possible that they were  going down to Jericho to organize a Jericho Road Im provement Association Thats another possibility And  they may have passed by because they felt that it was  better to deal with the problem from the causal source  rather than one individual victim Thats a possibility    But you kno w when I think about this parable I think  o f another possibility as I use my imagination Its pos sible that these men passed by on the other side because  they were afraid You know the Jericho Road is a danger ous road Ive been on it and I know And I never w ill  forget Mrs King and I were in the Holy Land some time  ago We rented a car and we drove fromjerusalemdown  to Jericho a distance of about sixteen miles You get on  that Jericho road   Im telling you its a winding curving  meandering road very conducive for robbery And I said  to my wife N ow  I can see why Jesus used this road as  the occasion for his parable Here you are when you  start out in Jerusalem you are twentytwo hundred feet  above sea level and when you get down to Jericho six teen miles later   I mean you have sixteen miles from  Jerusalem   youre twelve hundred feet below sea level  During the days of Jesus that road came to the point  of being known as the Bloody Path So when I think  about the priest and the Levite I think those brothers  were afraid  They were just like me I was going out to my fathers  house in Atlanta the other day He lives about three or  four miles from me and you go out there by going  down Simpson Road And then when I came back later  that night   and brother I can teU you Simpson Road  is a winding road And a fellow was standing out there    trying to flag me down And I felt that he needed some  help I knew he needed help But I didnt know it Til be  honest with you I kept going I wasnt really willing to  take the risk  I say to you this morning that the first question that  the priest asked was the first question that I asked on that  Jericho Road of Atlanta known as Simpson Road The  first question that the Levite asked was T f I stop to help  this man what will happen to me But the good Samari tan came by and he reversed the question Not What  will happen to me if I stop to help this man but W hat  will happen to this man if I do not stop to help him This  was w hy that man was good and great He was great  because he was willing to take a risk for humanity he  was willing to askW hat w ill happen to this man not  What will happen to me  This is what God needs today men and women who  will ask What will happen to humanity if  I dont help  What will happen to the ci vil rights movement if  I dont  participate W hat will happen to my city if I dont vote  What will happen to the sick if I dont visit them This  is how God judges people in the final analysis  Oh there will be a day the question wont be How  many awards did you get in life Not that day It wont  be H ow popular were you in your social setting That  wont be the question that day It will not ask how many    degrees youve been able to get The question that day  will not be concerned with whether you are a PhD or  a no D   It will not be concerned with whether you  went to Morehouse or whether you went to No House  The question that day will not be H ow  beautiful is  your house The question that day will not be H ow  much money did you accumulate How much did  you have in stocks and bonds The question that day  will not be W hat kind o f automobile did you have  On that day the question will be W hat did you do  for others  Now I can hear somebody saying Xord I did a lot of  things in life I did my job well the world honored me  for doing m y job I did a lot o f things Lord I went to  school and studied hard I accumulated a lot o f money  Lord thats what I did It seems as if  I can hear the Lord  o f Life saying But I was hungry and ye fed me not I  was sick and ye visited me not I was naked and ye  clothed me not I was in prison and you werent con cerned about me So get out o f my face What did you  do for others This is the breadth of life  Somewhere along the way we must learn that there  is nothing greater than to do something for others And  this is the way Ive decided to go the rest of my days  Thats what Im concerned about John if you and Ber nard happen to be around when I come to the latter days    and that moment to cross the Jordan I want you to tell  them that I made a request I don t want a long funeral  In fact I dont even need a eulogy more than one or two  minutes I hope that I will live so well the rest of the  days  1 dont know how long Ill live and Im not com  cemed about that   but I hope I can live so well that the  preacher can get up and say He was faithful Thats all  thats enough Thats the sermon Id like to hear Well  done my good and faithful servant Youve been faithful  youve been concerned about others Thats where I  want to go from this point on for the rest o f my days  He who is greatest among you shall be your servant I  want to be a servant I want to be a witness for my Lord  to do something for others  And dont forget in doing something for others that  you have what you have because o f others Dont forget  that We are tied together in life and in the world And  you may think you got all you got by yourself But you  know before you got out here to church this morning  you were dependent on more than half o f the world  You get up in the morning and go to the bathroom  and you reach over for a bar o f soap and thats handed  to you by a Frenchman You reach over for a sponge and  thats given to you by a Turk You reach over for a towel  and that comes to your hand from the hands o f a Pacific  Islander And then you go on to the kitchen to get your    breakfast You reach on over to get a little coffee and  thats poured in your cup by a South American Or  maybe you decide that you want a litde tea this morning  only to discover that thats poured in your cup by a Chi nese Or maybe you want a little cocoa thats poured in  your cup by a West African Then you want a little bread  and you reach over to get it and thats given to you by  the hands o f an Englishspeaking farmer not to mention  the baker Before you get through eating breakfast in the  morning youre dependent on more than half the world  Thats the way God structured it thats the way God  structured this world So let us be concerned about oth ers because we are dependent on others  But dont stop here either You know a lot o f people  master the length o f life and they master the breadth of  life but they stop right there Now if  life is to be com plete we must move beyond our selfinterest We must  move beyond humanity and reach up way up for the  God o f the universe whose purpose changeth not  Now a lot of people have neglected this third dimen sion And you know the interesting thing is a lot o f  people neglect it and dont even know they are neglect ing it They just get involved in other things And you  know there are two kinds o f atheism Atheism is the  theory that there is no God N ow  one kind is a theoreti cal kind where somebody just sits down and starts    thinking about it and they come to a conclusion that  there is no God The other kind is a practical atheism  and that kind goes out of living as if there is no God And  you know there are a lot of people who affirm the exist ence of God with their lips and they deny his existence  with their lives Youve seen these people who have a  high blood pressure of creeds and an anemia of deeds  They deny the existence of God with their lives and they  just become so involved in other things They become  so involved in getting a bigbank account They become  so involved in getting a beautiful house which we all  should have They become so involved in getting a beau tiful car that they unconsciously just forget about God  There are those who become so involved in looking at  the manmade lights o f the city that they unconsciously  forget to rise up and look at that great cosmic lightand  think about i t   that gets up in the eastern horizon every  morning and moves across the sky with a kind of sym phony o f motion and paints its technicolor across the  blue   a light that man can never make They become so  involved in looking at the skyscraping buildings of the  Loop of Chicago or Empire State Building o f New York  that they unconsciously forget to think about the gigan  tic mountains that kiss the skies as if to bathe their peaks  in the lofty blue   something that man could never make  They become so busy thinking about radar and their    television that they unconsciously forget to think about  the stars that bedeck the heavens like swinging lanterns  o f eternity those stars that appear to be shiny silvery  pins sticking in the magnificent blue pincushion They  become so involved in thinking about mans progress  that they forget to think about the need for Gods power  in history They end up going days and days not knowing  that God is not with them  And Im here to tell you today that we need God  Modem man may know a great deal but his knowledge  does not eliminate God And I tell you this morning that  God is here to stay A few theologians are trying to say  that God is dead And Ive been asking them about it  because it disturbs me to know that God died and I didnt  have a chance to attend the funeral They havent been  able to tell me yet the date o f his death They havent  been able to tell me yet who the coroner was that pro nounced him dead They havent been able to tell me yet  where hes buried  You see when I think about God I know his name  He said somewhere back in the Old Testament T want  you to go out Moses and tell them I Am sent you  He saidjust to make it dear let them know that my last  name is the same as my first I Am that I Am  Make  that dear I Am And God is the only being in the uni verse that can say I Am and put a period behind it Each    of us sitting here has to say 1 am because of my parents  I am because o f certain environmental conditions I am  because o f certain hereditary circumstances I am  because o f God But God is tbe only being tbat can just  say I Am and stop right there I Am that I Am  And  Hes here to stay Let nobody make us feel that we dont  need God  As I come to my conclusion this morning I want to  say that we should search for him We were made for  God and we will be restless until we find rest in him  And I say to you this morning that this is the personal  faith that has kept me going Im not worried about the  future You know even on this race question Im not  worried I was down in Alabama the other day and I  started thinking about the state o f Alabama where we  worked so hard and may continue to elect the Wallaces  And down in my home state o f Georgia we have another  sick governor by the name of Lester Maddox And all o f  these things can get you confused but they dont worry  me Because the God that I worship is a God that has a  way o f saying even to kings and even to governors Be  still and know that I am God And God has not yet  turned over this universe to Lester Maddox and Lurleen  Wallace Somewhere I read The earth is the Lords and  the fulness thereof and Im going on because I have  faith in Him I do not know what the future holds but I    do know who holds the future And if  Hell guide us and  hold our hand well go on in  I remember down in Montgomery Alabama an expe rience that Id like to share with you W hen we were in  the midst o f the bus boycott we had a marvelous old  lady that we affectionately called Sister Pollard She was  a wonderful lady about seventytwo years old and she  was still w orking at that age During the boycott she  would walk every day to and from work She was one  that somebody stopped one day and said Wouldnt you  like to ride And she said N o And then the driver  moved on and stopped and thought and backed up a  little and said Well arent you tired She said Yes my  feets is tired but my soul is rested  She was a marvelous lady And one week I can remem ber that I had gone through a very difficult week  Threatening calls had come in all day and all night the  night before and I was beginning to falter and to get  weak within and to lose my corage And I never w ill  forget that I went to the mass meeting that Monday  night very discouraged and a litde afraid and wondering  whether we were going to win the struggle And I got  up to make my talk that night but it didnt come out  with strength and power Sister Pollard came up to me  after the meeting and said Son whats wrong with  you Said You didnt talk strong enough tonight    And I said Nothing is wrong Sister Pollard Im all  right  She said You cant fool me Said Something wrong  with you And then she went on to say these words  Is the white folks doing som ething to you that you  dont like  I said Everything is going to be all right Sister  Pollard  And then she finally said Now come close to me and  let me tell you something one more time and I want you  to hear it this time She said Now I done told you we  is with you She said Now even if  we aint with you  the Lord is with you And she concluded by saying The  Lords going to take care of you  And Ive seen many things since that day Ive gone  through many experiences since thatnight in Montgom ery Alabama Since that time Sister Pollard has died  Since that time Ive been in more than eighteen jail cells  Since that lime Ive come perilously close to death at the  hands o f a demented Negro woman Since that time Ive  seen my home bombed three limes Since that lime Ive  had to live every day under the threat o f death Since that  time Ive had many frustrating and bewildering nights  But over and over again I can still hear Sister Pollards  words Gods going to take care o f you So today I can  face any man and any woman with my feet solidly placed    on the ground and my head in the air because I know  that when you are right God will fight your batde  Darker yet may be the night Harder yet may be the fight Just stand up for that which is right  It seems that I can hear a voice speaking even this morn ing saying to all o f us Stand up for what is right Stand  up for what is just Lo I will be with you even until the  end o f the world Yes IVe seen the lightning flash Ive  heard the thunder roll Ive felt sinbreakers dashing try ing to conquer my soul But I heard the voice o f Jesus  saying still to fi ght on He promised never to leave me  never to leave me alone No never alone No never  alone He promised never to leave me never to leave me  alone And I go on in believing that Reach out and find  the breadth of life  You may not be able to define God in philosophical  terms Men through the ages have tried to talk about  him Plato said that he was the Architectonic Good Aris totle called him the Unmoved Mover Hegel called him  the Absolute Whole Then there was a man named Paul  Tillich who called him BeingItself W e dont need to  know all o f these highsounding terms Maybe we have  to know him and discover him another way One day you  ought to rise up and say T know him because hes a lily    of the valley Hes a bright and morning star Hes a rose  o f Sharon Hes a battleaxe in the lime o f Babylon And  then somewhere you ought to just reach out and say  Hes my everything Hes my mother and my father  Hes my sister and my brother Hes a friend to the  friendless This is the God o f the universe And if  you  believe in him and worship him something w ill happen  in your life You will smile when others around you are  crying This is the power o f G od  Go out this morning Love yourself and that means  rational and healthy selfinterest You are commanded to  do that Thats the length o f life Then follow that Love  your neighbor as you love yourself You are commanded  to do that Thats the breadth of life And Im going to  take my seat now by letting you know that theres a first  and even greater commandment Love the Lord thy  God with all thy heart with all thy soul with all thy  strength I think thepsychologist would just say with all  thy personality And when you do that youve got the  breadth o f life  And when you get all three o f these together you can  walk and never get weary You can look up and see the  morning stars singing together and the sons o f God  shouting for joy W hen you get all o f these working  together in your very life judgement will roll down like  waters and righteousness like a mighty stream    When you get all the three of these together the lamb  will lie down with the lion  When you get all three o f these together you lookup  and every valley will be exalted and every hill and moun tain will be made low die rough places will be made  plain and the crooked places straight and the glory of  the Lord shall be revealed and all flesh will see it together  When you get all three o f these working together  you will do unto others as youd have them do unto you  W hen you get all three o f these together you will  recognize that out of one blood God made all men to  dwell upon the face o f the earth     Recording interrupted    Blank Page  Blank Page  Blank Page <EOS>

Bertrand Russell      Preface to the 2006 Edition    This is a revised edition of my own favorite among the books I have written mainly because it addresses a fundamental question that seldom gets the attention it deserves What are the underlying assumptions behind the very different ideological visions of the world being contested in modern times The purpose here will not be to determine which of these visions is more valid but rather to reveal the inherent logic behind each of these sets of views and the ramifications of their assumptions which lead not only to different conclusions on particular issues but also to wholly different meanings to such fundamental words as justice equality and power Although this is in one sense a book about the history of ideas it is also very much about our own times for this conflict of visions is as sharply contested today as it has been over the past two centuries    Two other books of mine do seek to examine the validity of different visionsThe Vision of the Anointed and The Quest for Cosmic Justicebut that is not the task in A Conflict of Visions Together these three books might be considered an informal trilogy though each was written to stand alone However I cannot claim to have stood alone when preparing this revised edition for my two assistants Na Liu and Elizabeth Costa have made major contributions in ferreting out errors and inconsistencies and in preparing the computerized work for publication    Thomas Sowell   The Hoover Institution    Stanford University         Preface to the 1987 Edition    A conflict of visions differs from a conflict between contending interests When interests are at stake the parties directly affected usually understand clearly what the issue is and what they individually stand to gain or lose The general public may not understandand indeed may be confused precisely because of the propaganda of the contending parties But such public confusion is the direct consequence of the clarity of the interested parties themselves However when there is a conflict of visions those most powerfully affected by a particular vision may be the least aware of its underlying assumptionsor the least interested in stopping to examine such theoretical questions when there are urgent practical issues to be confronted crusades to be launched or values to be defended at all costs    Yet visions are not mere emotional drives On the contrary they have a remarkable logical consistency even if those devoted to these visions have seldom investigated that logic Nor are visions confined to zealots and ideologues We all have visions They are the silent shapers of our thoughts    Visions may be moral political economic religious or social In these or other realms we sacrifice for our visions and sometimes if need be face ruin rather than betray them Where visions conflict irreconcilably whole societies may be torn apart Conflicts of interests dominate the short run but conflicts of visions dominate history    We will do almost anything for our visions except think about them The purpose of this book is to think about them    Thomas Sowell   The Hoover Institution    Stanford University           PART I    PATTERNS      Chapter 1    The Role of Visions    One of the curious things about political opinions is how often the same people line up on opposite sides of different issues The issues themselves may have no intrinsic connection with each other They may range from military spending to drug laws to monetary policy to education Yet the same familiar faces can be found glaring at each other from opposite sides of the political fence again and again It happens too often to be coincidence and it is too uncontrolled to be a plot A closer look at the arguments on both sides often shows that they are reasoning from fundamentally different premises These different premisesoften implicit are what provide the consistency behind the repeated opposition of individuals and groups on numerous unrelated issues They have different visions of how the world works    It would be good to be able to say that we should dispense with visions entirely and deal only with reality But that may be the most utopian vision of all Reality is far too complex to be comprehended by any given mind Visions are like maps that guide us through a tangle of bewildering complexities Like maps visions have to leave out many concrete features in order to enable us to focus on a few key paths to our goals Visions are indispensablebut dangerous precisely to the extent that we confuse them with reality itself What has been deliberately neglected may not in fact turn out to be negligible in its effect on the results That has to be tested against evidence    A vision has been described as a preanalytic cognitive act1 It is what we sense or feel before we have constructed any systematic reasoning that could be called a theory much less deduced any specific consequences as    hypotheses to be tested against evidence A vision is our sense of how the world works For example primitive mans sense of why leaves move may have been that some spirit moves them and his sense of why tides rise or volcanoes erupt may have run along similar lines Newton had a very different vision of how the world works and Einstein still another For social phenomena Rousseau had a very different vision of human causation from that of Edmund Burke    Visions are the foundations on which theories are built The final structure depends not only on the foundation but also on how carefully and consistently the framework of theory is constructed and how well buttressed it is with hard facts Visions are very subjective but wellconstructed theories have clear implications and facts can test and measure their objective validity The world learned at Hiroshima that Einsteins vision of physics was not just Einsteins vision    Logic is an essential ingredient in the process of turning a vision into a theory just as empirical evidence is then essential for determining the validity of that theory But it is the initial vision which is crucial for our glimpse of insight into the way the world works In Paretos words  Logic is useful for proof but almost never for making discoveries A man receives certain impressions under their influence he states without being able to say either how or why and if he attempts to do so he deceives himselfa proposition which can be verified experimentally2          Visions are all to some extent simplisticthough that is a term usually reserved for other peoples visions not our own The everchanging kaleidoscope of raw reality would defeat the human mind by its complexity except for the minds ability to abstract to pick out parts and think of them as the whole This is nowhere more necessary than in social visions and    social theory dealing with the complex and often subconscious interactions of millions of human beings    No matter what vision we build on it will never account for every sparrows fall Social visions especially must leave many important phenomena unexplained or explained only in ad hoc fashion or by inconsistent assumptions that derive from more than one vision The purest vision may not be the basis of the most impressive theories much less the most valid ones Yet purer visions may be more revealing as to unspoken premises than are the more complex theories For purposes of understanding the role of visions William Godwins Enquiry Concerning Political Justice 1793 may tell us more than Marxs Capital Indeed we may understand more of Marxs Capital after we have seen how similar premises worked out in the less complicated model of William Godwin Likewise the vision of social causation underlying the theories of the Physiocrats was in its essentials very much like the vision elaborated in a more complex and sophisticated way by Adam Smith and still later and still more so by Milton Friedman    A vision as the term is used here is not a dream a hope a prophecy or a moral imperative though any of these things may ultimately derive from some particular vision Here a vision is a sense of causation It is more like a hunch or a gut feeling than it is like an exercise in logic or factual verification These things come later and feed on the raw material provided by the vision If causation proceeds as our vision conceives it to then certain other consequences follow and theory is the working out of what those consequences are Evidence is fact that discriminates between one theory and another Facts do not speak for themselves They speak for or against competing theories Facts divorced from theory or visions are mere isolated curiosities    Ultimately there are as many visions as there are human beings if not more and more than one vision may be consistent with a given fact Theories can be devastated by facts but they can never be proved to be correct by facts Facts force us to discard some theoriesor else to torture    our minds trying to reconcile the irreconcilablebut they can never put the final imprimatur of ultimate truth on a given theory What empirical verification can do is to reveal which of the competing theories currently being considered is more consistent with what is known factually Some other theory may come along tomorrow that is still more consistent with the facts or explains those facts with fewer clearer or more manageable assumptionsor a new theory may fit both this and other empirical phenomena hitherto explained by a separate theory    Social visions are important in a number of ways The most obvious is that policies based on a certain vision of the world have consequences that spread through society and reverberate across the years or even across generations or centuries Visions set the agenda for both thought and action Visions fill in the necessarily large gaps in individual knowledge Thus for example an individual may act in one way in some area in which he has great knowledge but in just the opposite way elsewhere where he is relying on a vision he has never tested empirically A doctor may be a conservative on medical issues and a liberal on social and political issues or vice versa    The political battles of the day are a potpourri of special interests mass emotions personality clashes corruption and numerous other factors Yet the enduring historic trends have a certain consistency that reflects certain visions Often special interests prevail to the extent that they can mobilize support from the general publics responsiveness to visions which can be invoked for or against a given policy From the standpoint of personal motivation ideas may be simply the chips with which special interests demagogues and opportunists of various sorts play the political game But from a broader perspective of history these individuals and organizations can be viewed as simply carriers of ideas much as bees inadvertently carry pollenplaying a vital role in the grand scheme of nature while pursuing a much narrower individual purpose    The role of rationally articulated ideas may be quite modest in its effect on a given election a legislative vote or an action of a head of state Yet the    atmosphere in which such decisions take place may be dominated by a particular visionor by a particular conflict of visions Where intellectuals have played a role in history it has not been so much by whispering words of advice into the ears of political overlords as by contributing to the vast and powerful currents of conceptions and misconceptions that sweep human action along The effects of visions do not depend upon their being articulated or even on decisionmakers being aware of them Practical decisionmakers often disdain theories and visions being too busy to examine the ultimate basis on which they are acting However the object here will be precisely to examine the underlying social visions whose conflicts have shaped our times and may well shape times to come      Chapter 2    Constrained and Unconstrained Visions    At the core of every moral code there is a picture of human nature a map of the universe and a version of history To human nature of the sort conceived in a universe of the kind imagined after a history so understood the rules of the code apply  Walter Lippmann1            Social visions differ in their basic conceptions of the nature of man A creature from another galaxy who sought information about human beings from reading William Godwins Enquiry Concerning Political Justice in 1793 would hardly recognize man as he appears there as the same being who was described in The Federalist Papers just five years earlier The contrast would be only slightly less if he compared man as he appeared in Thomas Paine and in Edmund Burke or today in John Kenneth Galbraith and in Friedrich A Hayek Even the speculative prehistory of man as a wild creature in nature differs drastically between the free innocent being conceived by JeanJacques Rousseau and the brutal participant in the bloody war of each against all conceived by Thomas Hobbes    The capacities and limitations of man are implicitly seen in radically different terms by those whose explicit philosophical political or social theories are built on different visions Mans moral and mental natures are seen so differently that their respective concepts of knowledge and of institutions necessarily differ as well Social causation itself is conceived differently both as to mechanics and results Time and its ancillary phenomenatraditions contracts economic speculation for exampleare    also viewed quite differently in theories based on different visions The abstractions which are part of all theories tend to be viewed as more real by followers of some visions than by followers of opposing visions Finally those who believe in some visions view themselves in a very different moral role from the way that followers of other visions view themselves The ramifications of these conflicting visions extend into economic judicial military philosophical and political decisions    Rather than attempt the impossible task of following all these ramifications in each of the myriad of social visions the discussion here will group these visions into two broad categoriesthe constrained vision and the unconstrained vision These will be abstractions of convenience recognizing that there are degrees in both visions that a continuum has been dichotomized that in the real world there are often elements of each inconsistently grafted on to the other and innumerable combinations and permutations With all these caveats it is now possible to turn to an outline of the two visions and specifics on the nature of man the nature of knowledge and the nature of social processes as seen in constrained and unconstrained visions      THE NATURE OF MAN       The Constrained Vision     Adam Smith provided a picture of man which may help make concrete the nature of a constrained vision Writing as a philosopher in 1759 nearly twenty years before he became famous as an economist Smith said in his Theory of Moral Sentiments  Let us suppose that the great empire of China with all its myriads of inhabitants was suddenly swallowed up by an earthquake and let us consider how a man of humanity in Europe who had no sort of connection with that part of the world would react upon receiving intelligence of this dreadful calamity He would I imagine first of all express very strongly his sorrow for the misfortune of that unhappy people he would make many melancholy reflections upon the precariousness of human life and the vanity of all the labours of man which could thus be annihilated in a moment He would too perhaps if he was a man of speculation enter into many reasonings concerning the effects which this disaster might produce upon the commerce of Europe and the trade and business of the world in general And when all this fine philosophy was over when all these humane sentiments had been once fairly expressed he would pursue his business or his pleasure take his repose or his diversion with the same ease and tranquility as if no such accident had happened The most frivolous disaster which could befall himself would occasion a more real disturbance If he was to lose his little finger tomorrow he would not sleep tonight but provided he never saw them he would snore with the most profound security over the ruin of a hundred million of his brethren   2           The moral limitations of man in general and his egocentricity in particular were neither lamented by Smith nor regarded as things to be changed They were treated as inherent facts of life the basic constraint in his vision The fundamental moral and social challenge was to make the best of the possibilities which existed within that constraint rather than dissipate energies in an attempt to change human naturean attempt that Smith treated as both vain and pointless For example if it were somehow possible to make the European feel poignantly the full pain of those who suffered in China this state of mind would be perfectly useless according to Smith except to make him miserable3 without being of any benefit to the Chinese Smith said Nature it seems when she loaded us with our own sorrows thought that they were enough and therefore did not command us to take any further share in those of others than what was necessary to prompt us to relieve them4    Instead of regarding mans nature as something that could or should be changed Smith attempted to determine how the moral and social benefits desired could be produced in the most efficient way within that constraint Smith approached the production and distribution of moral behavior in much the same way he would later approach the production and distribution of material goods Although he was a professor of moral philosophy his thought processes were already those of an economist However the constrained vision is by no means limited to economists Smiths contemporary in politics Edmund Burke perhaps best summarized the constrained vision from a political perspective when he spoke of a radical infirmity in all human contrivances5 an infirmity inherent in the fundamental nature of things Similar views were expressed by Alexander Hamilton in The Federalist Papers  It is the lot of all human institutions even those of the most perfect kind to have defects as well as excellenciesill as well as good propensities This results from the imperfection of the Institutor Man6            Returning to Adam Smiths example a society cannot function humanely if at all when each person acts as if his little finger is more important than the lives of a hundred million other human beings But the crucial word here is act We cannot prefer ourselves so shamelessly and blindly to others when we act Adam Smith said7 even if that is the spontaneous or natural inclination of our feelings In practice people on many occasions sacrifice their own interests to the greater interests of others according to Smith8 but this was due to such intervening factors as devotion to moral principles to concepts of honor and nobility rather than to loving ones neighbor as oneself9    Through such artificial devices man could be persuaded to do for his own selfimage or inner needs what he would not do for the good of his fellow man In short such concepts were seen by Smith as the most efficient way to get the moral job done at the lowest psychic cost Despite the fact that this was a moral question Smiths answer was essentially economica system of moral incentives a set of tradeoffs rather than a real solution by changing man One of the hallmarks of the constrained vision is that it deals in tradeoffs rather than solutions    In his later classic work The Wealth of Nations Smith went further Economic benefits to society were largely unintended by individuals but emerged systemically from the interactions of the marketplace under the pressures of competition and the incentives of individual gain10 Moral sentiments were necessary only for shaping the general framework of laws within which this systemic process could go on    This was yet another way in which man with all the limitations conceived by Smith could be induced to produce benefits for others for reasons ultimately reducible to selfinterest It was not an atomistic theory that individual selfinterests added up to the interest of society On the contrary the functioning of the economy and society required each individual to do things for other people it was simply the motivation behind these actswhether moral or economicwhich was ultimately self    centered In both his moral and his economic analyses Smith relied on incentives rather than dispositions to get the job done      The Unconstrained Vision     Perhaps no other eighteenthcentury book presents such a contrast to the vision of man in Adam Smith as William Godwins Enquiry Concerning Political Justice a work as remarkable for its fate as for its contents An immediate success upon its publication in England in 1793 within a decade it encountered the chilling effect of British hostile reactions to ideas popularly associated with the French Revolution especially after France became an enemy in war By the time two decades of warfare between the two countries were ended at Waterloo Godwin and his work had been relegated to the periphery of intellectual life and he was subsequently best known for his influence on Shelley Yet no work from the eighteenth century age of reason so clearly so consistently and so systematically elaborated the unconstrained vision of man as did Godwins treatise    Where in Adam Smith moral and socially beneficial behavior could be evoked from man only by incentives in William Godwin mans understanding and disposition were capable of intentionally creating social benefits Godwin regarded the intention to benefit others as being of the essence of virtue11 and virtue in turn as being the road to human happiness Unintentional social benefits were treated by Godwin as scarcely worthy of notice12 His was the unconstrained vision of human nature in which man was capable of directly feeling other peoples needs as more important than his own and therefore of consistently acting impartially even when his own interests or those of his family were involved13 This was not meant as an empirical generalization about the way most people currently behaved It was meant as a statement of the underlying nature of human potential      Conceding current egocentric behavior did not imply that it was a permanent feature of human nature as human nature was conceived in the unconstrained vision Godwin said Men are capable no doubt of preferring an inferior interest of their own to a superior interest of others but this preference arises from a combination of circumstances and is not the necessary and invariable law of our nature14 Godwin referred to men as they hereafter may be made15 in contrast to Burkes view We cannot change the Nature of things and of menbut must act upon them the best we can16    Socially contrived incentives were disdained by Godwin as unworthy and unnecessary expedients when it was possible to achieve directly what Smiths incentives were designed to achieve indirectly If a thousand men are to be benefited I ought to recollect that I am only an atom in the comparison and to reason accordingly17 Unlike Smith who regarded human selfishness as a given Godwin regarded it as being promoted by the very system of rewards used to cope with it The real solution toward which efforts should be bent was to have people do what is right because it is right not because of psychic or economic payments that is not because someone has annexed to it a great weight of self interest18    Having an unconstrained vision of the yet untapped moral potential of human beings Godwin was not preoccupied like Smith with what is the most immediately effective incentive under the current state of things The real goal was the longrun development of a higher sense of social duty To the extent that immediately effective incentives retarded that longrun development their benefits were ephemeral or illusory The hope of reward and fear of punishment were in Godwins vision wrong in themselves and inimical to the improvement of the mind19 In this Godwin was seconded by another contemporary exemplar of the unconstrained vision the Marquis de Condorcet who rejected the whole idea of turning prejudices and vices to good account rather than trying to dispel or repress them Such mistakes Condorcet traced to his adversaries vision of human naturetheir confusing the natural man and    his potential with existing man corrupted by prejudices artificial passions and social customs20      TRADEOFFS VERSUS SOLUTIONS     Prudencethe careful weighing of tradeoffsis seen in very different terms within the constrained and the unconstrained visions In the constrained vision where tradeoffs are all that we can hope for prudence is among the highest duties Edmund Burke called it the first of all virtues21 Nothing is good Burke said but in proportion and with reference22in short as a tradeoff By contrast in the unconstrained vision where moral improvement has no fixed limit prudence is of a lower order of importance Godwin had little use for those moralistsquite conceivably meaning Smithwho think only of stimulating men to good deeds by considerations of frigid prudence and mercenary selfinterests instead of seeking to stimulate the generous and magnanimous sentiment of our natures23    Implicit in the unconstrained vision is the notion that the potential is very different from the actual and that means exist to improve human nature toward its potential or that such means can be evolved or discovered so that man will do the right thing for the right reason rather than for ulterior psychic or economic rewards Condorcet expressed a similar vision when he declared that man can eventually fulfill by a natural inclination the same duties which today cost him effort and sacrifice24 Thus a solution can supersede mere tradeoffs    Man is in short perfectiblemeaning continually improvable rather than capable of actually reaching absolute perfection We can come nearer and nearer according to Godwin25 though one cannot prescribe limits to this process26 It is sufficient for his purpose that men are eminently    capable of justice and virtue27not only isolated individuals but the whole species28 Efforts must be made to wake the sleeping virtues of mankind29 Rewarding existing behavior patterns was seen as antithetical to this goal    Here too Condorcet reached similar conclusions The perfectibility of man he said was truly indefinite30 The progress of the human mind was a recurring theme in Condorcet31 He acknowledged that there were limits of mans intelligence32 that no one believed it possible for man to know all the facts of nature or to attain the ultimate means of precision in their measurement or analysis33 But while there was ultimately a limit to mans mental capability according to Condorcet no one could specify what it was He was indignant that Locke dared to set a limit to human understanding34 As a devotee of mathematics Condorcet conceived perfectibility as a neverending asymptotic approach to a mathematical limit35    While use of the word perfectibility has faded away over the centuries the concept has survived largely intact to the present time The notion that the human being is highly plastic material36 is still central among many contemporary thinkers who share the unconstrained vision The concept of solution remains central to this vision A solution is achieved when it is no longer necessary to make a tradeoff even if the development of that solution entailed costs now past The goal of achieving a solution is in fact what justifies the initial sacrifices or transitional conditions which might otherwise be considered unacceptable Condorcet for example anticipated the eventual reconciliation the identification of the interests of each with the interests of allat which point the path of virtue is no longer arduous37 Man could act under the influence of a socially beneficial disposition rather than simply in response to ulterior incentives      SOCIAL MORALITY AND SOCIAL CAUSATION     Human actions were dichotomized by Godwin into the beneficial and the harmful and each of these in turn was dichotomized into the intentional and the unintentional The intentional creation of benefits was called virtue38 the intentional creation of harm was vice39 and the unintentional creation of harm was negligence a subspecies of vice40 These definitions can be represented schematically         BENEFICIAL HARMFUL INTENTIONAL Virtue Vice  UNINTENTIONAL Negligence         The missing category was unintentional benefit It was precisely this missing category in Godwin that was central to Adam Smiths whole vision particularly as it unfolded in his classic work The Wealth of Nations The economic benefits to society produced by the capitalist were according to Smith no part of his intention41 The capitalists intentions were characterized by Smith as mean rapacity42 and capitalists as a group were referred to as people who seldom meet together even for merriment or diversion but the conversation ends in a conspiracy against the public or in    some contrivance to raise prices43 Yet despite his repeatedly negative depictions of capitalists44 unrivaled among economists until Karl Marx Adam Smith nevertheless became the patron saint of laissezfaire capitalism Intentions which were crucial in the unconstrained vision of Godwin were irrelevant in the constrained vision of Smith What mattered to Smith were the systemic characteristics of a competitive economy which he saw as producing social benefits from unsavory individual intentions    While Adam Smith and William Godwin have been cited as especially clear and straightforward writers espousing opposing visions each is part of a vast tradition that continues powerful and contending for domination today Even among their contemporaries Smith and Godwin each had many intellectual compatriots with similar visions differently expressed and differing in details and degree Edmund Burkes Reflections on the Revolution in France in 1790 was perhaps the most ringing polemical application of the constrained vision Thomas Paines equally polemical reply The Rights of Man 1791 anticipated in many ways the more systematic unfolding of the unconstrained vision by Godwin two years later    Godwin credited Rousseau with being the first to teach that the imperfections of government were the only perennial source of the vices of mankind45 Rousseau was certainly the most famous of those who argued on the basis of a human nature not inherently constrained to its existing limitations but narrowed and corrupted by social institutionsa vision also found in Condorcet and in Baron DHolbach among others of that era In the nineteenth century John Stuart Mill said that the present wretched education and wretched social arrangements were the only real hindrance to attaining general happiness among human beings46 Mills most ringing rhetoric reflected the unconstrained vision though his eclecticism in many areas caused him to include devastating provisos more consonant with the constrained vision47    Much of nineteenthcentury and twentiethcentury liberalism in the American sense builds upon these foundations modified and varying in    degree and applied to areas as disparate as education war and criminal justice Marxism as we shall see was a special hybrid applying a constrained vision to much of the past and an unconstrained vision to much of the future    When Harold Laski said that dissatisfaction was an expression of serious ill in the body politic48 he was expressing the essence of the unconstrained vision in which neither man nor nature have such inherent constraints as to disappoint our hopes so that existing institutions traditions or rulers must be responsible for dissatisfaction Conversely when Malthus attributed human misery to laws inherent in the nature of man and absolutely independent of all human regulations49 he was expressing one of the most extreme forms of the constrained vision encompassing inherent constraints in both nature and man    Godwins reply to Malthus not surprisingly applied the unconstrained vision to both nature and man Men are born into the world in every country where the cultivation of the earth is practised with the natural faculty in each man of producing more food than he can consume a faculty which cannot be controlled but by the injurious exclusions of human institution50 Given the unconstrained possibilities of man and nature poverty or other sources of dissatisfaction could only be a result of evil intentions or blindness to solutions readily achievable by changing existing institutions    By contrast Burke considered complaints about our times and rulers to be part of the general infirmities of human nature and that true political sagacity was required to separate these perennial complaints from real indicators of a special malaise51 Hobbes went even further arguing that it was precisely when men are at ease that they are most troublesome politically52    The constraints of nature are themselves important largely through the constraints of human nature The inherent natural constraint of the need for    food for example becomes a practical social problem only insofar as human beings multiply to the point where subsistence becomes difficult to achieve for a growing population Thus this central constraint of nature in Malthus becomes socially important only because of Malthus highly constrained vision of human nature which he saw as inevitably behaving in such a way as to populate the earth to that point But Godwin who readily conceded the natural constraint had a very different vision of human nature which would not needlessly overpopulate Therefore the possibility of a geometrical increase in people was of no concern to Godwin because possible men do not eat though real men do53    Malthus on the other hand saw overpopulation not as an abstract possibility in the future but as a concrete reality already manifested According to Malthus the period when the number of men surpass their means of subsistence has long since arrived    has existed ever since we have had any histories of mankind does exist at present and will for ever continue to exist54 It would be hard to conceive of a more absolute statement of a constrained vision Where Malthus and Godwin differed was not over a natural factthe need for foodbut over behavioral theories based on very different visions of human nature Most followers of the unconstrained vision likewise acknowledge death for example as an inherent constraint of nature though Godwin and Condorcet did not rule out an eventual conquest of death but simply do not treat this as a constraint on the social development of mankind which lives on despite the deaths of individuals    The great evils of the worldwar poverty and crime for exampleare seen in completely different terms by those with the constrained and the unconstrained visions If human options are not inherently constrained then the presence of such repugnant and disastrous phenomena virtually cries out for explanationand for solutions But if the limitations and passions of man himself are at the heart of these painful phenomena then what requires explanation are the ways in which they have been avoided or minimized While believers in the unconstrained vision seek the special causes of war poverty and crime believers in the constrained vision seek the special    causes of peace wealth or a lawabiding society In the unconstrained vision there are no intractable reasons for social evils and therefore no reason why they cannot be solved with sufficient moral commitment But in the constrained vision whatever artifices or strategies restrain or ameliorate inherent human evils will themselves have costs some in the form of other social ills created by these civilizing institutions so that all that is possible is a prudent tradeoff    The two great revolutions in the eighteenth centuryin France and in Americacan be viewed as applications of these differing visions though with all the reservations necessary whenever the flesh and blood of complex historical events are compared to skeletal theoretical models The underlying premises of the French Revolution more clearly reflected the unconstrained vision of man which prevailed among its leaders The intellectual foundations of the American Revolution were more mixed including men like Thomas Paine and Thomas Jefferson whose thinking was similar in many ways to that in France but also including as a dominant influence on the Constitution the classic constrained vision of man expressed in The Federalist Papers Where Robespierre looked forward to the end of revolutionary bloodshed when all people will have become equally devoted to their country and its laws55 Alexander Hamilton in The Federalist Papers regarded the idea of individual actions unbiased by considerations not connected with the public good as a prospect more ardently to be wished than seriously to be expected56 Robespierre sought a solution Hamilton a tradeoff    The Constitution of the United States with its elaborate checks and balances clearly reflected the view that no one was ever to be completely trusted with power This was in sharp contrast to the French Revolution which gave sweeping powers including the power of life and death to those who spoke in the name of the people expressing the Rousseauean general will Even when bitterly disappointed with particular leaders who were then deposed and executed believers in this vision did not substantially change their political systems or beliefs viewing the evil as localized in individuals who had betrayed the revolution       The writers of The Federalist Papers were quite conscious of the vision of man that underlay the Constitution of checks and balances which they espoused  It may be a reflection on human nature that such devices should be necessary to control the abuses of government But what is government itself but the greatest of all reflections on human nature57          To the Federalists the evil was inherent in man and institutions were simply ways of trying to cope with it Adam Smith likewise saw government as an imperfect remedy for the deficiency of wisdom and virtue in man58 The Federalist Papers said  Why has government been instituted at all Because the passions of men will not conform to the dictates of reason and justice without constraint59          To those without this constrained vision of man the whole elaborate system of constitutional checks and balances was a needless complication and impediment Condorcet condemned such counterweights for creating an overcomplicated political machine to weigh upon the people60 He saw no need for society to be jostled between opposing powers61 or held back by the inertia of constitutional checks and balances62    The constrained vision is a tragic vision of the human condition The unconstrained vision is a moral vision of human intentions which are viewed as ultimately decisive The unconstrained vision promotes pursuit of the highest ideals and the best solutions By contrast the constrained vision sees the best as the enemy of the gooda vain attempt to reach the    unattainable being seen as not only futile but often counterproductive while the same efforts could have produced a more viable and beneficial tradeoff Adam Smith applied this reasoning not only to economics but also to morality and politics The prudent reformer according to Smith will respect the confirmed habits and prejudices of the people and when he cannot establish what is right he will not disdain to ameliorate the wrong His goal is not to create the ideal but to establish the best that the people can bear63    But Condorcet expressing the unconstrained vision rejected any notion that laws should change with the temperature and adapt to the forms of government to the practices that superstition has consecrated and even to the stupidities adopted by each people   64 Thus he found the French Revolution superior to the American Revolution for the principles from which the constitution and laws of France were derived were purer and allowed the people to exercise their sovereign right without constraint65 Related to this is the question whether the institutions of one society can be transferred to another or particular blueprints for better societies be applied to very different countries Jeremy Bentham was noted for producing both specific reforms and general principles intended to apply in very different societies Yet to Hamilton What may be good at Philadelphia may be bad at Paris and ridiculous at Petersburgh66 Each of these conclusions is consistent with the respective vision from which it came    While the constrained vision sees human nature as essentially unchanged across the ages and around the world the particular cultural expressions of human needs peculiar to specific societies are not seen as being readily and beneficially changeable by forcible intervention By contrast those with the unconstrained vision tend to view human nature as beneficially changeable and social customs as expendable holdovers from the past    Ideals are weighed against the cost of achieving them in the constrained vision But in the unconstrained vision every closer approximation to the ideal should be preferred Costs are regrettable but by no means decisive Thomas Jeffersons reply to those who turned against the French    Revolution because of the innocent people it had killed exemplified this point  My own affections have been deeply wounded by some of the martyrs to this cause but rather than it should have failed I would have seen half the earth desolated67          Belief in the irrelevance of process costs in the pursuit of social justice could hardly have been expressed more clearly or categorically Yet in the end Jefferson too turned against the French Revolution as its human cost increased beyond what he could continue to accept Jefferson was not completely or irrevocably committed to the unconstrained vision    The relative importance of process costs has continued over the centuries to distinguish the constrained and the unconstrained visions Modern defenders of legal technicalities which allow criminals to escape punishment who declare That is the price we pay for freedom or defenders of revolutions who say You cant make omelettes without breaking eggs are contemporary exemplars of an unconstrained vision which has historically treated process costs as secondary At the other end of the philosophical spectrum are those who in essence repeat Adam Smiths view of process costs The peace and order of society is of more importance than even the relief of the miserable68 The continuing battle between ideals and the costs of achieving them is only one part of the ongoing conflict of visions      SUMMARY AND IMPLICATIONS     Visions rest ultimately on some sense of the nature of mannot simply his existing practices but his ultimate potential and ultimate limitations Those who see the potentialities of human nature as extending far beyond what is currently manifested have a social vision quite different from those who see human beings as tragically limited creatures whose selfish and dangerous impulses can be contained only by social contrivances which themselves produce unhappy side effects William Godwin and Adam Smith are two of the clearest and most consistent exemplars of these respective social visions the unconstrained and the constrained Yet they are neither the first nor the last in these two long traditions of social thought    When Rousseau said that man is born free but is everywhere in chains69 he expressed the essence of the unconstrained vision in which the fundamental problem is not nature or man but institutions According to Rousseau men are not naturally enemies70 The diametrically opposite vision was presented in Hobbes Leviathan where the armed power of political institutions was all that prevented the war of each against all71 that would otherwise exist among men in their natural state where life would be solitary poore nasty brutish and short72 While the unconstrained vision of Condorcet led him to seek a society in which mans natural inclination would coincide with the social good73 Hayeks constrained vision led to the conclusion that the indispensable rules of the free society require from us much that is unpleasant74that is mans nature inherently could not coincide with the social good but must be deliberately subordinated to it despite the unpleasantness which this entailed      Given the wider capabilities of man in the unconstrained vision the intentions which guide those capabilities are especially important Words and concepts which revolve around intentionsincerity commitment dedicationhave been central to discussions within the framework of the unconstrained vision for centuries and the policies sought by this vision have often been described in terms of their intended goals Liberty equality fraternity ending the exploitation of man by man or social justice for example But in the constrained vision where mans ability to directly consummate his intentions is very limited intentions mean far less Burke referred to the Beneficial effects of human faults and to the ill consequences attending the most undoubted Virtues75 Adam Smiths entire economic doctrine of laissezfaire implicitly assumed the same lack of correspondence between intention and effect for the systemic benefits of capitalism were no part of the intention of capitalists    In the constrained vision social processes are described not in terms of intentions or ultimate goals but in terms of the systemic characteristics deemed necessary to contribute to those goalsproperty rights free enterprise or strict construction of the Constitution for example It is not merely that there are different goals in the two visions but more fundamentally that the goals relate to different things The unconstrained vision speaks directly in terms of desired results the constrained vision in terms of process characteristics considered conducive to desired results but not directly or without many unhappy side effects which are accepted as part of a tradeoff    With all the complex differences among social thinkers as of a given time and still more so over time it is nevertheless possible to recognize certain key assumptions about human nature and about social causation which permit some to be grouped together as belonging to the constrained vision and others as belonging to the unconstrained vision Although these groupings do not encompass all social theorists they cover many important figures and enduring ideological conflicts of the past two centuries      Running through the tradition of the unconstrained vision is the conviction that foolish or immoral choices explain the evils of the world and that wiser or more moral and humane social policies are the solution William Godwins elaboration of this unconstrained vision in his Enquiry Concerning Political Justice drew upon and systematized such ideas found among numerous eighteenthcentury thinkersJeanJacques Rousseau Voltaire Condorcet Thomas Paine and Holbach being notable examples This general approach was carried forth in the nineteenth century in their very different ways by SaintSimon Robert Owen and by George Bernard Shaw and other Fabians Its twentiethcentury echoes are found in political theorists such as Harold Laski in economists like Thorstein Veblen and John Kenneth Galbraith and in the law with a whole school of advocates of judicial activism epitomized by Ronald Dworkin in theory and Earl Warren in practice    By contrast the constrained vision sees the evils of the world as deriving from the limited and unhappy choices available given the inherent moral and intellectual limitations of human beings For amelioration of these evils and the promotion of progress they rely on the systemic characteristics of certain social processes such as moral traditions the marketplace or families They conceive of these processes as evolved rather than designed and rely on these general patterns of social interaction rather than on specific policy designed to directly produce particular results for particular individuals or groups This constrained view of human capacities found in Adam Smith is also found in a long series of other social thinkers ranging from Thomas Hobbes in the seventeenth century through Edmund Burke and the authors of The Federalist Papers among Smiths contemporaries through such twentiethcentury figures as Oliver Wendell Holmes in law Milton Friedman in economics and Friedrich A Hayek in general social theory    Not all social thinkers fit this schematic dichotomy John Stuart Mill and Karl Marx for example do not fit for very different reasons as will be noted in Chapter 5 Others take midway positions between the two visions or convert from one to the other However the conflict of visions is no less    real because everyone has not chosen sides or irrevocably committed themselves    Despite necessary caveats it remains an important and remarkable phenomenon that how human nature is conceived at the outset is highly correlated with the whole conception of knowledge morality power time rationality war freedom and law which defines a social vision These correlations will be explored in the chapters that follow    Because various beliefs theories and systems of social thought are spread across a continuum perhaps even a multidimensional continuum it might in one sense be more appropriate to refer to less constrained visions and more constrained visions instead of the dichotomy used here However the dichotomy is not only more convenient but also captures an important distinction Virtually no one believes that man is 100 percent unconstrained and virtually no one believes that man is 100 percent constrained What puts a given thinker in the tradition of one vision rather than the other is not simply whether he refers more to mans constraints or to his untapped potential but whether or to what extent constraints are built into the very structure and operation of a particular theory Those whose theories incorporate these constraints as a central feature have a constrained vision those whose theories do not make these constraints an integral or central part of the analysis have an unconstrained vision Every vision by definition leaves something outindeed leaves most things out The dichotomy between constrained and unconstrained visions is based on whether or not inherent limitations of man are among the key elements included in the vision    The dichotomy is justified in yet another sense These different ways of conceiving man and the world lead not merely to different conclusions but to sharply divergent often diametrically opposed conclusions on issues ranging from justice to war There are not merely differences of visions but conflicts of visions      Chapter 3    Visions of Knowledge and Reason    The constrained and the unconstrained visions tend to differ in their very definition of knowledge as well as in their conceptions of its quantity concentration or dispersal and its role in the social process Reason likewise takes on entirely different meanings in the two visions      THE MOBILIZATION OF KNOWLEDGE       The Constrained Vision     In the constrained vision any individuals own knowledge alone is grossly inadequate for social decisionmaking and often even for his own personal decisions A complex society and its progress are therefore possible only because of numerous social arrangements which transmit and coordinate knowledge from a tremendous range of contemporaries as well as from the even more vast numbers of those from generations past Knowledge as conceived in the constrained vision is predominantly experience transmitted socially in largely inarticulate forms from prices which indicate costs scarcities and preferences to traditions which evolve from the day today experiences of millions in each generation winnowing out in Darwinian competition what works from what does not work Friedrich A Hayek expressed this view when he said  The growth of knowledge and the growth of civilization are the same only if we interpret knowledge to include all the human adaptations to environment in which past experience has been incorporated Not all knowledge in this sense is part of our intellect nor is our intellect the whole of our knowledge Our habits and skills our emotional attitudes our tools and our institutionsall are in this sense adaptations to past experience which have grown up by selective elimination of less suitable conduct They are as much an indispensable foundation of successful action as is our conscious knowledge1         In this vision it is not simply that individuals rationally choose what works from what does not work but alsoand more fundamentallythat the competition of institutions and whole societies leads to a general survival of more effective collections of cultural traits even if neither the    winners nor the losers rationally understand what was better or worse about one set or the other Values which may be effective at the tribal level will tend to be overwhelmed by values that permit or promote the functioning of larger aggregations of people From this perspective man has certainly more often learnt to do the right thing without comprehending why it was the right thing and he still is better served by custom than understanding There is thus more intelligence incorporated in the system of rules of conduct than in mans thoughts about his surroundings2    Knowledge is thus the social experience of the many as embodied in behavior sentiments and habits rather than the specially articulated reason of the few however talented or gifted those few might be When knowledge is conceived as social experience rather than solitary excogitation then a very small part is gained in the closet according to Hamilton3    In Burkes words We are afraid to put men to live and trade each on his own private stock of reason because we suspect that this stock in each man is small and that the individuals would do better to avail themselves of the general bank and capital of nations and of ages4 By reason Burke did not mean simply the written words of notable individuals but the whole experience of peoples summarized in the feelings formalities and even prejudices embodied in their culture and behavior These cultural distillations of knowledge were not considered infallible or immutable which would have been a solution instead of a tradeoffbut rather as a tested body of experience that worked and which was to be changed only after the most circumspect and perhaps even reluctant examination We should attend to the defects of the social order according to Burke with the same trepidation with which we would tend the wounds of our father5 They are not to be ignored but neither are they a mandate for experiment or hasty inspiration With no examination whatever there would be no evolutionary process and therefore in this vision no basis for the confidence in tradition and enduring institutions which was the hallmark of Burke and to varying degrees of other believers in a constrained vision      The tradeoff perspective of the constrained vision treats defects as inevitable and therefore not in themselves reason for change unless their magnitudes merit the inevitable costs entailed by change Preserving my principles unshaken Burke said I reserve my activity for rational endeavours6 On another occasion he said I must bear with infirmities until they fester into crimes7 This was not a mere verbal patina on apathetic drift as shown by Burkes own relentless prosecution of Warren Hastings for alleged misconduct in his governance of India or Burkes unpopular stand in Parliament for freeing the rebellious American colonies or his antislavery proposals8 Adam Smith likewise urged the freeing of the American coloniesand other colonies as wellin addition to suggesting a number of domestic reforms and being opposed to slavery9 In America the men who wrote The Federalist PapersAlexander Hamilton James Madison and John Jayfirst came to public notice as leaders in the revolt against British rule The constrained vision was not synonymous with or camouflage for acceptance of the status quo      The Unconstrained Vision     The unconstrained vision had no such limited view of human knowledge or of its application through reason It was the eighteenthcentury exemplars of the unconstrained vision who created the age of reason as expressed in the title of Thomas Paines famous book of that era Reason was as paramount in their vision as experience was in the constrained vision According to Godwin experience was greatly overratedunreasonably magnified in his wordscompared to reason or to the general power of a cultivated mind10 Therefore the wisdom of the ages was seen by Godwin as largely the illusions of the ignorant The age of a belief or practice did not exempt it from the crucial test of validation in specifically articulated terms In Godwins words we must bring everything to the standard of reason He added  Nothing must be sustained because it is ancient because we have been accustomed to regard it as sacred or because it has been unusual to bring its validity into question11         Similarly according to Condorcet everything that bears the imprint of time must inspire distrust more than respect12 It was only by meditation Condorcet said that we can arrive at any general truths in the science of man13    Given the ability of a cultivated mind to apply reason directly to the facts at hand there was no necessity to defer to the unarticulated systemic processes of the constrained vision as expressed in the collective wisdom derived from the past The pretense of collective wisdom is the most    palpable of all impostures according to Godwin14 Validation was not to be indirect collective and systemic but direct individual and intentional Articulated rationality was to be the mode of validation not general acceptance based on pragmatic experience According to Godwin persons of narrow views and observation readily accept whatever happens to prevail in their society15 Therefore this cannot be the method by which to decide issues    Implicit in the unconstrained vision is a profound inequality between the conclusions of persons of narrow views and those with cultivated minds From this it follows that progress involves raising the level of the former to that of the latter According to Godwin  Real intellectual improvement demands that mind should as speedily as possible be advanced to the height of knowledge already existing among the enlightened members of the community and start from thence in pursuit of further acquisitions16          Also implicit in the unconstrained vision is the view that the relevant comparison is between the beliefs of one sort of person and another between x and y rather than between 1 systemic processes working through successive generations of individuals a through x as expressed through the living generation x versus 2 the articulated rationality of y in isolation The rejection of the concept of collective wisdom leaves individual comparisons as the standard of judgment Since the experiences of a through w no longer count the issue reduces to the articulated rationality of x versus that of y Therefore the unconstrained vision necessarily favors the cultivated mind y while the constrained vision necessarily favors the views expressed through x seen as representative of the unarticulated experience of many others a through w The two visions thus lead to opposite conclusions as to which opinion should prevail and why      Burke clearly saw himself in the role of x rather than y  I give you opinions which have been accepted amongst us from very early times to this moment with a continued and general approbation and which indeed are so worked into my mind that I am unable to distinguish what I have learned from others from the results of my own meditations17          The kind of knowledge or understanding referred to by Burke was conceived as a common fund in which he participated That of Godwin was the knowledge or understanding of cultivated mindsa knowledge which by its nature was concentrated in a few rather than dispersed among the many The very meaning of knowledge was also different which is why it was distributed so differently in the two visions In the constrained vision where knowledge was a multiplicity of experience too complex for explicit articulation it was distilled over the generations in cultural processes and traits so deeply embedded as to be virtually unconscious reflexeswidely shared This was in Burkes words wisdom without reflection18    Wisdom without reflection was a concept utterly foreign to the unconstrained vision in which human beings have both the capacity and the obligation to exercise explicit reason on all issues Reason according to Godwin is the proper instrument and the sufficient instrument for regulating the actions of mankind19 Passions and biases may exist but if we employ our rational faculties we cannot fail of thus conquering our erroneous propensities20    Given that explicitly articulated knowledge is special and concentrated in the unconstrained vision the best conduct of social activities depends upon the special knowledge of the few being used to guide the actions of the many What is needed is to infuse just views of society into the liberally educated and reflecting members of society who in turn will be to the people guides and instructors according to Godwin21 This idea    was by no means peculiar to Godwin but rather has been a central and enduring theme of the unconstrained vision Along with it has often gone a vision of intellectuals as disinterested advisors Voltaire declared the philosophers having no particular interest to defend can only speak up in favor of reason and the public interest22 Condorcet likewise referred to truly enlightened philosophers strangers to ambition23 Rousseau considered it the best and most natural arrangement for the wisest to govern the multitude24 Even if nonintellectuals run the actual machinery of government according to DAlembert the greatest happiness of a nation is realized when those who govern agree with those who instruct it25    These eighteenthcentury themes were repeated with at least equal vigor by John Stuart Mill in the nineteenth century To Mill a special role was reserved for the most cultivated intellects in the country26 for thinking minds27 for the best and the wisest28 for the really superior intellects and characters29 Much could be accomplished if the superior spirits would but join with each other30 if the universities would send forth a succession of minds not the creatures of their age but capable of being its improvers and regenerators31 Similar prescriptions remain common today In short the special role of thinking people or of the brightest and the best has for centuries been a central theme of the unconstrained vision    For those with the constrained vision however a special role for intellectuals in the running of society has long been seen as a grave danger In Burkes words  Happy if learning not debauched by ambition had been satisfied to continue the instructor and not aspired to be the master32          John Randolph was likewise repelled by the idea of professors in a university turned statesmen33 In a similar vein Hobbes regarded    universities as places where fashionable but insignificant words flourished34 and added that there is nothing so absurd but may be found in the books of Philosophers35    The central danger as seen by those with the constrained vision is the intellectuals narrow conception of what constitutes knowledge and wisdom They are in Burkes words endeavouring to confine the reputation of sense learning and taste to themselves or their following and are capable of carrying the intolerance of the tongue and of the pen into a persecution of others36 Adam Smith spoke of the doctrinaire man of system who is wise in his own conceit and who seems to imagine that he can arrange the different members of a great society with as much ease as the hand arranges the different pieces upon a chessboard37 The whole notion of a philosopherking was abhorrent to Smith who declared that of all political speculators sovereign princes are by far the most dangerous38    The superiority of experts within a narrow slice of the vast spectrum of human understanding was not denied What was denied was that this expertise conferred a general superiority which should supersede more widely dispersed kinds of knowledge It may be admitted that as far as scientific knowledge is concerned a body of suitably chosen experts may be in the best position to command all the best knowledge available according to Hayek But he added with respect to other kinds of knowledge practically every individual has some advantage over all others because he possesses unique information of which beneficial use might be made but of which use can be made only if the decisions depending on it are left to him or are made with his active cooperation39 With knowledge conceived of as both fragmented and widely dispersed systemic coordination among the many supersedes the special wisdom of the few    Nor was this systemic coordination to be planned or imposed by the wise few It was an evolved natural order in the phrase of one of the eighteenth    century Physiocrats40 the group who coined the expression laissezfaire The same kind of reasoning was found in Adam Smith the most famous exponent of this doctrine  The statesman who should attempt to direct people in what manner they ought to employ their capitals would not only load himself with a most unnecessary attention but assume an authority which could safely be trusted not only to no single person but to no council or senate whatever and which would nowhere be so dangerous as in the hands of a man who had folly and presumption enough to fancy himself fit to exercise it41          The marketplace was only one of a number of evolved systemic processes for making decisions The family languages and traditions are other examples among many Believers in the constrained vision rely heavily on such processes to make better decisions than any given individual could make however talented or knowledgeable compared to other individuals    In short starting from different conceptions of how much a given individual can know and understand the constrained and the unconstrained visions arrive at opposite conclusions as to whether the best social decisions are to be made by those with the most individual knowledge of a special kind or by systemic processes that mobilize and coordinate knowledge scattered among the many in individually unimpressive amounts      ARTICULATED VERSUS SYSTEMIC RATIONALITY     The power of specifically articulated rationality is central to the unconstrained vision The power of unarticulated social processes to mobilize and coordinate knowledge is central to the constrained vision    In the unconstrained vision to act without explicit reason is to act on prepossession and prejudice42 According to Godwin Discussion is the path that leads to discovery and demonstration43 Accuracy of language is the indispensable prerequisite of sound knowledge44 in Godwins vision where knowledge is synonymous with articulated rationality Virtue is promoted when men must avow their actions and assign the reasons upon which they are founded45 If we could render the plain dictates of justice level to every capacity according to Godwin we may expect the whole species to become reasonable and virtuous46 To Condorcet as well the task is to render common to almost every man those principles of strict and unsullied justice47    Reason has at least two very different meanings One is a causeand effect meaning There is a reason why water expands when it freezes into ice even though most of us who are not physicists do not know what that reason isand at one time no one knew the reason The other meaning of reason is articulated specification of causation or logic When it is demanded that individuals or society justify their actions before the bar of reason this is what is meant The more constrained ones vision of human capabilities and potential the greater the difference between these two meanings Everything may have a cause and yet human beings may be    unable to specify what it is Since no theory is literally unconstrained entirely there is always some awareness of the difference between the two meanings of reason    Conversely no theory is so constrained that man can understand nothing which would imply a total lack of overlap between the two meanings of reason But at the more unconstrained end of the spectrum the overlap between the two concepts is considered to be so great that to say that a reason exists is virtually to say that we can specify it At the very least our decisionmaking must proceed on the basis of those reasons which we can specify But at the more constrained end of the spectrum knowledge and reasons unknown to any given individual must be brought to bear on many decisions through social processes in which articulated rationality plays at best a subordinate role    Classical and neoclassical economics especially of the Austrian school exemplify this constrained vision of systemic rationality in which individual articulation means little In an uncontrolled market as seen in this vision changing prices wages and interest rates adjust the economy to shifting demands technological changes and evolving skillswithout any of the actors in this drama knowing or caring how his individual responses affect the whole It can be analyzed as a general process of interaction with its own characteristic patterns and resultsotherwise there would be no Austrian economicsbut cannot be specified in such concrete detail as to make it feasible for any individual or group to plan or control the actual process The rationality in it is systemic not individualand such individual rationality as may exist is largely incidental so that the much vexed question as to just how rational man is has little relevance in this vision48    A similar difference between individual and systemic rationality can be found in religious doctrines in which 1 the Deity is conceived to act directly to affect natural and human phenomena versus 2 those in which a Providential systemic process makes life possible and beneficent without requiring Divine superintendence of details49 What both the secular and the    religious versions of systemic processes have in common is that the wisdom of the individual human actor is not the wisdom of the drama Conversely there are both secular and religious versions of individual rationality the religious version being one in which the Deity directly decides on individual events from daily weather changes to deaths of individuals Fundamentalist religion is the most pervasive vision of central planning though many fundamentalists may oppose human central planning as a usurpation or playing God This is consistent with the fundamentalist vision of an unconstrained God and a highly constrained man      Law     The two visions conflict in law as well as in economics and religion Oliver Wendell Holmes expressed the systemic concept when he declared The life of the law has not been logic it has been experience50 Articulation was not essential to decisionmaking for many honorable and sensible judgments express an intuition of experience which outruns analysis and sums up many unnamed and tangled impressions impressions which may lie beneath consciousness without losing their worth51 Law incorporates the experience that reflects not only our own lives but the lives of all men that have been according to Holmes52 It is a fallacy to conceive of law as purely a process of articulated logic for while it is true in the broadest sense that the law is a logical development it is not worked out like mathematics from general axioms of conduct53 In short the logic of the laws development is a systemic logic  The development of our law has gone on for nearly a thousand years like the development of a planet each generation taking the next step mind like matter simply obeying a law of spontaneous growth54         John Stuart Mill however objected that laws are made not evolved What those with the constrained vision characterized as a spontaneous order evolving from history was merely the fortuitous concourse of atoms in ages of barbarism according to Mill55 He said  The laws of Moses those of Mahomet were made and did not grow they had it is true the direct sanction of religious faith but the laws of    Lycurgus the laws of Solon were made and were as durable as any laws which grew have hitherto been found56          To look at legal precedents was in Mills view to make an absurd sacrifice of present ends to antiquated means57    Yet as in other areas Mills assertions were modified if not repealed by his provisos Those who make law have according to Mill taken into account what the people will bear and that is a function of their ancient habits or of their durable and strenuous convictions without which the whole system of laws would become inoperative The acquiescence of mankind thus depends upon the preservation of something like continuity of existence in institutions representing those innumerable compromises between adverse interests and expectations without which no government could be carried on a year and with difficulty even for a week58 With these provisos included Mills position is not very far from that to which it seems at first to be the very opposite namely that all the famous early law givers as Hayek put it did not intend to create new law but merely to state what law was and had always been59 That is it was largely the articulation of previously existing practice according to Hayek60    Many modern writers on law represent the unconstrained vision much more unambiguously than Mill For example Ronald Dworkin dismisses the silly faith that ethics as well as economics moves by an invisible hand so that individual rights and the general good will coalesce and law based on principle will move the nation to a frictionless utopia where everyone is better off than he was before61    These different visions applied to the law lead to opposite conclusions regarding judicial activism The unconstrained vision as applied by Dworkin calls for an activist court to read its own meanings into the words of the Constitution62 In this he is by no means alone either in his    conclusions or in the methods used to reach them His call for a fusion of constitutional law and moral theory63 for fresh moral insight64 has been one among many65    Oliver Wendell Holmes conception of the law left no such room for judicial activism  It is dangerous to tie down legislatures too closely by judicial constructions not necessarily arising from the words of the Constitution66          Nor was it merely the words but rather the original meanings of those words that were to be adhered to He refused to declare unconstitutional under the Fourteenth Amendment methods of taxation which were well known when that Amendment was adopted67 He later spoke of the more than anxiety that I feel at the everincreasing scope given to the Fourteenth Amendment68 In yet another case he saw no reason for reading into the Sherman Act more than we find there69    As in other clashes between the two visions the issue is posed very differently by each side Those with the unconstrained vision favoring articulated rationality see the issue as one between two sets of contemporaries x and y while those with a constrained vision favoring systemic processes see the issue as being between the experience of successive generations represented by group x in todays generation versus the articulated rationality of their contemporary opponents group y    Insofar as those with the unconstrained vision acknowledge prior generations they see the issue as being between some given prior generationsay generation hand the current generations group y This is dismissed as a conflict between the living and the dead in which the dead have no right to rule beyond the grave70 From this perspective we must    use our own reasoned and revocable will not some idealized ancestral compulsion71 to advance Alternatively the conditions of prior times are deemed irrelevant or less relevant than current views based on current conditions Chief Justice Earl Warren for example spoke of contemporary circumstances far beyond the wisdom of even the wisest of the Founding Fathers72    But when Oliver Wendell Holmes characterized the law as summarizing not only our own lives but the lives of all men that have been he clearly rejected any notion that the clash was between opposing groups in one generation or even between one contemporary group and one past group such as the Founding Fathers Rather the clash was conceived as being between two whole processes one of historical experience over many generations versus the articulated rationality of one contemporary school of thought Neither Holmes nor others who argued for systemic processes seriously contest the claims of intellectual andor moral superiority which are central to the articulated rationality and social justice of those with the unconstrained vision With the constrained vision the issue is not whether one individual or group is wiser than another but whether systemic experience is wiser than both    Yet those who argue for deliberate lawmaking through judicial activism do so not on the basis of having a democratic majority even in the given generation but rather of having an intellectually and morally superior process for decisionmaking When Dworkin dismissed the opposing process as a silly faith a pessimistic theory of human nature73 the curious philosophy of Edmund Burke74 and the chaotic and unprincipled development of history75 this was a prelude to asserting a superiority competent to override a democratic majority of contemporaries quite aside from dismissing prior generations For Dworkin a more equal society is a better society even if its citizens prefer inequality76      Social Policy     The two visions entail very different views of the relationship between members of the existing society The unconstrained vision has tended historically toward creating more equalized economic and social conditions in society even if the means chosen imply great inequality in the right to decide such issues and choose such means Clearly only very unequal intellectual and moral standing could justify having equality imposed whether the people want it or not as Dworkin suggests and only very unequal power would make it possible It is consistent for the unconstrained vision to promote equalitarian ends by unequalitarian means given the great differences between those whom Mill called the wisest and best and those who have not yet reached that intellectual and moral level    Conversely those with the constrained vision have tended to be less concerned with promoting economic and social equality but more concerned with the dangers of an inequality of power producing an articulate ruling elite of rationalists In Hayeks words  The most dangerous state in the growth of civilization may well be that in which man has come to regard all these beliefs as superstitions and refuses to accept or to submit to anything which he does not rationally understand The rationalist whose reason is not sufficient to teach him those limitations of the power of conscious reason and who despises all the institutions and customs which have not been consciously designed would thus become the destroyer of the civilization built upon them77            The clash over judicial activism reflects a much more general clash over the best way to contribute to the social good In the unconstrained vision wise and conscientious individuals should strive to shape the best outcomes in particular issues that come within their jurisdiction In the constrained vision the inherent limitations of individuals mean that each individuals best contribution to society is to adhere to the special duties of his institutional role and let systemic processes determine outcomes By contrast the unconstrained vision was exemplified in Chief Justice Earl Warrens interruption of lawyers unfolding complex legal principles to ask But is it right Is it good In the constrained vision that was neither his business nor within his competence for the specialists superiority exists only within a narrow range of skillsin this instance determining how the written law applied to the case at hand Burke said I revere men in the functions which belong to them78but not beyond    Just as the unconstrained vision urges judicial activism on judges it urges social responsibility upon businessmenthat they should hire invest donate and otherwise conduct their businesses with an eye to producing specific benefits to society at large The socially responsible businessman should for example hire the disadvantaged invest in things that seem most needed by society rather than those most profitable to his firm and turn part of the proceeds over to charitable and cultural activities rather than pay all the proceeds out to the stockholders or plow them back into the business    The constrained vision sees such things as outside the competence of businessmen given the wider ramifications of such decisions in a complex systemic process According to the constrained vision of human knowledge what is within the businessmans competence is the running of his particular firm so as to promote its prosperity within the law It is the systemic effect of competition rather than the individual intentions of businessmen which this vision relies on to produce social benefit According to Adam Smith it is when the businessman intends only his own gain that he contributes via the process of competitionto promote the social good more effectually than when he really intends to promote it Smith added I have    never known much good done by those who affected to trade for the public good79    The writings of those with the constrained vision abound with examples of counterproductive consequences of wellintentioned policies But to those with the unconstrained vision this is simply seizing upon isolated mistakes that are correctable in order to resist tendencies that are socially beneficial on the whole However to those with the constrained vision these mistakes are not happenstances but symptoms of what to expect when the inherent limitations of individuals are ignored and systemic processes for coping with these limitations are deranged by specific tinkering      Sincerity Versus Fidelity     Because of conflicting visions of how much knowledge a given individual can have and how effective that knowledge can be in deciding complex social issues the two visions attach widely differing importance to sincerity and fidelity Where the wise and conscientious individual is conceived to be competent to shape socially beneficial outcomes directly then his sincerity and dedication to the common good are crucial Godwins whole purpose was to strengthen the individuals sincerity fortitude and justice80 The importance of general sincerity81 was a recurring theme in Godwin and has remained so over the centuries among others with the unconstrained vision Sincerity tends to liberate82 according to Godwin and to bring every other virtue in its train83 While conceding that everyone is insincere at some time or other84 Godwin nevertheless urged a general and unalterable sincerity85 as a powerful ideal capable of producing profound social benefits    Sincerity holds no such place of honor in the constrained vision Those with this vision often readily concede sincerity to their adversaries treating it as an individual virtue of minor social benefitand sometimes as a major aggravating factor when people persist in socially counterproductive ideals What is morally central to the constrained vision is fidelity to duty in ones role in life There within the sphere of his competence the individual can make the greatest contribution to the social good by serving the great systemic process which decides the actual outcomes This is an entirely different conception of duty from that of the unconstrained vision where ones duty is direct beneficence to mankind86 But in the constrained vision the individual wielding social decisionmaking power lacks the competence to continually make ad hoc determinations of what specifically is good for mankind however sincere he may be       In the constrained vision the businessmans moral duty is fidelity to the stockholders who have entrusted their savings to him not sincere pursuit of the public good through charitable donations or investment or hiring decisions which compromise that trust Similarly the judges moral duty is to faithfully carry out the law he was sworn to uphold not sincerely change that law to produce better results as he sees them Within this vision a scholars moral duty is to faithfully promote the intellectual process among his students and readers not lead them to specific conclusions he sincerely believes to be best for society For similar reasons advocacy journalism or liberation theology are also anathema to those with the constrained vision since both are seen as misuses of entrusted roles    Sincerity is so central to the unconstrained vision that it is not readily conceded to adversaries who are often depicted as apologists if not venal It is not uncommon in this tradition to find references to their adversaries real reasons which must be unmasked Even where sincerity is conceded to adversaries it is often accompanied by references to those adversaries blindness prejudice or narrow inability to transcend the status quo Within the unconstrained vision sincerity is a great concession to make while those with the constrained vision can more readily make that concession since it means so much less to them Nor need adversaries be depicted as stupid by those with the constrained vision for they conceive of the social process as so complex that it is easy even for wise and moral individuals to be mistakenand dangerously so They may do the worst of things without being the worst of men according to Burke87    Related to the question of sincerity versus fidelity is the issue of roles or structured relationships Fidelity to roles is central to the constrained vision for in carrying out defined roles the individual is relying on the experiential capital of nations and of ages in Burkes terms Among contemporaries he is leaving specific results to be determined by the values knowledge and capabilities of others fulfilling his own role only to serve faithfully the processes which make this possible But in the unconstrained vision where the individuals own reason and sincerity are paramount roles are seen as    needlessly constricting Those with the unconstrained vision tend to deplore role stereotypes to seek less structured situations to democratize parentchild or studentteacher relationships to deemphasize titles and formalities    All these patterns are consistent with their underlying vision of human capabilities in ad hoc decisionmaking It is equally consistent for those with a more constrained vision of those individual capabilities to enlist roles and rules which tap the results of unarticulated historical experience thereby restraining existing incumbents in these roles Roles which involve enormous trustparentchild or doctorpatient roles for exampleare also roles that preclude sex for example and those with the constrained vision are especially outraged if this taboo is broken Others often are as well but such opposition is not logically compelled by the unconstrained vision    Both sincerity and fidelity can be seen as aspects of honestybut as very different aspects weighed differently in the opposing visions The constrained vision in particular distinguishes sincerity from fidelity to truth The first thing a man will do for his ideals is lie according to J A Schumpeter88 It is one reason why sincerity is given such light weight in the constrained vision A modern defense of judicial activism by Alexander Bickel clearly put more weight on sincerity than on fidelity when he urged that dissimulation was unavoidable89 and referred to statesmanlike deviousness in the public interest90 When Bickel later turned against judicial activism he also shifted moral grounds now emphasizing fidelity over sincerity It was now a moral duty of judges to obey the manifest constitution with improvements being left to the amending process91 In both positions Bickels conclusions were consistent with his respective visions    The rationale for fidelity to the truth is very similar to the rationale for fidelity to roles In both cases one subordinates ones own ad hoc conception of what would be best for society in the particular case to adherence to a broader systemic processaccepted canons of morality in    this instancein which one has greater confidence as to its longrun benefits to society    Here again it is necessary to note that none of the great historic visions has been either 100 percent unconstrained or 100 percent constrained Differences of degree among unconstrained visions are often crucial as regards the significance of truthand of force In a very pure unconstrained vision such as that of Godwin reason is so powerfulomnipotent was his characterization92that neither deception nor force was justified in pursuing the public good93 Thus even though the wisest and most beneficent might be on a far higher plane than most people as of a given time their ultimate ability to gain public assent was virtually inevitable But where the unconstrained vision of human potential postulates more resistant frictions en route to realizing the goal falsehood and force become not merely rights but duties for the enormous benefits of an irreversible breakthrough go on for centuries over which time the initial costs are to be amortized    If one believes like Lenin that the level of popular consciousness spontaneously achievable is inherently insufficient to the task94 then more farseeing elites have an enormous historic role to play95 and must employ whatever means are necessary Although both Godwin and Lenin rejected the naturally evolved systemic processes which are central to the constrained vision the differences in degree in their assumptions about human knowledge and reason produce profound differences in kind as to the role of truth and force Relations between believers in Lenins version of Marxism and believers in democratic socialism have historically been very bitter A small shift of assumptions can have profound effects on the vision and on the action that follows from it      Youth and Age     With experience and articulated rationality having such vastly differing weights in the two visions it is virtually inevitable that the young and the old should be seen in correspondingly different terms In the constrained vision which depends upon the least fallible guide of human experience96 the young cannot be compared to the old in wisdom Adam Smith considered it unbecoming for the young to have the same confidence as the old97 The wisest and most experienced are generally the least credulous he said and this depended crucially on time It is acquired wisdom and experience only that teach incredulity and they very seldom teach it enough98    By contrast when knowledge and reason are conceived as articulated rationality as in the unconstrained vision the young have considerable advantages Condorcet wrote in the eighteenth century A young man now leaving school possesses more real knowledge than the greatest geniuses not of antiquity but even of the seventeenth centurycould have acquired after long study99 In an unconstrained vision where much of the malaise of the world is due to existing institutions and existing beliefs those least habituated to those institutions and beliefs are readily seen as especially valuable for making needed social changes According to Godwin  The next generation will not have so many prejudices to subdue Suppose a despotic nation by some revolution in its affairs possessed of freedom The children of the present race will be bred in more firm and independent habits of thinking the suppleness the timidity and the vicious dexterity of their fathers will give place to an erect mien and a clear and decisive judgment100            Children are a sort of raw material put into our hands according to Godwin101 Their minds are like a sheet of white paper102 The young were viewed by Godwin as a downtrodden group103 but from among them may be found one of the longlookedfor saviors of the human race104 However the constrained view which seeks prudent tradeoffs rather than dramatic solutions cannot seek prudence in youth for prudence was regarded as the fruit of experience105 Nor was moral fervor a substitute It is no excuse for presumptuous ignorance that it is directed by insolent passion according to Burke106 Burkes American disciple John Randolph said I am not speaking to the groundlings to the tyros and junior apprentices but to the greyheaded men of this nation    107 But to those with the unconstrained vision old age merited no such special consideration According to Condorcet prejudice and avarice were characteristics common to old age108      SUMMARY AND IMPLICATIONS     The distribution of knowledge in society varies greatly according to the definition of knowledge Where knowledge is defined in the constrained vision to include vast amounts of unarticulated but vitally important information and conclusions summarized in habits aversions and attractions as well as in words and numbers then it is far more broadly spread through a society than when its definition as in the unconstrained vision is restricted to the more sophisticatedly articulated facts and relationships The constrained vision which sees severe limits on mans conscious rationality relies heavily on evolved systemic processes to convey and coordinate the broad array of knowledge necessary for human survival and progress The unconstrained vision which sees greater prospects for human mastery of knowledge sees in those with special intellectual skills both the proof of its assumption and the vehicles of knowledge and reason for promoting social improvement    Articulation plays an important role in the dissemination of knowledge as knowledge is conceived in the unconstrained vision Discussion is the path that leads to discovery and demonstration according to Godwin109 who as noted earlier also considered accuracy of language to be the indispensable prerequisite of sound knowledge110 But articulation plays no such crucial role in the constrained vision It has been the misfortune not as these gentlemen think it the glory of this age that everything is to be discussed Burke declared111 He had no use for pert loquacity112 and argued that even reason by frequent repetition loses its force113 Hamilton was suspicious of skilled articulation which could be mere painting and exaggeration114 or artificial reasoning to vary the nature and obvious sense of words115 and noted that it is extremely easy on either    side to say a great number of plausible things116 Hobbes declared that words are wise mens counters but they are the mony of fooles117 Unarticulated social experience has remained a more effective guide to behavior than articulated rationality in the tradition of the constrained vision According to Hayek it is enough that people know how to act in accordance with the rules without knowing that the rules are such and such in articulated terms118    Articulate youth idealistic and trained in the latest and most advanced forms of knowledge as knowledge is conceived in the unconstrained vision are a great hope for the future to those with that vision So are intellectuals Neither is viewed in this way in the constrained vision Where knowledge is more expansively defined and consequently more widely distributed as in the constrained vision intellectuals have no commanding advantage over the common man According to Hayek  Compared with the totality of knowledge which is continually utilized in the evolution of a dynamic civilization the difference between the knowledge that the wisest and that which the most ignorant individual can deliberately employ is comparatively insignificant119          When Hayek referred to that little extra knowledge which intellectuals possessed120 he echoed a skepticism about intellectuals that goes back for centuries among those with the constrained vision Hobbes like Smith found little natural difference among men121 and such social differences as he found were by no means always favorable to intellectuals The common man according to Hobbes seldom engaged in meaningless words which he saw as the hallmark of intellectuals122 Moreover the real differences among the quality of peoples decisions were due more to systemic incentives than to their individual knowledge or sophistication A plain husbandman is more Prudent in the affaires of his own house than a Privy Counselor in the affaires of other men123 In this view the incentives facing intellectuals were to demonstrate their cleverness rather than to be    correct in terms of results affecting other people According to Hobbes intellectuals study more the reputation of their own wit than the successe of another s business124    The arrogance and exhibitionism of intellectuals were likewise recurring themes in Burke125along with the dangers that such intellectuals posed to society He spoke of their grand theories to which they would have heaven and earth to bend126 Hobbes also saw those who thinke themselves wiser and abler to govern as sources of distraction and civil war127 Hamilton likewise saw intellectuals as dangerous because of their tendency to follow the treacherous phantoms of an ever craving and never to be satisfied spirit of innovation128 Even where intellectuals were not conceived of as positively dangerous to the social order their role as policy makers was seen in the constrained vision as often inferior to that of ordinary people John Randolph said that he knew men who could not write a book or even spell this famous word Congress who nevertheless had more practical sense than any intellectual 129    But to believers in the unconstrained vision intellectuals are precursors to their fellows in the discovery of truth130 in Godwins words Likewise according to Condorcet the discovery of speculative truths is the sole means of advancing the human race131 However those with a radically different conception of man knowledge and rationality see intellectuals as a dangernot simply to a particular society but to any society      Chapter 4    Visions of Social Processes    Differences in the vision of human nature are reflected in differences in the vision of social processes It is not merely that social processes are seen as mitigating the shortcomings of human nature in one vision and as aggravating them in the other The very ways that social processes function and malfunction are seen differently in the two visions which differ not only in their view of morality but also in their view of causation    Social processes cover an enormous range from language to warfare from love to economic systems Each of these in turn comes in a great variety of forms But there are also some things in common among social processes in general Whether viewed within the framework of a constrained or an unconstrained vision social processes have certain characteristicsan order whether or not intentionally designed Social processes also take time and have costs Each of theseand otheraspects of social processes is seen differently in the constrained and the unconstrained visions      ORDER AND DESIGN     A pattern of regularities may reflect either an intentional design or the evolution of circumstances not planned by any of the agents or forces involved in its emergence Trees or vegetation of different kinds may grow wild at different heights on a mountainside or a garden may be laid out with great care and forethought by a gardener Both visions acknowledge the existence of both kinds of social processes but they differ on the extent efficiency and desirability of evolved orders and planned designs      The Constrained Vision     The contrained vision puts little faith in deliberately designed social processes since it has little faith that any manageable set of decision makers could effectively cope with the enormous complexities of designing a whole blueprint for an economic system a legal system or a system of morality or politics The constrained vision relies instead on historically evolved social processes and evaluates them in terms of their systemic characteristicstheir incentives and modes of interactionrather than their goals or intentions    Language is perhaps the purest example of an evolved social processa systemic order without a deliberate overall design Rules of language are indeed written down but after the fact codifying existing practices and most people have begun obeying these rules in early childhood before being explicitly taught them Yet languages are extremely complex and subtle and of course vital to the functioning of a society Even for small children language is not so much a matter of parroting what has been explicitly articulated but rather of inferring complex rules never fully explained1    Language is thus the epitome of an evolved complex order with its own systemic characteristics inner logic and external social consequencesbut without having been deliberately designed by any individual or council Its rationality is systemic not individualan evolved pattern rather than an excogitated blueprint    Language is in effect a model for social processes in legal economic political and other systems as viewed within the constrained vision2 It is    not that languages cannot be createdEsperanto clearly wasbut that they are more effective when evolved because natural languages draw upon a more vast wealth of experiences over the centuries than will be at the command of any individual or council designing a language Evolved language also serves a greater multiplicity of purposes than any given individual or council may be able to enumerate much less weigh    In much the same way the complex characteristics of an economic system may be analyzed in skeletal outline after the fact but the fleshand blood reality has often evolved on its ownand it is considered more efficient when markets have evolved than when planned by central authorities Deliberate action or planning at the individual level is by no means precluded by the constrained vision just as individuals choose their own words and writing style within the scope and rules of language What is rejected in both cases by the constrained vision is individual or intentional planning of the whole system Man as conceived in the constrained vision simply is not capable of such a feat though he is capable of the hubris of attempting it Systemic rationality is considered superior to individual or intentional rationality    The constrained vision is not a static vision of the social process nor a view that the status quo should not be altered On the contrary its central principle is evolution Language does not remain unchanged but neither is it replaced according to a new master plan A given language may evolve over the centuries to something almost wholly different but as a result of incremental changes successively validated by the usage of the many rather than the planning of the few In politics as well evolution is the keynote of the constrained vision Burke declared A state without the means of some change is without the means of its conservation3 Yet he would not subject whole political systems to the mercy of untried speculations4 Individual brilliance was no substitute for pragmatic adjustments even by people of less brilliance  I have never yet seen any plan which has not been mended by the observations of those who were much inferior in understanding to the person who took the lead in the business By a slow but wellsustained    progress the effect of each step is watched the good or ill success of the first gives light to us in the second and so from light to light we are conducted safely through the whole series5          The same basic view has been expressed in the twentieth century by F A Hayek  Tradition is not something constant but the product of a process of selection guided not by reason but by success6          The Hayekian view is even further removed from deliberate design than that of Burke since Hayek incorporates a survival of the fittest culture selection process which depends upon survival in competition with other social systems rather than simply on the basis of pragmatic individual judgments of success7 The intervening influence of Darwin between these two exponents of the constrained vision is apparent It is not however a theory of the survival of the fittest individuals but of the fittest social processes      The Unconstrained Vision     Without the underlying assumption that mans deliberate reason is too limited to undertake comprehensive social planning an entirely different set of conclusions emerges in field after field If for example effective rational planning and direct control of an entire economic system is possible then it is clearly more efficient to reach desired results directly in this way rather than as the end result of circuitous and uncontrolled processes Where desirability can be specified by a small group of social decisionmakers rather than depending upon a multitude of mutually conflicting values among the populace at large then social issues become very much analogous to engineering problemsan analogy often occurring among those with this approach and equally often denounced from the opposing perspective of the constrained vision8    One of the most striking visions which conceived of social issues as essentially engineering problems was that of Thorstein Veblen This view expressed in a number of Veblens writings was crystallized and elaborated in his The Engineers and the Price System Here he explicitly rejected the systemic processes of the marketplacethe price systemin favor of direct control by the relevant experts the engineers Few others have carried this mode of thought to such a logical extreme but elements of it appear in a number of later writers John Kenneth Galbraith for example like Veblen conceived of the pricing mechanism as inadequate and manipulated by powerful interests if not wholly fraudulent9 Others with varying degrees of skepticism about economic and other systemic processes have likewise tended to seek more direct control by those with the requisite expertise and commitment to the public interest Advocates of industrial policy are one of the latest in this tradition Not all seek a special role for engineers as    such but rely on an analogy between engineering problems and social issues    In the engineering analogy growing out of the unconstrained vision one can begin with societys needs because it is possible to have an objective analysis of what is really desirable10 The public interest can be specified and therefore pursued rationally It is then a question of assembling the relevant facts and articulating thema full presentation of the items we can choose amongto determine how to achieve the resulting goals Social issues thus reduce to a matter of technical coordination by experts11 Unlike the systemic vision in which there are inherently conflicting uses because of multiplicities of conflicting values in the populace at large in this rationalistic vision select third parties can agree on what constitutes needs waste or the spoiling of the natural or manmade environment    In this perspective there are not only social solutions but often obvious solutionsthough not necessarily easy solutions given the opposition of those with a vested interest in the status quo Truth and above all political truth is not hard of acquisition according to Godwin What is required is independent and impartial discussion by unambitious and candid people12 The nature of good and evil was in Godwins view one of the plainest subjects to understand13 What is needed is for good sense and clear and correct perceptions to gain ascendancy in the world14    Very similar assessments are to be found in later writers with the unconstrained vision Evil in the existing society is neither incurable nor even very hard to cure when you have diagnosed it scientifically according to George Bernard Shaw15 International conflicts are likewise neither inevitable nor inherently difficult to settle The issues in military conflicts are usually things which warring nations could have settled with the greatest ease without the shedding of one drop of blood if they had been on decent human terms with one another instead of on competitive capitalistic terms16 Existing society is only an artificial system    susceptible of almost infinite modification and readjustmentnay of practical demolition and substitution at the will of Man according to Shaw17 Every successful private business was an example of the ease with which public ones could be performed as soon as there was the effective will to find out the way18    In short the intrinsic difficulties which dominate the constrained vision are not the real obstacle in the unconstrained vision in which deliberate obstruction and obfuscation account for many evils and in which what is crucially needed on the part of the publicspirited reformers is commitment    In Edward Bellamys famous social novel Looking Backward a citizen of an advanced future society remarks to a man from the past on the singular blindness of the old society in which social troubles and dissatisfactions necessarily portended changes19 that things had to be done in the common interest20 To take control of the economy was not difficult for the larger the business the simpler the principles that can be applied to it   21 Purely clerical devices provide all the information we can possibly need22 A simple system of book accounts is all that is required23 Competition for resources was not intrinsic but due to a system which made the interests of every individual antagonistic to those of every other   24 Concepts of waste25 blindness26 and the public interest27 abound along with repeated assertions of the intrinsic simplicity of rationally managing a society28    More sophisticated modern versions of the unconstrained or rationalistic vision are variations on the same themes Even where societies are conceived to be more complex modern expertise is able to master the complexities making its central management still quite feasible Thus in more sophisticated versions of the unconstrained vision whole societies remain readily manageable though by experts rather than by the mass of ordinary people Thirdparty decisionmaking plays a key role Delegation to experts has become an indispensable aid to rational calculation in modern life29 What is desirable or undesirable preferred satisfactory or    unsatisfactory are referred to in passing without explanation as apparently things too obvious to require explanation30 Needs are also treated in the same way31 There are analogies given to engineering or scientific social decisionmaking by third parties  Bureaucracy itself is a method for bringing scientific judgments to bear on policy decisions the growth of bureaucracy in modern government is itself partly an index of the increased capacity of government to make use of expert knowledge32          This modern promotion of the use of experts echoes a tradition which goes back at least as far as the eighteenth century when Condorcet saw the physical sciences as providing a model which the social sciences should follow33 Indeed he used the term social science34 and urged that quantification and theories of probability be used in formulating social policies35    Another recurring theme in the unconstrained vision is how profoundly different current issues are from those of the past so that the historically evolved beliefsthe conventional wisdom in Galbraiths phrase36can no longer apply Nor is this a new and recent conclusion In the eighteenth century Godwin declared that we cannot make todays decisions on the basis of a timid reverence for the decisions of our ancestors37 Such terms as outmoded and irrelevant are common in dismissals of what in the opposing vision is called the wisdom of the ages    The issue is not as to whether changes have occurred in human history but whether these are in effect changes of costumes and scenery or changes of the play itself In the constrained vision it is mostly the costumes and scenery that have changed in the unconstrained vision the play itself has changed the characters are fundamentally different and equally sweeping changes are both likely and necessary in the future      PROCESS COSTS     All social processeswhether economic religious political or other involve costs These costs are seen very differently by those with the constrained and the unconstrained visions just as they see differently the kinds of attitudes needed in these processessincerity versus fidelity for example These costs may be due to time or to violence among other sources their corresponding benefits may be apportioned justly or unjustly and their recipients may be free or unfree All these aspects are assessed differently in the constrained and the unconstrained visions      Time     The passage of time and its irreversibility create special decisionmaking difficulties social processes and moral principlesall of which are seen quite differently by those with the constrained and the unconstrained visions Both recognize that decisions made at one point in time have consequences at other points in time But the ways of coping with this fact depend upon the capabilities of human beings and especially of human knowledge and foresight    Accretions of knowledge over time mean that individual and social decisions made under conditions of lesser knowledge have consequences under conditions of greater knowledge To those with the unconstrained vision this means that being bound by past decisions represents a loss of benefits made possible by later knowledge Being bound by past decisions whether in constitutional law cases or in marriage for life is seen as costly and irrational The unconstrained vision therefore tends toward seeking the greatest flexibility for changing decisions in the light of later information In arguing against Lockes concept of a social contract William Godwin took a position that was applicable to intertemporal commitments in general  Am I precluded from better information for the whole course of my life And if not for the whole life why for a year a week or even an hour38          To Godwin One of the principal means of information is time Therefore we needlessly restrict the effect of knowledge on our actions if    we bind ourselves today to the conduct we will observe two months hence39 Future commitments require a man to shut up his mind against further information as to what his conduct in that future ought to be40 To live by anticipating future knowledge was to Godwin as improvident as living by anticipating future income41    In the unconstrained vision there are moral as well as practical consequences to intertemporal commitments Gratitude as well as loyalty and patriotism for example are all essentially commitments to behave differently in the future toward individuals or societies than one would behave on an impartial assessment of circumstances as they might exist at some future time if those individuals and societies were encountered for the first time Where two lives are jeopardized and only one can be saved to save the one who is your father may be an act of loyalty but not an act of justice42 Thus in behavioral terms gratitude and loyalty are intertemporal commitments not to be impartialnot to use future knowledge and future moral assessments to produce that result which you would otherwise consider best if confronting the same individuals and situations for the first time From this perspective loyalty promises patriotism gratitude precedents oaths of fidelity constitutions marriage social traditions and international treaties are all constrictions imposed earlier when knowledge is less on options to be exercised later when knowledge will be greater They were all condemned by Godwin43 All were prior constraints on that uncontroled exercise of private judgment44 which Godwin espoused    The binding of judicial decisions by constitutions and legal precedents was seen by Godwin as another example of intertemporal commitments based on lesser knowledge impeding better decisions based on greater knowledge that emerges later According to Godwins principles  An enlightened and reasonable judicature would have recourse in order to decide the cause before them to no code but the code of reason They would feel the absurdity of other mens teaching them what they should think and pretending to understand the case before    them before it happened better than they who had all the circumstances under their inspection45          All those things condemned by Godwinloyalty constitutions marriage etchave been lauded and revered by those with a constrained vision The process costs entailed by intertemporal commitments depend on 1 how much more knowledge rationality and impartiality human beings are capable of bringing to bear as a result of the passage of time and 2 on the cost of accepting the disadvantages of momenttomoment decision making Where the capability of greater knowledge and understanding is considered to be largeas in the unconstrained visionthe case for avoiding commitment is strongest Where this capability is considered to be inherently very limitedas in the constrained visionthe benefits are correspondingly smaller and more readily overbalanced by other considerations    In social principles especially Burke saw no fundamental advance to be expected from the passage of time  We know that we have made no discoveries and we think that no discoveries are to be made in morality nor many in the great principles of government nor in the ideas of liberty   46          More generally the very concept of social science which largely originated among those with the unconstrained vision beginning with Condorcet in the eighteenth century is often viewed skeptically by those with the constrained vision if not rejected outright as a pretentious delusion of being scientific where the prerequisites of science do not exist47 Changing historically evolved principles on the basis of social science theories or studies has become the hallmark of modern social thinkers with the unconstrained visionand the bte noir of those with the constrained    vision Government according to Burke requires more experience than any person can gain in his whole life48 Given this premise the incremental gain in individual knowledge by avoiding commitments is trivial compared to the gain to be made by fidelity to the accumulated experience of the society    In a world where the individual is to be guided by the collective wisdom of his culture in accordance with the constrained vision culture must itself have some stability in order to serve as a guide Without this stability no man could know what would be the test of honour in a nation continually varying the standard of its coin according to Burke49 The judicial situation posed by Godwin may well lead to poorer decisions than if judges were completely free to decide each case ad hoc but the constrained vision offsets such losses against the prospective guidance provided by known rules leading to fewer criminal law violations or needs for civil litigation To Burke the evils of inconstancy were ten thousand times worse than those of obstinacy and the blindest prejudice50 In short process costs arising from unreliable social expectations outweighed the value of incremental individual knowledge or its more finely tuned application    Given the perspective of the constrained vision a judge should not even attempt to reach the socially best decision in the case before him According to Hayek The only public good with which he can be concerned is the observance of those rules that the individual could reasonably count on The judge should apply the rules even if in the particular instance the known consequences will appear to him wholly undesirable51 The cost is justified only because other and larger costs are entailed by alternative social processes according to the constrained vision of human capabilities Such a conclusion is however anathema to believers in the unconstrained vision The courts will never permit themselves to be used as instruments of inequity and injustice according to a landmark court case52 To knowingly accept injustice is unconscionable in the unconstrained vision But in the constrained vision injustices are inevitable with the only real question being whether there will be more with one process than another      To Adam Smith as well general stability was more important than particular benefits The peace and order of society is of more importance than even the relief of the miserable Therefore even though he believed that the rich and the great are too often preferred to the wise and the virtuous he noted that determining the former involved lower process costs so that the peace and order of society would rest more securely upon the plain and palpable difference of birth and fortune than upon the invisible and often uncertain difference of wisdom and virtue53    Once again where those with an unconstrained vision see a solution those with a constrained vision see a tradeoff The unconstrained vision seeks the best individual decisions arrived at seriatim and in ad hoc fashion By contrast the constrained vision trades off the benefits of both wisdom and virtue against the benefits of stability of expectations and standards It may concede that one process offers abstractly better individual decisions but deducts the process costs of those decisions to arrive at a net balance which may turn out to favor the less prepossessing alternativepalpable distinctions of rank versus less perceptible differences of wisdom and virtue for example    This calculation need not always come down on the side of the status quo many of the leading exemplars of the constrained vision were advocates of unpopular and sometimes drastic changes as noted in Chapter 3 But the fact that better decisions in themselves were not sufficient to justify change because of process costs provided a basis for those with the constrained vision to reject many proposed changes that would otherwise be compelling on the basis of the unconstrained vision In short human beings as conceived in the unconstrained vision should logically follow very different policies from those to be followed by human beings as conceived in the constrained vision    Social rules are as central to the constrained vision as unfettered individual judgment and individual conscience are at the heart of the unconstrained vision As F A Hayek has put it    We live in a society in which we can successfully orientate ourselves and in which our actions have a good chance of achieving their aims not only because our fellows are governed by known aims or known connections between means and ends but because they are also confined by rules whose purpose or origin we often do not know and of whose very existence we are often unaware54          Commonly shared implicit rules thus reduce process costs But process costs are less and less of a consideration the greater is the individuals capacity to decide each issue on its merits as it arises Rules thus range from a nuisance to an intolerable burden in the unconstrained vision The difference between the two visions is therefore especially sharp as regards rules and practices relating to intertemporal commitmentsloyalty constitutions and marriage for example    At the extremes the constrained vision says My country right or wrong while the unconstrained vision casts its exponent in the role of a citizen of the world ready to oppose his own country in words or actions whenever he sees fit Patriotism and treason thus become a meaningless distinction at the extremes of the unconstrained vision while this distinction is one of the most central and most powerful distinctions in the constrained vision    The constrained vision is premised on necessary and irremediable ignorance on everyones part in the words of Hayek55 who also sees that individual rationalistic decisionmaking of the unconstrained vision demands complete knowledge of all the relevant facts To Hayek the latter is utterly impossible for the functioning of society depends upon social coordination of millions of facts which in their entirety are not known to anybody56 To Hayek it is a delusion that all the relevant facts are known to some one mind57 making a decision and considering its wider ramifications In the constrained vision the benefits of an advanced civilization derive from the better social coordination of widely dispersed    fragments of knowledgenot from greater knowledge in the individual According to Hayek  In civilized society it is indeed not so much the greater knowledge that the individual can acquire as the greater benefit he receives from the knowledge possessed by others which is the cause of his ability to pursue an infinitely wider range of ends than merely the satisfaction of his most pressing physical needs Indeed a civilized individual may be very ignorant more ignorant than many a savage and yet greatly benefit from the civilization in which he lives58          In this vision it is especially unwarranted for the individual to place himself outside or above the society which makes his life and his understanding possible Even great achievements by an individual are deemed to be necessarily confined to a narrow slice of the sweeping spectrum of concerns which a society coordinates and therefore provide no basis for him to imagine that he can disassemble and reassemble in a better way the complex society around him Their very excellence in their peculiar functions may leave such outstanding individuals less than qualified in others according to Burke59 In a similar vein Hamilton argued that even the greatest genius would overlook decisive considerations which an ordinary man might see60    While the comparison between the intellectually or morally superior individual and average people is the relevant one from the standpoint of the unconstrained vision to those with the constrained vision even the most outstanding individualsintellectually or morallyare inherently very limited in their grasp of the knowledge and of the innumerable interrelationships which make a society viable Therefore in the constrained vision the historic and systemic wisdom expressed inarticulately in the culture of the many is more likely to be correct than the special insights of the few Both processes mobilize human experience and understanding but in very different ways The very concept of reason is different in the two visions In Hayeks words    Reason which has included the capacity of the mind to distinguish between good and evil that is between what was and was not in accordance with established rules came to mean a capacity to construct such rules by deduction from explicit premises61          In the constrained vision society is often analogized to a living organism which cannot be comprehensively disassembled and reconstructed in a different way without fatal results Burke for example wrote of hacking a body into pieces and then throwing the pieces into the kettle of magicians in hopes of regeneration62 In the constrained vision the concept of nationbuilding is a fundamental misconception63 Nations may grow and evolve but cannot be built    The intertemporal commitment of loyalty seen as an abandonment of impartiality in future behavior by those with the unconstrained vision was viewed very differently by those with the constrained vision If ones view of human nature is very constrained then the alternative to loyalty is not impartiality but pure selfishness The kinds of emotional attachments which lead to loyalty are thus seen as beneficial social ties essential to the functioning of the whole society According to Burke  To be attached to the subdivision to love the little platoon we belong to in society is the first principle the germ as it were of public affections It is the first link in the series by which we proceed towards a love of our country and to mankind64          In a similar vein Hamilton said  We love our families more than our neighbors We love our neighbors more than our countrymen in general65            By contrast Godwin put his faith in the spread of reason rather than a brute and unintelligent sympathy66 He distinguished undisciplined feelings from feelings that have ripened into virtuethe latter embracing the whole human race in their concern From Godwins perspective the love of our country is a deceitful principle which would establish a preference built upon accidental relations and not upon reason67    Neither vision regards the smaller units as intrinsically more important than the larger units The unconstrained vision simply regards man as ultimately capable of understanding that principle and acting upon it The constrained vision sees that as beyond human nature in practice even if agreed to in theory and that strong naturally arising emotional attachments must therefore be socially utilized as a counterweight to personal selfishness Adam Smith for example rejected the rationalistic view which would attempt to establish directly the primacy of the species over the nation  We do not love our country merely as part of the great society of mankindwe love it for its own sake and independently of any such consideration That wisdom which contrived the system of human affections as well as that of every other part of nature seems to have judged that the interest of the great society of mankind would be best promoted by directing the principal attention of each individual to that particular portion of it which was most within the sphere both of his abilities and his understanding68          As in his economic theories so in his moral theories Smith focused on individual behavior precisely as it conduces indirectly to social benefits not simply because it benefits the individual This indirection in both cases was due to Smiths conception of man as lacking either the knowledge or sufficient will to produce consistent social benefits directly Hamilton    likewise considered selfishness as an unchangeable part of human nature so that wise social policy could at best gently divert the channel and direct it if possible to the public good69    Those without this constrained vision of human nature equally logically proceed in the opposite way by demanding an end of nationalism and an assumption of social responsibility by both individuals and institutions toward ones fellow human beings whether at home or overseas The greater the capabilities of man the smaller the process costs and the more directly the social good can be pursued      Freedom and Justice     The two visions judge social processes by fundamentally different criteria In the unconstrained vision where individual intentions and individual justice are central it is enormously important whether individual rewards are merited or merely reflect privilege and luck Both individual leaders and social policies ought to be chosen with a view to their dedication to the goal of ending privilege and promoting either equality or merit But in the constrained vision social processes are to be judged by their ability to extract the most social benefit from mans limited potentialities at the lowest cost This means rewarding scarce and valuable abilities which include abilities which may be mere windfall gains to the individuals possessing them being in many cases either natural endowments or skills cultivated at prosperous parents expense but too costly for most peoples means Sometimes the scarce and valuable traits to be rewarded may include skills and orientations picked up almost by osmosis from being raised in families where they exist    In the unconstrained vision the social benefits of individual skills can be elicited without individually unmerited rewardsif not immediately then in some better society to develop over time From this perspective continuing to pay vastly different rewards retards the development of such a society But in the constrained vision of human nature no such development is likely to become general so that the injustice of paying unmerited rewards to individuals must be traded off against the injustice of depriving society of available benefits by not paying enough to provide incentives to their production and full utilization    The two visions differ not merely in moral judgment but more fundamentally in their sense of social causation In the constrained vision    the crucial characteristic of any social system is the set of incentives confronting the individuals in it This includes not only the explicit rewards and penalties of the marketplace and the law for example but also the internal psychic rewards and punishments evolved by the culture and its values Given an underlying human nature that is not fundamentally changing these systemic characteristics largely determine individual endeavors    These endeavors are not however directly realized Systemic interactions are not simplyor even mainlythe fruition of individual plans Adam Smiths businessman is not alone in producing results which were no part of his intention While social incentives are more important than individual intentions in the constrained vision the specific characteristics of systemic interactionsthe elaborate principles and channels of causation in a competitive economy for exampleare also essential to actual outcomes    In short the constrained vision takes human nature as given and sees social outcomes as a function of 1 the incentives presented to individuals and 2 the conditions under which they interact in response to those incentives These interactionsboth conflicting and cooperativeare too complex to lead simply to an average of the intentions of agents The results may in fact reflect no ones intentions nor even an average of most peoples intentions even if it is the best result achievable with the disparate values and conflicting claims made on inherently insufficient resources More thriftiness can lead to lower savings for example as a result of the circuitous effects of that thriftiness on aggregate demand production employment investment and income70 Similarly in the legal system more rights for particular groups can make those groups worse off71    Such unexpected results are not failures of a given system in the constrained vision As limitations on man and nature are inherent so disappointments are inherent In this vision the question is not whether problems are solvedthey will not bebut whether the best tradeoffs available have been made       In the unconstrained vision human nature itself is a variable and in fact the central variable to be changed The fact that particular individuals or groups have already exceeded the mass in intellect morality or dedication to the social good demonstrates what is possible The great obstacles to its achievement are the opposition of those benefiting from the existing social order and the inertia and blindness of others If these obstacles to progress are to be overcome it must be by the commitment intelligence and imagination of those who have grasped the possibilities open to society    In contrast to the constrained vision which seeks to analyze prescribe or judge only processes the unconstrained vision seeks to analyze prescribe or judge resultsincome distribution social mobility and equal or unequal treatment by a variety of institutions for example Processes are often condemned because their actual results are deemed unsatisfactory whatever their abstract merits as processes For example the illusory nature of freedom or equality to the poor has been a recurrent theme of the unconstrained vision for centuries The classic expression of this view was that of Anatole France  The law in its majestic equality forbids the rich as well as the poor to sleep under bridges to beg in the streets and to steal bread72          Sometimes the inequality of results from apparently evenhanded processes is deemed to be deliberate hypocrisy at other times merely a wrong result from an inadequate process In a similar vein one is not really free in the unconstrained vision merely because the political process does not legally confine ones actions If the actual means of achieving ones goals are lacking then there is no freedom in result even if there is freedom in the process In short the very definition of freedom differs between the two visions Regardless of the absence of legal restraints one is not free by the definition of the unconstrained vision if one cannot achieve his goals   73 For example Choosers are not free in    the market if high costs prohibit a choice that could be made available to them by sharing the commodity through collective choice74 More generally  Ones freedom finally depends on attaining important prime goals such as dignity respect love affection solidarity friendship To the extent that individuals lack these they cannot be free75          This resultsdefinition of freedom in the unconstrained vision is anathema to those with the constrained vision in which freedom is defined in terms of process characteristics Given the constrained vision of mans wisdom and morality he cannot successfully prescribe results but can only initiate processes whose consequences are often the direct opposite of his intentions Moreover even where certain results may be causally attainable they are not morally or intellectually justified independently of the process which brought them about Equality of results for those who have contributed to production abstained from production and hampered production is offensive to an equality of process in the constrained vision Justice is likewise a process characteristic in the constrained vision If a foot race is conducted under fair conditions then the result is just whether that result is the same person winning again and again or a different winner each time Results do not define justice in the constrained vision    To those with the unconstrained vision the best results should be sought directly To those with the constrained vision the best processes should be used and protected because the attempt to produce the best results directly is beyond human capacity The two visions original differences in their assumptions about human nature dog their footsteps as they go from issue to issue      SUMMARY AND IMPLICATIONS     The two visions differ fundamentally as to the sources of human survival and progress According to the unconstrained vision the patterned behavior of society is successful just and progressive insofar as it reflects the articulated rationality of man in general and of the most intellectually and morally advanced people in particular Orderand especially a just and progressive orderis the result of design backed by the commitment of people dedicated to the general welfare In broad outline this is the vision of the age of reason which began in eighteenthcentury France and has spread throughout the Western world and beyond    In the constrained vision where manindividually and collectively lacks both the intellectual and moral prerequisites for such deliberate comprehensive planning order evolves historically without design and more effectively than when it is designed Language is one example of such order without design and its complexity subtlety and effectiveness exemplify the power of systemic processes which tap the experience of all instead of relying on the special wisdom or nobility of any individual or council A prominent element within this tradition has applied the constrained vision to economicsbeginning with the Physiocrats also in eighteenthcentury France whose battle crylaissezfaire was given its fullest expression by Adam Smith and is exemplified today in the writings of Milton Friedman and Friedrich Hayek    Social processes in general are judged quite differently by the two visions The unconstrained vision tends to judge processes by their results Is it right Is it good in the words of Chief Justice Earl Warren The constrained vision judges rightness and goodness as process characteristics    rather than as results A foot race is fair if it is run under the proper conditionsregardless of who wins or loses or how often the same person wins Justice in the constrained vision thus means adherence to agreed upon rules while in the unconstrained vision something is just or unjust according to what end results occur    According to Hobbes he that fulfilleth the Law is Just76 But to Godwin justice is a result flowing from the contemplation of each individual case77 Results define justice for Godwin because whatever is not attended with any beneficial purpose is not just78 Clearly social processes ultimately exist for or are justified by beneficial resultsin both visions The two visions differ in their respective estimates of mans ability to directly produce those benefits The following of rules insteadwhether laws contracts customs or constitutionsis an inferior substitute justifiable if at all only by the lower process costs involved Even if it can be demonstrated in a given case that the result achieved by direct ad hoc decisionmaking is more efficient moral or otherwise desirable those with the constrained vision will assess its process costs in terms of how this violation of rules deranges the expectations of many others and adversely changes their future conduct as they lose confidence in the general reliability of existing rules and agreements and future rules and agreements Whether the ad hoc benefits outweigh the systemic losses depends upon the capability of mannot only in law but in economics politics and other areas    Freedom as well as justice is defined differently by the two visions for this same reason In the constrained vision freedom is a process characteristicthe absence of externally imposed impediments Hobbes applied this concept of freedom both to man and to inanimate things A man was not free if chained or restricted by prison walls and water was not free if hemmed in by river banks or by the walls of a container But where the lack of movement was due to internal causesa man fastened to his bed by sicknesse or a stone that lyeth stillthat was not considered by Hobbes to be a lack of freedom79 The same concept of freedom continues to characterize the constrained vision today Freedom to Hayek means    freedom from coercion freedom from the arbitrary power of other men but not release from the restrictions or compulsions of circumstances80    In the unconstrained vision however freedom is defined to include both the absence of direct externally imposed impediments and of the circumstantial limitations which reduce the range of choice  Only when he can support himself and his family choose his job and make a living wage can an individual and his family exercise real freedom Otherwise he is a servant to survival without the means to do what he wants81          As already noted freedom may be so broadly defined in the unconstrained vision as to include not only economic prerequisites but also psychic benefits derivable only from emotional ties to others82 John Dewey perhaps best summarized this viewpoint when he defined liberty as the effective power to do specific things83 With this definition whether the limits on that effective power were internal or external deliberate or circumstantial did not matter    These radically different conceptions of freedom reflect radically different conceptions of human capability In the constrained vision where man can at best initiate processes the most that he can do for freedom through social processes is to establish widely known rules which limit how much power is granted to one individual over another and limit the specific conditions under which the powerholder is authorized to exercise it But in the unconstrained vision where man is capable of both shaping and judging end results there is a corresponding right and duty to ensure that those results maximize the scope of choice of individuals that they remove impediments whether deliberate or circumstantial This may in some cases mean providing compensatory advantages to those whose social backgrounds would handicap them in competition with others whether for deliberate or circumstantial reasons But to those with the constrained    vision this is not only beyond the competence of any individual or council but also an effort likely to derange the social processes to the general disadvantage and danger of society    The complexity of social processes is a recurrent theme in both visions but in very different senses To those with the constrained vision it is axiomatic that no individual or council can master this complexity so that systemic processesmarket economies social traditions constitutional law are relied on instead But to those with the unconstrained vision individuals and councils can and must wrestle with social complexity The summary descriptions of systemic processes by their adversaries are considered simplistic since they do not specify particulars though specifying particulars would be selfcontradictory under the assumption of the constrained vision which is precisely that no one is capable of specifying the particular    The preoccupation with process characteristics among those with the constrained vision extends to many specific kinds of social processes just as in all the same processes those with the unconstrained vision seek directly to create particular results Where there are for example people living below some economic level defined as poverty those with the unconstrained vision tend to wish to subsidize them in some way to produce directly a more desirable result in the form of a higher standard of living Those with the constrained vision focus on the process incentives created by such schemes and their consequences on future behavior not only among these particular beneficiaries but also on others who may become less assiduous in avoiding unemployment teenage pregnancy or other factors considered as contributing to the general incidence of poverty    Now that the analysis of visions has proceeded from the two fundamentally different assumptions about mans moral and intellectual potentialities to the concepts of knowledge and reason appropriate to each assumption and has now applied these concepts in social processes the basic foundation for the conflict of visions has been established What remains to be built on that foundation are 1 more awareness of the    diversity of visions and their dynamics and 2 special attention to visions of equality visions of power and visions of justice which are central to the ideological conflicts of the age These are the subjects of the chapters that follow      Chapter 5    Varieties and Dynamics of Visions    Thus far the discussion has centered on what might be called pure visions or consistent visions clearly either constrained or unconstrained But as noted at the outset these are by no means the only possible kinds of visions There are not only degrees in each vision but also inconsistent and hybrid visions Moreover beliefs in visions are not static Both individuals and whole societies can change their visions over time These changes may be sudden road to Damascus conversions where a particular event reorients ones whole thinking or the change may be more like water wearing away rock so that one vision imperceptibly disappears to be replaced by a changing set of implicit assumptions about man and the world This second kind of change may leave no clear record of when or how it happened nor perhaps even an awareness on the part of those concerned except for knowing that things are no longer seen the same way they once were    Some changes of visions tend to be associated with age The clich of radicals in their twenties becoming conservatives in their forties goes back many generations Karl Marx predicted that the Russian radicals he met in Paris in the 1840s would be staunch supporters of the czarist regime in another twenty yearsthough he clearly did not expect any such conversion in his own case    Although visions can and do change the persistence and vitality of both constrained and unconstrained visions over a period of centuries suggest that such changes are not easy The anguish of the apostate comes from within as well as from the condemnation of his former comrades Those who lose their faith but continue the outward observances or who quietly withdraw if they can are likewise testimony to the power of visions and the    pain of change The terms in which such changes of social vision are discussedconversion apostasy heresyare borrowed from religious history though they apply equally to secular creeds which evoke similar emotional commitments    No comprehensive survey of visions seems possible and none will be attempted here However it will be useful to consider a few kinds of visions and the dynamics of visions in general But before surveying a variety of visions it will be necessary to define more specifically constrained and unconstrained visions      OPERATIONAL DEFINITIONS     No theory is literally 100 percent constrained or 100 percent unconstrained To be totally unconstrained in the most literal sense would be to have omniscience and omnipotence Religious visions may ascribe omniscience and omnipotence to God but that in itself constrains man and so precludes a completely unconstrained social vision A 100 percent constrained vision would mean that mans every thought and action are predestined and would be equally incompatible with advocating a particular social vision to be followed    Although the classic social visions considered here do not go to such ultimate extremes there are still very real differences in kind between them as well as differences in degree within each kind Once it is acknowledged that the dichotomy between constrained and unconstrained visions is simply a convenient way to separate some portions of a philosophical spectrum from others the question becomes one of choosing operational criteria for placing a particular range of visions in one of these categories rather than the otherand of recognizing that still other ranges of visions cannot be fitted into either category since constrained and unconstrained visions do not jointly exhaust all philosophies of man and society    The simplest case is when someone such as William Godwin elaborates the scope of human reason and the individual and social decisions which fall within its domain When the vast bulk of these decisions are deemed to be amenable to deliberately articulated rationality then there is clearly an unconstrained visionnot in the sense that man is literally omniscient but rather that whatever limitations there are in human knowledge and reason do not affect the analysis sufficiently to become an integral part of the    theory But few writers in either vision have systematically spelled out their assumptions and the conclusions which follow from them as explicitly as Godwin    Adam Smith incorporated his vision of mans limitations into his social theory explicitly in The Theory of Moral Sentiments and largely implicitly in The Wealth of Nations Others vary greatly in the extent to which they explicitly state their vision of man or connect that vision with their social conclusions But where two thinkers have virtually identical social analyses and advocacy to include one and exclude the other from the boundaries of a particular set of visions on the basis of their elaboration or nonelaboration of their premises would be arbitrary Moreover it would be inconsistent with our initial definition of a vision as a preanalytic cognitive acta set of assumptions not necessarily spelled out even in the individuals own mind    Seeking operational definitions of the two visions means going beyond suggestive contrasts to decisive distinctions The difference between the tradeoffs commonly found in constrained visions and the solutions found in unconstrained visions is suggestive but not decisive So too is the distinction between seeking the social good through incentives rather than by changing the dispositions of human beingsthis being a special case of tradeoffs versus solutions It is not simply the seeking of tradeoffs but the systemic mode of tradeoffs which is at the heart of the constrained vision A central planning commission or an activist judge can make tradeoffs but this is clearly not what the constrained vision has in mind however congenial that may be to the unconstrained vision    The systemic versus the deliberate mode of social decisionmaking comes closer to the central issue of human capability To allow social decisions to be made as collective decisions by given individuals acting as surrogates entrusted with the wellbeing of others is to claim a much larger capability for man than allowing those social decisions to be whatever systemic interaction produces from the innumerable individuals exercising their own individual discretion in their own individual interests       In short the two key criteria for distinguishing constrained and unconstrained visions are 1 the locus of discretion and 2 the mode of discretion Social decisions remain social decisions in either vision but the discretion from which they derive is exercised quite differently Social decisions are deliberately made by surrogates on explicitly rationalistic grounds for the common good in the unconstrained vision Social decisions evolve systemically from the interactions of individual discretion exercised for individual benefit in the constrained visionserving the common good only as an individually unintended consequence of the characteristics of systemic processes such as a competitive market economy    Both visions acknowledge inherent limitations in man but the nature and degree of those limitations are quite different The need for food the reality of death or the ignorance of newborn babes are of course readily conceded by those with the unconstrained vision What distinguishes those with the constrained vision is that the inherent constraints of human beings are seen as sufficiently severe to preclude the kind of dependence on individual articulated rationality that is at the heart of the unconstrained vision The knowledge the morality and the fortitude required for successful implementation of the unconstrained vision are simply not there according to the constrained visionand are not going to be developed either by the masses or by the elite The best kind of world for man as conceived in one vision is disastrous for man as conceived in the other vision Believers in the two visions are thus foredoomed to be adversaries on one specific issue after another Issues new to both of themsuch as compensatory preferences for disadvantaged groupsevoke the same opposition between them insofar as they depend on the implicit assumptions of different visions      The Constrained Vision     A necessary but not sufficient condition for a constrained vision is that mans intellectual moral and other capabilities are so limited relative to his desires not only for material things but also for justice and love for example that his desires inherently cannot all be fully satisfied However insofar as mans reason is not only capable of grasping this in the abstract for mankind but also of accepting it in the concrete for himself individually and of voluntarily adjusting to it there is no need for social institutions or systemic processes to impose tradeoffs Tradeoffs freely accepted are essentially solutions Such a world would be like that envisioned for the future by Godwin and Condorcet It is the unconstrained vision    For a constrained vision it is necessary not only that 1 mans resources both internal and external are insufficient to satisfy his desires but also that 2 individuals will not accept limits on the satisfaction of their own desires commensurate with what is socially available except when inherent social constraints are forcibly imposed on them as individuals through various social mechanisms such as prices which force each individual to limit his consumption of material goods or moral traditions and social pressures which limit the amount of psychic pain people inflict on each other The second criterionthe need for systemic processes to convey inherent social limitations to the individualapplies to all mankind including the wisest thinker the noblest leader or the most compassionate humanitarian Only when all are included within the human limitations it conceives is the constrained vision complete    Man as conceived in the constrained vision could never have planned and achieved even the current level of material and psychic wellbeing    which is seen as the product of evolved systemic interactions drawing on the experiences and adjusting to the preferences revealed in behavior rather than words of vast numbers of people over vast regions of time The constrained vision sees future progress as a continuation of such systemic interactionsand as threatened by attempts to substitute individually excogitated social schemes for these evolved patterns    The enormous importance of evolved systemic interactions in the constrained vision does not make it a vision of collective choice for the end results are not chosen at allthe prices output employment and interest rates emerging from competition under laissezfaire economics being the classic example Judges adhering closely to the written lawavoiding the choosing of results per sewould be the analogue in law Laissezfaire economics and black letter law are essentially frameworks with the locus of substantive discretion being innumerable individuals      The Unconstrained Vision     The operational definition of an unconstrained vision in terms of locus of discretion and mode of discretion avoids the ultimately impossible task of determining just how unconstrained a vision must be to receive this label Even the classic unconstrained visionssuch as those of Godwin and Condorcetacknowledged human mortality and the existence of erroneous ideas which they actively sought to banish Success in this endeavor would lead ultimately to a society in which the necessary social tradeoffs would be voluntarily accepted individually and so become for all practical purposes solutions Both Godwin and Condorcet acknowledged that even in such a world mans biological capacity to generate an everlarger population would contain the potentiality for producing catastrophic povertybut their crucial premise was that this potentiality would indeed be contained by rational foresight of the consequences1 There would be an abstract tradeoff but a practical solution    It is unnecessary for the unconstrained vision that every single human being individually and spontaneously arrive at this ultimate level of intellectual and moral solution much less that they do so at the same time or pace On the contrary those in the tradition of the unconstrained vision almost invariably assume that some intellectual and moral pioneers advance far beyond their contemporaries and in one way or another lead them toward everhigher levels of understanding and practice These intellectual and moral pioneers become the surrogate decisionmakers pending the eventual progress of mankind to the point where all can make social decisions A special variant in Godwin is that each individual acts essentially as a social surrogate making decisions individually but with social responsibility rather than personal benefit uppermost in his thinking This tradition of social responsibility by businessmen universities and    others implies a capacity to discern the actual social ramifications of ones actsan assumption implicitly made in the unconstrained vision and explicitly rejected by those with the constrained vision2    Central to the unconstrained vision is the belief that within human limits lies the potentiality for practical social solutions to be accepted rather than imposed Those with the unconstrained vision may indeed advocate more draconian impositions for a transitional period than would be accepted by those with the constrained vision But the very willingness of some of those with the unconstrained vision to countenance such transitional methods is predicated precisely on the belief that this is only necessary transitionally on the road to far more freedom and general wellbeing than exist currently    Moreover not all believers in the unconstrained vision accept even a transitional necessity for forcible impositions Godwin repudiated any use of force to bring about the kind of world he wished to see3 and Fabian socialists such as George Bernard Shaw considered it wholly unnecessary at least in England4 In both cases it was not merely that violence was deemed repugnant but that alternative methods were deemed effective The greater intellectual and moral capabilities of man in the unconstrained vision permit a greater reliance on the direct creation of social results by those with the requisite moral commitment and intellectual skills It is this locus of discretion and mode of discretion rather than the presence or absence of violence which defines the vision    Although modes of discretion are related to the locus of discretion they are distinct considerations Fascism for example heavily emphasizes surrogate decisionmaking but is not an unconstrained vision because neither the mode of decisionmaking nor the mode of choosing the leader is articulated rationality It is not merely that nonfascists find fascism non rational but that fascisms own creed justifies decisive emotional ties nationalism race and the use of violence as political driving forces It is only when both the locus of discretion and the mode of discretion consistently reflect the underlying assumptions of either the constrained    vision or the unconstrained vision that a given social philosophy can be unambiguously placed under either rubric    Operational definitions make it more feasible to place social theories especially complex onesunder either constrained or unconstrained visions or to leave them out of both categories for these twin criteria provide a more definitive method than simply surveying an authors isolated remarks on human nature It is after all not simply the presence of particular assumptions but the incorporation of those assumptions into the substantive analysis which determines the nature of a vision    By the standards of locus of discretion and mode of discretion John Rawls A Theory of Justice for example is an unconstrained visioneven though its central theme is the tradeoff between equality and the need to produce material wellbeing In Rawls the locus of discretion is the surrogate decisionmaker society which can choose the tradeoff collectively and arrange results in accordance with principles of justice these principles being derived in explicitly rationalistic terms While the principles of justice are logically derived from the presumed preferences of hypothetical individuals in the original position of the yet unborn deciding what kind of world they would like to inhabit5 the locus of discretion in applying these principles is society or a collective we that is surrogate decisionmakers    Rawls unbiased unborn are similar in function to Adam Smiths impartial spectator from whom principles of morality are derived in The Theory of Moral Sentiments6 In both visions these hypothetical beings are used to circumvent the bias of individual or class selfinterest when deriving social principles The difference is that Smiths impartial spectator is the conscience of each individual who remains the locus of moral as well as economic discretion within a framework of laws and other social constraints also reflecting the moral standards of the same impartial spectator In both visions the hypothetical being defines social principles but the locus of discretion remains real peopleoperating collectively through surrogates in Rawls individually in Smith A social    framework is a collective product in either constrained or unconstrained visions but the ongoing exercise of discretion is what separates them into the selfinterested individual decisionmakers of the constrained vision and the collective surrogate decisionmakers of the unconstrained vision    The terms collective decisionmaking and surrogate decisionmaking are used here more or less interchangeably though they are not precisely the same Town meeting democracy for example would mean collective decisionmaking without surrogates even if officials then carried out the decisions made by the town meeting Referendum government would likewise make possible collective decisionmaking with official surrogates being in principle agents rather than major exercisers of discretion However neither the constrained nor the unconstrained vision devotes much attention to such special cases which are not the situations of complex nationstates Therefore for present purposes the collective surrogate decisionmaking of the unconstrained vision can be contrasted with the individual selfinterested discretion of the constrained vision    A given vision may fall anywhere on the continuum between the constrained and unconstrained visions It may also combine elements of the two visions in ways which are either consistent or inconsistent Marxism and utilitarianism are classic examples of hybrid visions though in very different ways      HYBRID VISIONS       Marxism     The Marxian theory of history is essentially a constrained vision with the constraints lessening over the centuries ending in the unconstrained world of communism7 However at any given time prior to the advent of ultimate communism people cannot escapematerially or morallyfrom the inherent constraints of their own era It is the growth of new possibilities created by knowledge science and technology which lessens these constraints and thus sets the stage for a clash between those oriented toward the new options for the future and those dedicated to the existing society This was how Marx saw the epochal transitions of historyfrom feudalism to capitalism for exampleand how he foresaw a similar transformation from capitalism to communism    This hybrid vision put Marxism at odds with the rest of the socialist tradition whose unconstrained vision condemned capitalism by timeless moral standards not as a once progressive system which had created new social opportunities that now rendered it obsolete    Marx spoke of the greatness and temporary necessity for the bourgeois regime8a notion foreign to socialists with the unconstrained vision for whom capitalism was simply immoral As in more conservative compromises with evil Marxs temporary moral acceptance of past capitalism was based on the premise that nothing better was possiblefor a certain span of past history under the inherent constraints of those times His efforts to overthrow capitalism in his own time were based on the premise that new options now made capitalism both unnecessary and counterproductive      But just as Marx differed from other socialists because he believed in inherent constraints he also differed from those like Smith and Burke who conceived of these constraints as being fixed by human nature To Marx the constraints were ultimately those of material production and the frontiers of those constraints would be pushed back by the march of science and technology Eventually the preconditions would exist for the realization of goals long part of the socialist tradition including the production and distribution of output from each according to his ability to each according to his needs But no such principle could be simply decreed without regard to the stage of economic development and the human attitudes conditioned by it    According to Marx it was only after the productive forces have also increased with the allaround development of the individual and all the springs of cooperative wealth flow more abundantlyonly then can the narrow horizon of bourgeois right be crossed in its entirety and society inscribe on its banner from each according to his ability to each according to his needs9 Marxs vision was therefore of a world constrained for centuries though progressively less so and eventually becoming unconstrained Engels called this the ascent of man from the kingdom of necessity to the kingdom of freedom10    Marxian doctrine as it applies respectively to the past and the future reflects the reasoning respectively of the constrained and the unconstrained visions Looking back at history Marxism sees causation as the constrained vision sees it as systemic rather than intentional In Engels words what each individual wills is obstructed by everyone else and what emerges is something that no one willed11 When referring to the capitalist and pre capitalist past individual intention was as sweepingly rejected as a source of social causation in Marxism as in Adam Smith or any other exemplar of the constrained vision12 Unlike many others on the political left Marx did not regard the capitalist economy as directly controlled by the individual intentions of capitalists but rather as controlling them systemically forcing them to cut prices for example as technology lowered production costs13 or even forcing them to sell below cost during economic crises14    Similarly bourgeois democratic governments were seen as unable to control insurgent political tendencies threatening their rule15    Marxian moral as well as causal conclusions about the past were consistently cast in terms of a constrained vision For ancient economic and social systems slavery and incest were considered by Marx to be historically justified because of the narrower inherent constraints of those primitive times16 Nor would the immediate postrevolutionary regime envisioned by Marx sufficiently escape constraints to decide deliberately when to end the state rather systemic conditions would determine when and how the state would eventually wither away17    Only in some indefinite future was the unconstrained world which Marxism sought expected to be realized In speaking of that world and contrasting its desirable features with those of capitalism Marxs language became that of the unconstrained vision Real freedom of the individual to be realized under Marxian communism meant the positive power to assert his true individuality not merely the bourgeois freedom of the constrained visionthe negative power to avoid this or that    According to Marx and Engels  Only in community with others has each individual the means of cultivating his gifts in all directions only in the community therefore is personal freedom possible18          Looking backward Marx and Engels saw the emergence of bourgeois freedompolitical emancipation from deliberately imposed restrictions as a great step forward though not the final form of human emancipation However such freedom was the final form within the prevailing order of things19that is within the constrained world before communism as conceived by Marx Under capitalism Marx considered the    worker to be only nominally free20 he was compelled by social conditions to work for the exploiting capitalist21 Real freedom was the freedom of the unconstrained vision to be realized in a future unconstrained world This freedom was defined as a result in the manner of the unconstrained vision not as a process in the manner of the constrained vision    Marx was not inconsistent in using the concepts of the constrained vision for his analysis of the past and the concepts of the unconstrained vision for criticizing the present in comparison with the future he envisioned His overall theory of history was precisely that constraints lessened over time with the advancement of science and technology and that social changes followed in their wake22 As a system of contemporary political advocacy it is an unconstrained visiona theory that the ills of our time are due to a wrong set of institutions and that surrogate decisionmakers making collective choices with specifically articulated rationality are the proper locus and mode of discretion for the future      Utilitarianism     Utilitarianism was a hybrid vision in a very different sense from Marxism and to a different degree in its two chief proponents Jeremy Bentham and John Stuart Mill Bentham did not originate the basic concepts of utilitarianism23 but he systematized them incorporated them into a body of political doctrine and founded both an intellectually and politically active school in early nineteenthcentury England John Stuart Mill was the leader of the second generation of that school but was also very consciously seeking to incorporate into his philosophy insights from very different schools of thought Mill was in effect seeking a hybrid vision    Man as conceived by Jeremy Bentham was thoroughly relentlessly and incurably selfish24 But however severe this moral constraint mans intellectual horizons were vast In particular it was within mans power to rationally structure the social universe so as to produce the result of the greatest good for the greatest number The constrained aspect of the utilitarian vision consists of mans inherent moral limitations and the consequent need to rely on better incentives rather than better dispositions in order to reconcile individual desires with social requirements Benthams own efforts were directed toward creating schemes of incentives to be enforced by government whose function was to promote the happiness of the society by punishing and rewarding25    This reliance on surrogate decisionmakers however seems to place Benthams utilitarianism operationally in the category of the unconstrained vision particularly since the mode of discretion was severely rationalistic26 However Benthams advocacy of governmentstructured incentives did not extend to wholesale government control of the economy Indeed Bentham    repeatedly declared himself a believer in the laissezfaire economics of Adam Smith whom he even chided for not carrying laissezfaire far enough when discussing usury laws27 Bentham rejected surrogate decisionmaking in the economy where he argued that a free and rational adult should be unhindered in making any nonfraudulent financial bargain he chose28    Bentham was not consistently in the tradition of either the constrained or the unconstrained vision However the work for which he is best known in law and politics reflects operationally the unconstrained vision though not to the degree of Godwin or Condorcet But Benthams less known and less original work in economics essentially followed the constrained vision of Adam Smiththough not always with Smiths reasons The reason for not allowing legislators to redistribute wealth for example was not that doing such things properly was beyond mans intellectual and moral capabilities but rather that there were specifically articulated reasons against it namely that insecurity of property would reduce subsequent production29    John Stuart Mills respect for Bentham and his carrying onin modified formthe philosophy of utilitarianism which name he popularized30 did not prevent him from criticizing the scope and contents of Benthams vision31 or from deliberately seeking in Samuel Taylor Coleridge an opposite complementary and corrective social vision32 Mill did not share Benthams contempt as Mill saw it of all other schools of thinkers33 Indeed Mill was remarkable among social thinkers in general for the range of other social theorists he not only studied but utilized in forming his own conclusions Even when dealing with theories which he considered to be clearly erroneous he was concerned with seeing that no scattered particles of important truth are buried and lost in the ruins of exploded error34 This intellectual catholicity in Mill led to what might be characterized as either 1 a finely balanced consideration of issues or 2 an inconsistent eclecticism In either case it makes it difficult to put Mill unequivocally in the camp of either the constrained or unconstrained vision though the general thrust of his philosophy was provided by the latter vision Indeed he gave one of the clearest statements of the unconstrained vision in its moral aspect    There are there have been many human beings in whom the motives of patriotism or of benevolence have been permanent steady principles of action superior to any ordinary and in not a few instances to any possible temptations of personal interest There are and have been multitudes in whom the motive of conscience or moral obligation has been paramount There is nothing in the constitution of human nature to forbid its being so in all mankind35          On a number of issues Mill boldly asserted conclusions which derived from the unconstrained vision that laws are made not evolved for examplefollowed immediately by provisos from the constrained vision that these changes in the law will be hopelessly ineffective unless they accord with the traditions and customs of the particular people Similarly with income distribution Mill combined both visions He asserted that unlike laws of production constrained by diminishing returns laws of income distribution are not constrained While opinions and wishes do not affect production they are paramount when it comes to distribution The distribution of output is a matter of human institutions solely Mill declared  The things once there mankind individually or collectively can do with them as they like They can place them at the disposal of whomsoever they please and on whatever terms    The distribution of wealth therefore depends on the laws and customs of society The rules by which it is determined are what the opinions and feelings of the ruling portion of the community makes them and are very different in different ages and countries and might be still more different if mankind so chose36          This seems to be a clear statement of an unconstrained choice based on an unconstrained visionbut it only seems so Mills proviso in this case is that the consequences of particular rules of distribution are beyond mans    controlare as little arbitrary and have as much the character of physical laws as the laws of production37 Constraint has been explicitly repudiated only to be implicitly accepted A similar pattern of bold assertion and devastating proviso appears even in Mills more narrowly technical economic analysis where there is a ringing defense of classical economics on the causes of depressions and the role of money in themfollowed by provisos which repeat essential contentions of the critics38    Much of Mills rhetoric is the rhetoric of the unconstrained vision His provisos from the constrained vision make the classification of his overall position ambiguous      SUMMARY AND IMPLICATIONS     There are many striking features of constrained and unconstrained visions which however do not define them The role of articulation the relative importance of external incentives versus internal dispositions in determining human conduct the meanings of knowledge and of reason the role of fidelity versus sincerityall these show characteristic differences between those with the constrained vision and those with the unconstrained vision However none of these specific features defines the two visions What is at the heart of the difference between them is the question as to whether human capabilities or potential permit social decisions to be made collectively through the articulated rationality of surrogates so as to produce the specific social results desired The crucial issue is ultimately not what specifically is desired a question of value premises but what can in fact be achieved a factual and causeandeffect question though in practical terms goals deemed unachievable are rejected even if conceded to be morally superior in the abstract In the chapters that follow even such apparently valueladen concerns as equality power and justice are analyzed as essentially questions about assumed facts and assumed chains of cause and effect    Pending the ultimate achievement of an unconstrained society the locus of discretion in the unconstrained vision is the surrogate decisionmaker individual or institutional choosing a collective optimum whether in economics law or politics and whether for a limited range of decisions or for the structuring of the whole society By contrast in the constrained vision the loci of discretion are virtually as numerous as the population Authorities exist but their role is essentially to preserve a social framework within which others exercise discretion      The entire spectrum of social visions cannot be neatly dichotomized into the constrained and the unconstrained though it is remarkable how many leading visions of the past two centuries fit into these two categories Moreover this dichotomy extends across moral economic legal and other fields This is highlighted by the fact that those economists for example who hold the constrained vision in their own field tend also to take a constrained vision of law and politics while those with the unconstrained vision of law for example tend to favor economic and political policies which are also consistent with the unconstrained vision This will become more apparent in the chapters that follow Contemporary examples of this consistency across fields are no longer as numerous simply because social thinkers who operate across disciplinary lines are not as numerous The increasing specialization of modern times makes the kind of sweeping visions of the eighteenth century less common today Contemporary visions are more likely to be confined to a particular fieldjudicial activism in law or laissezfaire in economics for examplethough there have been a small and dwindling number of twentiethcentury thinkers such as Gunnar Myrdal or Friedrich Hayek whose writings on a wide range of issues have gone well beyond a single intellectual discipline However what makes a vision a vision is not its scope but its coherencethe consistency between its underlying premises and its specific conclusions whether those conclusions cover a narrow or a broad range    Nevertheless despite the scope and consistency of both constrained and unconstrained visions there are some other very important social visions Marxism and utilitarianism for examplewhich do not fit into either category completely In addition one of the hybrid visions which has had a spectacular rise and fall in the twentieth century is fascism Here some of the key elements of the constrained visionobedience to authority loyalty to ones people willingness to fightwere strongly invoked but always under the overriding imperative to follow an unconstrained leader under no obligation to respect laws traditions institutions or even common decency The systemic processes at the core of the constrained vision were negated by a totalitarianism directed against every independent social process from religion to political or economic freedom Fascism appropriated some of the symbolic aspects of the constrained vision without the systemic processes    which gave them meaning It was an unconstrained vision of governance which attributed to its leaders a scope of knowledge and dedication to the common good wholly incompatible with the constrained vision whose symbols it invoked    Adherents of both the constrained and the unconstrained visions each see fascism as the logical extension of the adversarys vision To those on the political left fascism is the far right Conversely to Hayek Hitlers national socialism Nazism was indeed socialist in concept and execution    Inconsistent and hybrid visions make it impossible to equate constrained and unconstrained visions simply with the political left and right Marxism epitomizes the political left but not the unconstrained vision which is dominant among the nonMarxist left Groups such as the libertarians also defy easy categorization either on a leftright continuum or in terms of the constrained and unconstrained visions While contemporary libertarians are identified with the tradition exemplified by F A Hayek and going back to Adam Smith they are in another sense closer to William Godwins atomistic vision of society and of decisionmaking dominated by rationalistic individual conscience than to the more organic conceptions of society found in Smith and Hayek Godwins views on war see Chapter 7 also put him much closer to the pacifist tendency in libertarianism than to Smith or Hayek These conflicting elements in libertarianism are very revealing as to the difference made by small shifts of assumptions    Godwins profound sense of a moral obligation to take care of ones fellow man39 never led him to conclude that the government was the instrumentality for discharging this obligation He therefore had no desire to destroy private property40 or to have the government manage the economy or redistribute income In supporting private property and a free market Godwin was at one with Smith with Hayek and with modern libertarianism But in his sense of a pervasive moral responsibility to ones fellow man he was clearly at the opposite pole from those libertarians who follow Ayn Rand for example It was the power of reason which made it    unnecessary for government to take on the task of redistribution in Godwins vision for individuals were capable eventually of voluntarily sharing on their own But were reason considered just a little less potent or selfishness just a little more recalcitrant the arguments and vision of Godwin could be used to support socialism or other radically redistributionist political philosophies Historically the general kind of vision found in Godwin has been common on the political left among those skeptical of the free market and advocating more government intervention    Logically one can be a thorough libertarian in the sense of rejecting government control and yet believe that private decisionmaking should as a matter of morality be directed toward altruistic purposes It is equally consistent to see this atomistic freedom as the means to pursue purely personal wellbeing In these senses both William Godwin and Ayn Rand could be included among the contributors to libertarianism    The unconstrained vision is clearly at home on the political left as among G B Shaw and the other Fabians for example or in Edward Bellamys Looking Backward or in the contemporary writings of John Kenneth Galbraith in economics or of Ronald Dworkin and Laurence Tribe on the law But the constrained vision while opposed to such philosophies is also incompatible with the atomism of thoroughgoing libertarians In the constrained vision the individual is allowed great freedom precisely in order to serve social endswhich may be no part of the individuals purposes Property rights for example are justified within the constrained vision not by any morally superior claims of the individual over society but precisely by claims for the efficiency or expediency of making social decisions through the systemic incentives of market processes rather than by central planning Smith had no difficulty with the right of society to regulate individual behavior for the common good as in fire regulations41 for example and Oliver Wendell Holmes declared that the public welfare may call upon the best citizens for their lives42    Neither the leftright dichotomy nor the dichotomy between constrained and unconstrained visions turns on the relative importance of the    individuals benefit and the common good All make the common good paramount though they differ completely as to how it is to be achieved In short it is not a moral value premise which divides them but their different empirical assumptions as to human nature and social cause and effect    Another complication in making these dichotomies of social philosophy is that many twentiethcentury institutions or legal precedents represent thinking that is liberal in American terms or socialdemocratic in European terms so that conservatives who oppose these institutions or precedents are often confronted with the argument that such things are here to stay essentially a conservative principle Those on the political right may thus end up arguing on the ground of the political left that certain policies are irrational while the left defends them as part of the accepted social fabric the traditional position of the right    While these might be simply tactical debating positions in some cases there is a very real philosophic difficulty as well At the extreme the long standing institutions of the Soviet Union were part of the social fabric of that society and communists who opposed reforming them were sometimes considered to be conservative Among fervent American supporters of the freemarket principle libertarians are often at odds with conservatives on welfare state institutions including labor unions which are now part of the American social fabrican argument which carries little or no weight in libertarian thinking though some conservatives find it important    While it is useful to realize that such complications exist it is also necessary to understand that a very fundamental conflict between two visions has persisted as a dominant ideological phenomenon for centuries and shows no signs of disappearing The inevitable compromises of practical daytoday politics are more in the nature of truces than of peace treaties Like other truces they break down from time to time in various parts of the world amid bitter recriminations or even bloodshed      The general patterns of social visions sketched in these chapters in Part I provide a framework for looking more deeply into the application of constrained and unconstrained visions to highly controversial issues involving equality power and justice in the chapters that follow in Part II Finally the role of visions will be assessed against related but very different concepts such as value premises and paradigms      PART II    APPLICATIONS      Chapter 6    Visions of Equality    Equality like freedom and justice is conceived in entirely different terms by those with the constrained vision and those with the unconstrained vision Like freedom and justice equality is a process characteristic in the constrained vision and a result characteristic in the unconstrained vision    From Edmund Burke in the eighteenth century to Friedrich Hayek in the twentieth century the constrained vision has seen equality in terms of processes In Burkes words all men have equal rights but not to equal things1 Alexander Hamilton likewise considered all men to be entitled to a parity of privileges2 though he expected that economic inequality would exist as long as liberty existed3 A social process which assures equal treatment thus represents equality as seen in the constrained vision whether or not the actual results are equal Equal treatment according to Hayek has nothing to do with the question whether the application of such general rules in a particular situation may lead to results which are more favourable to one group than to the others4 There are for Hayek irremediable inequalities5 just as there is irremediable ignorance on everyones part6    The constrained vision of man leads to a constrained concept of equality as a process within mans capabilities in contrast to a results definition of equality which would require vastly more intellectual and moral capacity than that assumed The argument is not that it is literally impossible to reduce or eliminate specific instances of inequality but that the very processes created to do so generate other inequalities including dangerous    inequalities of power caused by expanding the role of government Milton Friedman exemplified this aspect of the constrained vision when he said  A society that puts equalityin the sense of equality of outcome ahead of freedom will end up with neither equality nor freedom The use of force to achieve equality will destroy freedom and the force introduced for good purposes will end up in the hands of people who use it to promote their own interests7          But to those with the unconstrained vision such dangers are avoidable if not illusory and therefore to stop at purely formal processequality is both needless and inexcusable What could be more desirable and just Godwin asked than that the output of society to which all contribute should with some degree of equality be shared among them8 Both visions recognize degrees of equality so the disagreement between them is not over absolute mathematical equality versus some degree of equalization but rather over just what it is that is to be equalized In the unconstrained vision the results are to be equalizedto one degree or anotherwhereas the equality of a constrained vision is the equalization of processes Godwin was prepared to concede some advantages to talents and wealth9 though other believers in the unconstrained vision varied in how far they would go in this direction What they shared was a concept of equalityof whatever degreeas being equality of result When Godwin lamented seeing the wealth of a province spread upon the great mans table while his neighbors have not bread to satiate the cravings of hunger10 he voiced a lament echoed many times throughout the history of the unconstrained vision    Even when equality is phrased as equality of opportunity or equality before the law it still has different meanings in the two visions Although these concepts are expressed in prospective rather than retrospective terms they can be either 1 prospects of achieving a given result or 2 prospects of being treated a given way by the rules of the process      So long as the process itself treats everyone the samejudges them by the same criteria whether in employment or in a courtroomthen there is equality of opportunity or equality before the law as far as the constrained vision is concerned But to those with the unconstrained vision to apply the same criteria to those with radically different wealth education or past opportunities and cultural orientations is to negate the meaning of equality as they conceive it To them equality of opportunity means equalized probabilities of achieving given results whether in education employment or the courtroom    This may require the social process to provide compensatory advantages to some whether in the form of special educational programs employment preference policies or publicly paid attorneys Though the specific issues of affirmative action or comparable worth are quite recent in history the thinking and the vision behind them go back at least as far as the eighteenth century According to Condorcet a real equality requires that even the natural differences between men will be mitigated by social policy11 Without equalized probabilities of achieving given results formal equality was inadequateif not hypocriticalaccording to the unconstrained vision George Bernard Shaw for example ridiculed formal equality of opportunity  Give your son a fountain pen and a ream of paper and tell him that he now has an equal opportunity with me of writing plays and see what he says to you12          Those with the unconstrained vision see no need to neglect at least trying efforts toward equalizing chances for particular results But to those with the constrained vision attempting to single out special individual or group beneficiaries is opening the floodgates to a dangerous principle whose ramifications go beyond the intentions or control of those initiating such a process Again it was not argued that it is literally impossible to reduce specified inequalities seriatim but rather that the generation of new inequalities by this process defeats the overall purpose and creates    additional difficulties and dangers A landmark US Supreme Court decision on preferential treatment rejected the idea that ethnic groups could be ranked by the levels of historic injustice suffered and the compensatory preferences to which they were correspondingly entitled  As these preferences began to have their desired effect and the consequences of past discrimination were undone new judicial rankings would be necessary The kind of variable sociological and political analysis necessary to produce such rankings simply does not lie within the judicial competence   13          The unconstrained vision was expressed by an opposing Justice in the same case without regard to this argument Instead a lengthy elaboration of historic injustices and handicaps suffered was cited as arguments for compensatory preferences to achieve equalization of prospects14 The two visions argued past each other      CAUSATION     For equality to become an issue between the two visions there must first be inequality The existence and persistence of inequality is causally explained very differently by those with the constrained vision and those with the unconstrained vision Many leading exponents of a constrained vision do not explain inequality of result at all while many leading exponents of an unconstrained vision find such inequality both intellectually and morally central    It is not only the existence and persistence of unequal results which have long held the attention of those with the unconstrained vision but the magnitude of these differences as well For Godwin the inequality of property ownership was at an alarming height15 To Shaw for one person to receive three thousand times the rate of pay of another has no moral sense in it16 Moreover it is not only the magnitude of unequal results but the source According to Shaw landlords have become fabulously rich some of them taking every day for doing nothing more than many a woman of sixty years drudgery17 Capitalists likewise were conceived to prosper in much the same way profit being considered simply overcharge18    It was not merely that some have little and others have much Cause and effect are involved Some have little because others have much according to this reasoning which has been part of the unconstrained vision for centuries In one way or another the rich have taken from the poor According to Godwin the great wealth of some derives from taking from others the means of a happy and respectable existence19 Such reasoning    has been applied internationally as well as domestically Imperial Britain was thus a parasite on foreign labor according to Shaw20 The correction of such exploitation has been a central concern in the unconstrained vision    The theme of unjustified taking is not limited to direct employer employee relationships to businessconsumer relationships or to imperialistandcolony relationships When those incapacitated for work those less endowed with bodily strength or mental powerdo not share fully in the fruits of society they are not merely denied compassion but robbed of rights according to Edward Bellamy for most of what makes modern prosperity possible comes from the efforts of past generations  How did you come to be possessors of this knowledge and this machinery which represent nine parts to one contributed by yourself in the value of your product You inherited it did you not And were not these others these unfortunate and crippled brothers whom you cast out joint inheritors coheirs with you Did you not rob them when you put them off with crusts who were entitled to sit with the heirs and did you not add insult to robbery when you called the crusts charity21          The thesis that material deprivation has been aggravated by the infliction of psychic pain has long been a recurring theme in the unconstrained vision In the eighteenth century Godwin declared  Human beings are capable of enduring with chearfulness considerable hardships when those hardships are impartially shared with the rest of the society and they are not insulted with the spectacle of indolence and ease in others no way deserving of better advantages than themselves But it is a bitter aggravation of their own calamity to have the privileges of others forced on their observation and while they are perpetually and vainly endeavouring to secure for themselves and their families the poorest conveniences to find others revelling in the fruits of their labors22            Awareness of inequalities and revulsion toward them have not been confined to those with the unconstrained vision Similar reactions have been common to Adam Smith in the eighteenth century and to Milton Friedman in the twentieth century23 In Friedmans words  Everywhere in the world there are gross inequities in income and wealth They offend most of us Few can fail to be moved by the contrast between the luxury enjoyed by some and the grinding poverty suffered by others24          While both Smith and Friedman as well as others with the constrained vision have proposed various ameliorative schemes to help the poor25 neither was prepared to make fundamental changes in the social processes in hopes of greater equalization A vision of constrained options and greater dangers in alternative processes limits the scope of remedies Moreover these inequalities were not assumed to be products of the given social system which Friedman saw as mitigating rather than aggravating them but as a common misfortune far worse in other systems According to Friedman Wherever the free market has been permitted to operate wherever anything approaching equality of opportunity has existed the ordinary man has been able to attain levels of living never dreamed of before26 While the material abundance of modern capitalist nations has created fortunes here and there its main beneficiaries have been ordinary rather than wealthy people according to Friedman Modern technological wonders brought little improvement to what the rich already had however much they revolutionized the lives of the masses  The rich in Ancient Greece would have benefitted little from modern plumbing running servants replaced running water Television and radiothe patricians of Rome could enjoy the leading musicians and actors in their home could have the leading artists as domestic    retainers Readytowear clothing supermarketsall these and many other modern developments would have added little to their life They would have welcomed the improvements in transportation and in medicine but for the rest the great achievements of Western capitalism have redounded primarily to the benefit of the ordinary person27          In the constrained vision of Friedman and others exploitation situations have been seen as more effectively eliminated by the systemic characteristics of a competitive economy than by the deliberate intervention of political leaders in complex economic processes that they cannot comprehend The danger was not only in the adverse consequences of their intervention on the economy but still more so in the dire consequences of such an increased concentration of political power In short attempts to equalize economic results lead to greaterand more dangerousinequality in political power This was the central theme of Hayeks The Road to Serfdom where the goal of simultaneously combining freedom and equality of outcome in democratic socialism was declared unachievable as a result28 but dangerous as a process change pointing toward despotism    Democratic socialists were not accused of plotting despotism and were in fact regarded by Hayek as genuinely humane individuals lacking the ruthlessness required to achieve their social goals29 but were seen by him as paving the way for othersincluding both fascists and communists who complete the destruction of freedom after the principles of equality before the law and limitations on political power have been fatally undermined in pursuit of the mirage of social justice30    As in other issues while followers of the unconstrained vision speak in terms of the goals being sought followers of the constrained vision speak in terms of the incentives being created by the processes being changed      Irremediable ignorance and irremediable inequality go hand in hand according to Hayek It is precisely our inescapable ignorance that makes general rules necessary31 and general rules of social processes are incompatible with explicit determination of particular individual or group results Those who postulate a personified society32 assume an intention purpose and corresponding moral responsibility where there is in fact an evolved orderand the particulars of a spontaneous order cannot be just or unjust33 Government as a deliberately created entity may act on intention and be morally judged by its acts but not society34 Government as a limited set of decisionmakers cannot possess all the knowledge in a society or anything approaching it and therefore lacks the omniscience in fact to prescribe just or equal results    A society of omniscient persons would have no need for a process conception of justice or equality The social justice of the unconstrained vision could be imposed or agreed to in such a society whereHayek concedesevery action would have to be judged as a means of bringing about known effects35 But the constrained vision of human knowledge precludes the existence of a society with any such capability so that the moral criteria appropriate to such a society become moot The moral principles insisted upon by those with the unconstrained vision are thus rejected not as wrong but as irrelevant to the social choices actually available and dangerous in the concentration of governmental power implied by the pursuit of such ideals    Because it is absurd to demand social justice from an uncontrolled process according to Hayek36 such a demand implies the substitution of a very different kind of process The moral issue thus becomes one of the relative merits of alternative processes Hayek questioned whether it is moral that men be subjected to the power of direction that would have to be exercised in order that the benefits derived by the individuals could be meaningfully described as just or unjust37      In short the constrained vision does not defend existing inequalities or any given pattern of economic or social results as just According to Hayek the manner in which the benefits and burdens are apportioned by the market mechanism would in many instances have to be regarded as very unjust if it were the result of a deliberate allocation to particular people38 The moral justification of the market process rests on the general prosperity and freedom it produces    The issue between the two visions is not simply one of the existence magnitude and persistence of inequalities but also of the extent to which those inequalities are merited This issue like the others goes back for centuries In the eighteenth century Godwin wrote of a numerous class of individuals who though rich have neither brilliant talents nor sublime virtues39 The privileged and powerful readily become indifferent to mankind and callous to their sufferings40 A king is nothing but a common mortal exceeded by many and equalled by more in every requisite of strength capability and virtue41 Garlands and coronets according to Godwin may be bestowed on the unworthy and prostituted to the intriguing42 His target was not simply inequality as such but especially unmerited advantage43 Variations on these themes have remained a prominent feature of the unconstrained vision In the twentieth century Shaw declared that enormous fortunes are made without the least merit44 and noted that not only the poor but many welleducated people see successful men of business inferior to themselves in knowledge talent character and public spirit making much larger incomes45    Because those with the unconstrained vision emphasize the unmerited nature of many rewards it does not follow that those with the constrained vision assume rewards to be individually merited Merit justifications have been very much the exception rather than the rule and largely confined to secondary figures such as Samuel Smiles Horatio Alger and Social Darwinists like William Graham Sumnerall of whom have been explicitly repudiated by Hayek for example46 Nor was Hayek unique The leading figures in the tradition of the constrained vision have for centuries pointed out that many rewards are personally unmerited The moral justification of    the constrained vision is the justification of a social process not of individuals or classes within that process They readily concede that inevitably some unworthy will succeed and some worthy fail that rewards are based only partly on achievements and partly on mere chance47 This is a tradeoff they accept on the conviction that no solution is possible But those with the unconstrained vision do not share that conviction and therefore find acceptance of known inequities intolerable    Although the two visions reach very different moral conclusions they do so not on the basis of fundamentally different moral principles but rather because of their differences in analysis of causes and effects The causal reasons for the inequalities in the first place and the options available for dealing with them are radically different in the two visions Adam Smith and William Godwin were both offended by the privilege and arrogance of the wealthy and powerful in the eighteenth century as Ronald Dworkin and Milton Friedman have both been offended by the economic inequalities of the twentieth century48 The constrained and the unconstrained visions differ however on the plane of causation as to what can be done about it at what cost and with what dangers    Both visions agree that equality of process can mean vast inequalities of results and that equal results may be attainable only by causing processes to operate very unequally toward different individuals or groups The differences between the two visions are in the priority that they attach to each goaland that in turn reflects the extent to which they conceive of man as capable of morally and causally determining the appropriate goal for society One of the bitter contemporary clashes between the two visions in various countries around the world is over compensatory preferences for particular social groups for purposes of enabling those groups to reach results more nearly like those of more fortunate groups in their respective societies Although this specific issue has emerged very recently as history is measured it reflects a conflict of visions that goes back for centuries    The relationship between equality and freedom is also seen in opposite terms in the two visions In the unconstrained vision equality and freedom    are not in conflict but are in fact twin applications of similar principles sometimes summarized as political democracy and economic democracy As results this is clearly so since equalization is central to both concepts As processes it is by no means clear that it is so The constrained vision which focuses on processes sees a major conflict between allowing freedom of individual action and prescribing equality of social results Moreover it is considered illusory in this vision to expect that prescription of economic results can be achieved while maintaining freedom in noneconomic areas49      KINDS OF EQUALITIES AND INEQUALITIES     If individuals were all equal in their developed capabilities and shared the same values and goals then equal processes could produce equal results satisfying both visions But neither vision believes this to be the case Some in both camps believe that innate potentialities do not differ greatly among individuals or groups but this does little to reconcile the conflict of visions since it is not potentialities but the actual application of developed capabilities which determines results    No one believed in the innate equality of human beings more than Adam Smith He thought that men differed less than dogs50 that the difference between a philosopher and a porter was purely a result of upbringing51 and he rejected with contempt the doctrine that whites in America were superior to the blacks they enslaved52 Yet the social inequalities of wealth and status that have been burning issues in the unconstrained vision were of little concern in Smiths constrained vision of man in society He opposed slavery as a social process on both moral and economic grounds53 But such general social results as differences in income and privilege were not deemed sufficiently important to override the process goals of freedom of civil and economic action    Nor was this a matter of partisanship for the wealthy and powerful Smiths low opinion of businessmen has already been noted in Chapter 2 He also repeatedly pointed out how the aristocracy royalty and the privileged or mighty in general were foolishly worshiped by the masses54 even to the point of imitating their vices55and how this huge psychic windfall gain was taken for granted by its recipients who did not even    regard ordinary people as their fellow men56 A distinguished scholar once pointed out that several socialist orations could be put together out of quotations from Adam Smith57 But Smiths constrained vision of man and society led in the opposite directionto laissezfaire capitalism    Adam Smiths sweeping egalitarianism was by no means unique among those with the constrained vision Alexander Hamilton for example had similar views regarding the moral level of different groups  Experience has by no means justified us in the supposition that there is more virtue in one class of men than in another Look through the rich and poor of the community the learned and the ignorant Where does virtue predominate The difference indeed consists not in the quantity but kind of vices which are incident to the various classes   58          To those with the unconstrained vision to say that people are innately equal but that vast differences in economic and social results exist and that privileges are both taken for granted and repaid only in arrogance is to say that the existing society is intolerably unjust and must be drastically changed Some would say that such a system must be changed at all costs or by whatever means are necessary At the very least social mobility must be increased Smith reached none of these conclusions William Godwin once more serves as a perfect counterexample of the unconstrained vision for he agreed completely with Smith on the innate equality of human beings59 on the inequalities of wealth and status60 and on the arrogance of privilege61 but reached opposite conclusions on the need for drastic change though by entirely peaceful means in Godwins case62 The difference between them was in their respective visions of man and of social causation    Many of those with an unconstrained vision and a passionate opposition to inequality of results assume that those who oppose them must be in favor    of inequality of results either on philosophic grounds or as a matter of narrow selfinterest In reality those with the constrained vision may be passionately devoted to certain processes freedom to choose the rule of law etc and only secondarily concerned with whether any particular result is equal or unequal They may not be at all opposed to the advancement of untouchables in India or blacks in the United States or similar groups in other countriesand may even have contributed efforts toward such advancement themselvesbut nevertheless fight strongly against process changes intended by those with an unconstrained vision to aid such advancement    While the belief that peoples capabilities are equal can be found among exponents of both visions so can the belief that these capabilities vary enormously between social groups The view that races classes or sexes innately differ greatly in capabilities would be a conclusion for which a constrained vision would be necessary but not sufficient and is in fact rejected by many for whom intellectual or moral constraints apply to all human beings without group distinction As for developed capabilities these are often conceived as being far more unequal by believers in the unconstrained vision than by believers in the constrained vision    As noted in Chapter 3 the distribution of knowledge and reason is vastly more unequal in the unconstrained vision because its definition of knowledge and reason as articulated information and syllogistic rationality puts them much more in the province of the intellectual elite But the cultural conception of knowledge in the constrained vision makes it far more widely diffused and the systemic logic of cultural evolution and survival in competition dwarfs to insignificance the special logical talents of the intellectual elite Thus while the common man was seen by Hobbes to be more capable in some respects than his more highly educated social superior63 and the latters social claims were at least viewed very skeptically by Smith Friedman and Hayek a vast chasm between the existing intellectual and moral capabilities of the common man and those of the intellectual elite has been an enduring characteristic of the tradition of the unconstrained vision      In an eighteenthcentury world where most people were peasants Godwin declared that the peasant slides through life with something of the contemptible insensibility of an oyster64 Rousseau likened the masses of the people to a stupid pusillanimous invalid65 According to Condorcet the human race still revolts the philosopher who contemplates its history66 In the twentieth century George Bernard Shaw included the working class among the detestable people who have no right to live He added I should despair if I did not know that they will all die presently and that there is no need on earth why they should be replaced by people like themselves67    While the unconstrained vision has featured egalitarianism as a conviction that people should share more equally in the material and other benefits of society it tends to see the existing capabilities of people as far more unequal than does the constrained vision Among contemporary economists proposing ways of advancing Third World nations out of poverty those representing a constrained vision P T Bauer and T W Schultz for example depict the peasant masses of the Third World as a repository of valuable skills and capable of substantial adaptations to changing economic conditions if only the elite will leave them free to compete in the marketplace68 while those further to the left politically such as Gunnar Myrdal depict the peasant masses as hopelessly backward and redeemable only by the committed efforts of the educated elite69    It is only when estimating the potential intelligence of human beings that those with the unconstrained vision have a higher estimate than those with the constrained vision When estimating the current intelligence of human beings those with the unconstrained vision tend to estimate a lower mean and a greater variance It is the greater variance which lends logical support to surrogate decisionmaking whether in the form of more government planning in economics judicial activism in the law or internationalagency efforts at population control or control of natural resources under the sea Counterexamples can be found on both sides of course as for example among the leaders of the French Revolution or V I Lenin in modern times both of whom praised the masses But the public statements of those    holding or aspiring to power are hardly decisive evidence On the other side Burkes famous outburst against the swinish multitude supporting the French Revolution was atypical even of Burke70 much less of the tradition of which he was part    More important it is the logic of each vision rather than the isolated examples which point in the direction each has tended to go Except for that subset who are explicitly racist or Social Darwinists followers of the constrained vision have no reason to expect the kind of vast differences in capabilities which are the logical consequence of conceiving knowledge and reason in ways which make them accessible to the few but not to the many There is no need to question the sincerity of those with the unconstrained vision when they make the wellbeing of the masses their central concern for it is not by choice but by the logic of their assumptions that this wellbeing of the masses is achievable only through the leadership and commitment of the elite    Which vision is more of a vision of equality depends upon the particular aspect of equality considered salient By and large the elite and the mass are closer in capability and morality in the constrained vision while they are more equally entitled to comparable shares of benefits in the unconstrained vision      SUMMARY AND IMPLICATIONS     The crucial difference between the constrained and the unconstrained visions of man is not in their perceptions of people as they are What fundamentally distinguishes the two visions is their respective perceptions of human potential The average person as he exists today is not seen in optimistic terms by those with the unconstrained vision On the contrary some of the most sweeping dismissals of the current capabilities of ordinary people have come from those with the unconstrained vision from Godwin in the eighteenth century to George Bernard Shaw in the twentietheven as they urged sweeping economic equalization Indeed one of the arguments for sweeping equalization of material conditions is that it will enable the masses to improve themselves in addition to enjoying life more fully In short the gap between the actual and the potential is greater in the unconstrained vision than in the constrained vision So too is the gap between the existing masses of people and those who have advanced further toward the intellectual and moral potentialities of man    The concept of equality thus has opposite implications in the two visions To those with the unconstrained vision a greater equalization of material conditions is imperative even if the means of accomplishing this require the more morally and intellectually advanced to restrict the discretion of others in the marketplace or through judicial activism in the law or by other social or political devices The concepts of compassion leadership commitment and rationality are featured prominently in the unconstrained vision    To those with the constrained vision however the gap between the actual and the potential is much smaller and with it there is a correspondingly    smaller difference between the intellectual and moral elite on the one hand and the ordinary person on the other Vast differences may exist within given areas of specializationhence Burkes reverence for authorities within their respective specialties71but believers in this vision have long pointed out areas where ordinary people are greatly superior to intellectuals so that there is no such general superiority as to justify one groups restricting the discretion of others and acting as surrogate decisionmakers for them To those with the constrained vision equality of discretion is more important than equality of condition    The two visions respective estimates of existing human capability intellectual and moral differ not so much in their estimates of the mean as in their estimates of the variance The extent to which the discretion of some should be substituted for the discretion of otherswhether through influence or powerdepends not on the average rationality of man in general but on the differential rationality of different sets of human beings The greater this differential the stronger the case for surrogate decision makers to exercise discretion for others    Where this differential is thought to exist only within given areas of specialization individuals lacking particular expertise may remain free to choose to purchase such expertise as they see fitfrom doctors lawyers photographers etcbut where the differential is thought to be general and pervasive then the layman lacks the prerequisites even for choosing the amount and kind of surrogate decisionmaking needed much less to reject their fundamental principles Thus a more equal world is a better world even if most people prefer inequality72    It is not over the degree of equality that the two visions are in conflict but over what it is that is to be equalized In the constrained vision it is discretion which is to be equally and individually exercised as much as possible under the influence of traditions and values derived from the widely shared experience of the many rather than the special articulation of the few In the unconstrained vision it is the material conditions of life which are to be equalized under the influence or power of those with the    intellectual and moral standing to make the wellbeing of others their special concern      Chapter 7    Visions of Power    The role of power in social decisionmaking has tended to be much greater in the tradition of the unconstrained vision than among those with the constrained vision That is much more of what happens in society is explained by the deliberate exertion of powerwhether political military or economicwhen the world is conceived in the terms of the unconstrained vision As a result unhappy social circumstances are more readily condemned morallybeing the result of someones exertion of powerand more readily seen as things which can be changed fundamentally by the exertion of power toward different goals The constrained vision in which systemic processes produce many results not planned or controlled by anyone gives power a much smaller explanatory role thus offering fewer opportunities for moral judgments and fewer prospects for sweeping reforms to be successful in achieving their goals    Conflicting visions of the role of power are involved in a wide spectrum of issues Power in the sense of direct force and violence is involved not only in issues of war and peace but also in issues of crime and punishment Political power and its efficacy are also storm centers in the conflict of visions The existence magnitude and effectiveness of various economic and social powers are also seen very differently by the two visions Along with differences as to the magnitude pervasiveness or effectiveness of power the two visions differ also as to the degree of inequality with which power is shared or concentrated mitigated or amplified by various social conditions The role of legal rights as bulwarks against power is therefore seen in drastically different terms by those with the constrained and unconstrained visions Moreover power is defined to mean drastically different things in the two visions         FORCE AND VIOLENCE     Force and violence take many forms from crime to war and including the implicit threat of force and violence behind government The causal reasons and moral justifications for force differ completely as between the constrained and the unconstrained visions Reason as an alternative to force likewise plays a different role in the two visions in everything from childrearing to international relations It is not a difference in value premises however Both visions prefer articulated reason to force at a given level of efficacy But they differ greatly in their assessment of the efficacy of articulated reason The use of force is particularly repugnant to those with the unconstrained vision given the effectiveness they attribute to articulated reason    As in other areas of human life the unconstrained vision seeks to discover the special reasons for evils involving force and violencewar and crime for examplewhile the constrained vision takes these evils for granted as inherent in human nature and seeks instead to discover contrivances by which they can be containedthat is to discover the causes of peace or of law and order      War     Given the horrors of war and the frequent outcome in which there are no real winners those with the unconstrained vision tend to explain the existence and recurrence of this manmade catastrophe in terms of either misunderstandings in an intellectual sense or of hostile or paranoid emotions raised to such a pitch as to override rationality In short war results from a failure of understanding whether caused by lack of forethought lack of communication or emotions overriding judgment Steps for a peaceseeking nation to take to reduce the probability of war therefore include 1 more influence for the intellectually or morally more advanced portions of the population 2 better communications between potential enemies 3 a muting of militant rhetoric 4 a restraint on armament production or military alliances either of which might produce escalating countermeasures 5 a deemphasis of nationalism or patriotism and 6 negotiating outstanding differences with potential adversaries as a means of reducing possible causes of war    Those with the constrained vision see war in entirely different terms According to this vision wars are a perfectly rational activity from the standpoint of those who anticipate gain to themselves their class or their nation whether or not these anticipations are often mistaken as all human calculations may be That their calculations disregard the agonies of others is no surprise to those with the constrained vision of human nature From this perspective the steps for a peaceseeking nation to take to reduce the probability of war would be the direct opposite of those proposed by people with the alternative vision 1 raising the cost of war to potential aggressors by military preparedness and military alliances 2 arousal of the public to awareness of dangers in times of threat 3 promotion of patriotism and willingness to fight as the cost of deterring attack 4 relying on your adversaries awareness of your military power more so than on verbal    communication 5 negotiating only within the context of deterrent strength and avoiding concessions to blackmail that would encourage further blackmail and 6 relying more on the good sense and fortitude of the public at large reflecting culturally validated experience than on moralists and intellectuals more readily swayed by words and fashions    Like other evils war was seen by those with the constrained vision as originating in human nature and as being contained by institutions To those with the unconstrained vision war was seen as being at variance with human nature and caused by institutions War was seen by Godwin as being a consequence of political institutions in general1 and more specifically as a consequence of undemocratic institutions War and conquest according to Godwin will never be undertaken but where the many are the instruments of the few    This localization of evil is one of the hallmarks of the unconstrained vision There must clearly be some cause for evils but insofar as these causes are not so widely diffused as to be part of human nature in general then those in whom the evils are localized can be removed opposed or neutralized so as to produce a solution The specifics of this localization whether in undemocratic institutions as in Godwin or in a capitalistic economy as in some modern writersare less crucial than the localization itself which makes a solution possible Evils diffused throughout the human race can only be dealt with by tradeoffs through artificial devices which themselves produce other unfortunate side effects    War as seen in the constrained vision of The Federalist Papers seemed to require virtually no explanation The Federalists considered it axiomatic that if the thirteen recently independent American colonies did not form one nation they would inevitably and incessantly be at war with each other To the Federalists it was obvious that nations in general will make war whenever they have a prospect of getting anything by it2 Far from seeing war as an evil with localized origins in despots they argued that there were almost as many popular as royal wars3 The idea of special causes of war was rejected out of hand    It is sometimes asked with an air of seeming triumph what inducements could the States have if disunited to make war upon each other It would be a full answer to this question to sayprecisely the same inducements which have at different times deluged in blood all the nations in the world4          Within this constrained vision war did not require a specific explanation Peace required explanationand specific provisions to produce it One of these provisions was military power A nation despicable by its weakness forfeits even the privilege of being neutral5 This was the direct opposite of Godwins unconstrained vision in which a nation whose inoffensiveness and neutrality would present no military threat to cause a misunderstanding with other nations or to provoke an attack6 To Godwin the buildup of military power and the forging of military alliances or balanceofpower policies were likely to lead to war7 Godwin deplored the cost of maintaining military forces which included not only economic costs but also such social costs as submission to military discipline8 and the spread of patriotism which he characterized as highsounding nonsense9 and the unmeaning rant of romance10 Within this vision the military man was a lesser man for his occupation11    Within the constrained vision of Adam Smith however the demands on a soldier and the weight of responsibility on him for defending his people elevated his profession to a nobler plane than others12 even though Smith conceded that there is a diminution of humanity when one is repeatedly in a situation where one must either kill or be killed13 This was apparently an acceptable costor tradeoff a solution being impossible Patriotism Smith saw as both natural and beneficial as morally efficient despite his acknowledgment of its perverse side effects14 Again it was a tradeoff that Smith accepted with no sign of seeking a solution      Crime     Crime is another phenomenon seen in entirely different terms by believers in the constrained and unconstrained visions The underlying causes of crime have been a major preoccupation of those with an unconstrained vision of human nature But those with the constrained vision generally do not look for any special causes of crime any more than they look for special causes of war For those with the constrained vision people commit crimes because they are peoplebecause they put their own interests or egos above the interests feelings or lives of others Believers in the constrained vision emphasize social contrivances to prevent crime or punishment to deter it But to the believer in the unconstrained vision it is hard to understand how anyone would commit a terrible crime without some special cause at work if only blindness Condorcet asked  Is there any vicious habit any practice contrary to good faith any crime whose origin and first cause cannot be traced back to the legislation the institutions the prejudices of the country wherein this habit this practice this crime can be observed15         Godwin likewise said It is impossible that a man would perpetrate a crime in the moment when he sees it in all its enormity16 In the twentieth century as well it has been said in a highly acclaimed book that healthy rational people will not injure others17 Within this vision people are forced to commit crimes by special reasons whether social or psychiatric Reducing those special reasons poverty discrimination unemployment mental illness etc is therefore the way to reduce crime    The basic solution for most crime is economichomes health education employment beauty If the law is to be enforcedand rights fulfilled for the poorwe must end poverty Until we do there will be no equal protection of the laws To permit conditions that breed antisocial conduct to continue is our greatest crime18          In both visions the conclusions follow logically from the initial assumptions Both visions also recognize that most people are horrified at certain crimes and would be morally incapable of committing them They differ as to why this is so The constrained vision of human nature sees this revulsion at the thought of committing certain crimes as the product of social conditioninga sense of general morality personal honor and humane feelings all cultivated by the many traditions and institutions of society The unconstrained vision sees human nature as itself averse to crime and society as undermining this natural aversion through its own injustices insensitivities and brutality    Society drains compassion from the human spirit and breeds crime19 according to a modern version of the unconstrained vision Given human nature as seen in the unconstrained vision such crimes as robbery riots rape and mugging are inherently irrational and are explained only by irrational conditions imposed upon the unfortunate segment of society20 Such evils of society as poverty unemployment and overcrowding are the fountainheads of crime21 From this perspective criminals are not so much the individual causes of crime as the symptoms and transmitters of a deeper social malaise  Crime reflects more than the character of the pitiful few who commit it It reflects the character of the entire society22            In this vein the assassinations of John F Kennedy Robert Kennedy and Martin Luther King during the 1960s were regarded as reflections on American society in general not just the particular assassins Those who argued this way often reflected the unconstrained vision in a wide range of social economic and political issues But in the constrained vision of human nature natural incentives to commit crimes are so commonplace that artificial counterincentives must be created and maintainednotably moral training and punishment Adam Smith acknowledged that the infliction of punishment is itself a negative experience to humane individuals but again it was a cost he was willing to paya necessary tradeoff in a situation with no solution  When the guilty is about to suffer that just retaliation which the natural indignation of mankind tells them is due to his crimes when the insolence of his injustice is broken and humbled by the terror of his approaching punishment when he ceases to be an object of fear with the generous and humane he begins to be an object of pity The thought of what he is about to suffer extinguishes their resentment for the sufferings of others to which he has given occasion They are disposed to pardon and forgive him and to save him from that punishment which in all their cool hours they had considered as the retribution due such crimes Here therefore they have occasion to call to their assistance the consideration of the general interest of society They counterbalance the impulse of this weak and partial humanity by the dictates of a humanity that is more generous and comprehensive They reflect that mercy to the guilty is cruelty to the innocent and oppose to the emotions of compassion which they feel for a particular person a more enlarged compassion which they feel for mankind23          But whereas Smith saw the infliction of punishment as a painful duty believers in the unconstrained vision have seen it as an unnecessary indulgence in vengeance a brutalizing throwback to the full horror of mans inhumanity in an earlier time24 With this vision the criminal is seen as a victima miserable victim in Godwins words25first of the    special circumstances which provoked the crime and then of people with a lust for punishment The criminals misfortunes according to Godwin entitle him to something better than the supercilious and unfeeling neglect he is likely to receive26 The death penalty especially imposed on these forlorn and deserted members of the community highlights the iniquity of civil institutions27 True the criminal inflicted harm on others but this was due to circumstancesthese circumstances being the only distinction between him and the highest members of the society28 Within the framework of this vision executions are simply coldblooded massacres that are perpetrated in the name of criminal justice29    Punishment as a tradeoff is barbaric within the framework of the unconstrained vision for there is a solution at hand rehabilitation This is in keeping with the unconstrained visions general emphasis on internal disposition rather than external incentives Punishment Godwin conceded may change a mans behavior but it cannot improve his sentiments Punishment leaves him a slave devoted to an exclusive self interest and actuated by fear the meanest of the selfish passions Were he treated properly his reformation would be almost infallible30 That is he would revert to a natural state of being unable to harm anyone once he really understood what he was doing This view likewise has a contemporary echo that the rehabilitated criminal will not have the capacitycannot bring himselfto injure another or to take or destroy property31 This changed disposition represents a solution whereas punishment represents only a tradeoff There would obviously be no point in accepting a tradeoff unless ones vision of human nature was constrained so as to preclude a solution    Rehabilitation and its prospects of success are seen very differently by the two visions In the unconstrained vision of human nature rehabilitation is a process of returning a person to his more or less natural condition of decencyin principle much like fixing a broken leg which consists largely in putting the leg in condition to heal and restore itself rather than attempting to create a new leg from scratch In the constrained vision however decency is artificial rather than natural and if it has not been    created in the malleable years of childhood it is unlikely to be created later on    In the constrained vision each new generation born is in effect an invasion of civilization by little barbarians who must be civilized before it is too late Their prospects of growing up as decent productive people depends on the whole elaborate set of largely unarticulated practices which engender moral values selfdiscipline and consideration for others Those individuals on whom this process does not takewhether because its application was insufficient in quantity or quality or because the individual was especially resistantare the sources of antisocial behavior of which crime is only one form      THE LOCUS OF DISCRETION     Power lies at the end of a spectrum of causal factors which include influence individual discretion and systemic interactions whose actual outcomes were not planned or controlled by anyone The question as to how much of what happens in the world is caused by the exercise of power is a question as to the locus of discretionwhether among millions of individuals in groups such as the family in structured political institutions or in military forces that ultimately may make or unmake other peoples decisions at gunpoint The causeandeffect question as to where current discretion lies is only one aspect of the role of power The more fundamental conflict of visions is over where the locus of discretion should be    In the unconstrained vision where the crucial factors in promoting the general good are sincerity and articulated knowledge and reason the dominant influence in society should be that of those who are best in these regards Whether specific discretion is exercised at the individual level or in the national or international collectivity is largely a question then as to how effectively the sincerity knowledge and reason of those most advanced in those regards influence the exercise of discretionary decisionmaking Godwin who considered the power of reasonin the articulated syllogistic sense of the unconstrained visionto be virtually irresistible in the long run would diffuse discretion to the individual level confident that the substance of what was to be decided by the many would ultimately reflect the wisdom and virtue of the few However those who have shared the unconstrained vision of man in general but who lacked Godwins conviction as to how effectively the wisdom and virtue of the few would spontaneously pervade the decisions of the many wished to reserve decisionmaking powers in organizations more directly under the control or    influence of those with the requisite wisdom and virtue The unconstrained vision thus spans the political range from the anarchic individualism of Godwin to totalitarianism Their common feature is the conviction that man as such is capable of deliberately planning and executing social decisions for the common good whether or not all people or most people have developed this innate capability to the point of exercising it on their own    The constrained vision sees no such human capability in either the elite or the masses and so approaches the issue entirely differently It is not the sincerity knowledge or reason of individuals that is crucial but the incentives conveyed to them through systemic processes which forces prudent tradeoffs utilization of the experience of the many rather than the articulation of the few It is to the evolved systemic processestraditions values families markets for examplethat those with the constrained vision look for the preservation and advancement of human life The locus of discretion may also range from the individual to the political collectivity among adherents of the constrained vision but the nature of that discretion is quite different from what it is among those with the unconstrained vision    Where adherents of the constrained vision emphasize the freedom of individuals to make their own choicesthe theme of Milton Friedmans Free to Choose for exampleit is to be a choice within the constraints provided by the incentives such as prices conveyed to the individual and derived from the experiences and values of others Where adherents of the unconstrained vision emphasize the freedom of the individual it is either 1 the freedom of those individuals possessing the requisite wisdom and virtueas in John Stuart Mills On Libertyor 2 the freedom of the masses insofar as they are deemed to be under the influence of the moral intellectual exemplars    Neither vision advocates that all individuals be utterly free to act without regard to others It is the nature of what it is that is conveyed to them by othersand by which othersthat differs In the unconstrained vision those with special wisdom and virtue convey this wisdom and virtue to othersthrough articulation where that is deemed effective and through    coercive power where it is not To those with the constrained vision the special wisdom or virtue of moralintellectual exemplars is far less important than the mass experience of the generations embodied in traditional values and the current experiences and economic preferences of the many embodied in prices In the unconstrained vision the ordinary individual is to be responsive to the message of moralintellectual pioneers in the constrained vision the ordinary individual is to be responsive to other ordinary individuals whose rising and falling prices or rising and falling social disapproval convey their experience more effectively than words    Individualism takes on entirely different meanings within the two visions In the constrained vision individualism means leaving the individual free to choose among the systemically generated opportunities rewards and penalties deriving from other similarly free individuals without being subjected to articulated conclusions imposed by the power of organized entities such as government labor unions or cartels But in the unconstrained vision individualism refers to 1 the right of ordinary individuals to participate in the articulated decisions of collective entities and 2 of those with the requisite wisdom and virtue to have some exemption from either systemic or organized social constraints    Mills On Liberty was perhaps the classic statement of the second the right of the moralintellectual pioneers to be exempted from the social pressures of mass opinion He did not believe the reversethat the masses should be exempt from the influence of the moralintellectual elite On the contrary many of his writings emphasized the leadership role of the intellectuals While Mill opposed social intolerance on the part of the many32 he regarded democracy as most beneficial when the sovereign Many have let themselves be guided which in their best times they always have done by the counsels and influence of a more highly gifted and instructed One or Few33    Among contemporary followers of the unconstrained vision individualism likewise centers on exemption of moral and intellectual pioneers from social pressures or even in some cases from laws For    example conscientious objections to military service or militant advocacy of violence in the face of perceived social injustice are among the exemptions Ronald Dworkin justifies while denying that racial segregationists have any corresponding rights to violate civil rights laws34    All these views on both sides are consistent with their initial premises If man has moralintellectual capabilities far in advance of those currently manifested in the mass of ordinary people then the special wisdom and virtue of those who have already gone much further in the direction of those human potentialities must not only be made the basis for the decisions of others whether by influence or power but must itself be exempted to some extent from the social control of retrograde masses and perhaps even from some laws reflecting retrograde views But if the knowledge virtue and wisdom that matter most are those deriving from the experience of the masses whether expressed in traditions constitutions or pricesas claimed in the opposing constrained visionthen the most that each individual can expect is to be left free to choose among the various rewards and penalties which emerge from systemic social processes not exemption from any of them      The Economy     The constrained vision sees market economies as responsive to systemic forcesthe interaction of innumerable individual choices and performances rather than to deliberate power shaping the ultimate outcome to suit particular individuals or organized decisionmakers A competitive market as thus conceived is a very efficient system for the transmission of accurate information in the form of prices35 These prices not only bring information as to changing scarcities technological advances and shifting consumer preferences but also provide an incentive to react to the information according to Milton Friedman36 The unconstrained vision argues that this is not how the economy operates that it is currently obeying the power of particular interests and should therefore be made in future to obey the power of the public interest Deliberate pricesetting exists in the most basic American industries according to this view The answer is for an angry public to appeal to its political government37 Thus the market gods are increasingly brought within control of humanely exercised power38    The point here is not to resolve this contradiction but rather to indicate how completely different are the worlds envisioned by those who see the role of power differently The locus of discretion is in one case scattered among millions in the other concentrated in a few large corporate hands exercised by corporate managements in an impregnable position according to John Kenneth Galbraith39 Each dismisses the others vision as a myth40    It is hardly surprising that the reasons why government exercises power in the economy also differ between the two visions In the unconstrained    vision it is a matter of intentions while in the constrained vision it is a matter of incentives The governments intention to protect the public interest forces it to intervene in the economy to undo the harm done by private economic power according to the unconstrained vision But the governments inherent incentive to increase its own power leads it into intervention that is often both unneeded and harmful according to the constrained vision Incentives are central to the constrained visionthe prime problem of politicians is not to serve the public good but to get elected to office and remain in power41    These different conclusions apply not only to the industrialized nations in which such controversies have long been prominent but also to analyses of the poorer less industrialized Third World Diametrically opposite views on the causes and cures of Third World poverty reflect the same underlying differences of opinion on the nature of man the role of knowledge the capabilities of the elites and masses which characterize the conflict of visions in many other areas They of course disagree also on the role of power    For convenience the late Nobel Prizewinning economist Gunnar Myrdal can be considered as representative of the school of thought which has regarded political power and discretion as the key to the advancement of the poorer countries The opposite viewthe constrained visionhas long been exemplified by the distinguished economist from the London School of Economics Lord Peter Bauer It is not merely in their conclusions but in a wide variety of underlying assumptions that they differ    They differ at the most fundamental level on the very question as to what it is that is to be explained Myrdal has sought to discover those conditions in the Third World countries which are responsible for their underdevelopment42 But rather than try to explain the lesser development of much of the world compared to the industrialized west Bauer has instead sought to explain the causes of prosperity and development refusing to designate the position of the great majority of mankind as abnormal43 To Myrdal it is poverty which needs explaining to Bauer it is prosperity       To Myrdal articulated rationality is crucial to development which must be rationally coordinated in ways made more explicit in an overall plan44 This planning must continually reconcile competing interests and determine the order of precedence among them45 In short the discretion of surrogates must determine the tradeoffs But to Bauer economic performance and political articulation are completely different qualities  The market system delivers the goods people want but those who make it work cannot readily explain why it is so The socialist or communist system does not deliver the goods but those who operate it can readily explain away its failure46          The relationship between the intellectualmoral leaders and the masses in the Third World is seen in the classically different terms which have marked the constrained and the unconstrained visions for centuries though the specific economic problems of the Third World are a relatively recent issue Myrdal has been very concerned 1 to promote greater material equality within the Third World and between Third World and industrialized nations47 and 2 to enhance the influence and power of the westernized classes to cause the Third World masses to change their whole way of life and values so as to increase material advancement48 In short his immediate concern is for greater economic equality and simultaneously a shift in the locus of discretion to the intellectualmoral leaders the westernized intellectuals    To Myrdal without more social and economic equality mere political democracy would be an empty achievement49 His goal has been not simple equalization of processes but equalization of results Moreover regulations backed by compulsion50 must be used to move the masses for economic development cannot be achieved without much more social discipline than the prevailing interpretation of democracy would permit51    The resistance to change of the masses52 must be overcome Because of hardened resistance to change throughout Third World societies modernism will not come about by a process of natural evolution but only by radical state policies to engender development by state intervention53 It is not the masses themselves but those who think and act on their behalf54 who must direct economic development    In short this very modern controversy over Third World development elicits from Myrdal a centuriesold vision which combines economic equality and political inequality giving power to intellectualmoral surrogate decisionmakersin short the unconstrained vision At the same time it elicits from Bauer all the key features of another centuriesold viewpoint the constrained vision    To Bauer the Third World masses have repeatedly demonstrated their responsiveness to systemic economic incentives55 He rejects condescension toward the ordinary people of the Third World56 the classification of groups as helpless57 and the notion that they do not know what is good for them nor even what they want58 a view which denies identity character personality and responsibility to them59 To Bauer the evidence refutes the suggestion that individual Africans and Asians cannot or do not take a longterm view60 He notes that proposed sacrifices are not borne by those who so warmly advocate their imposition61 To Bauer the intellectuals so highly regarded by Professor Myrdal were seen as a special danger rather than a special source of progress for their attempts to iron out differences in culture language status wealth and income and to dissolve the bonding agents of society could only lead to an extreme concentration of power62 Their hostility to the market and contempt for ordinary people are to him only two sides of the same coin63 Bauer rejects Myrdals conception of man and society in general and in particular Myrdals practice of regarding poorer people as helpless victims of society64      Whether Myrdal or Bauer is more in favor of equality depends entirely on whether equality is conceived as equality of economic results or equality of political process Myrdal clearly believes more in equality of economic resultsand Bauer equally clearly prefers equality of social processes In this they are very representative of historic visions even though contending over modern issues    Their respective conceptions of power are likewise in the tradition of the two conflicting visions According to Myrdal power has shaped economic results in the Third World for not only have Western nations exploited the resources and peoples in the huge backward areas of the world and kept them politically and economically dependent65 but also domestically swarms of money lenders and middlemen have too many of South Asias peasants in their grip today66 There is economic power by the Chinese minority in Malaysia67 for example Economic planning is said to have failed when it did not lead to a lessening of the concentration of economic power68 Bauer by contrast rejects the whole concept of economic power in a competitive market  The market order minimizes the power of individuals and groups forcibly to restrict the choices of other people Forcible restriction of the choice of others is what coercion means Possession of wealth does not by itself confer such power on the rich Indeed in modern market economies the rich especially the very rich usually owe their prosperity to activities which have widened the choices of their fellow men including those of the poor Obvious examples are the fortunes made in mass production and mass retailing69          Note that there is not simply a disagreement between Myrdal and Bauer on an empirical issue as to the magnitude or locus of power but also and more fundamentally a different conception of what power consists of As with equality freedom and justice power is defined as a result characteristic in the unconstrained vision Myrdal and as a process characteristic in the constrained vision Bauer Bauers definition of    coercion or power as restrictions of the choices of othersa process definitionis one that Myrdals examples do not even attempt to meet Such results as being economically dependent are sufficient for Myrdals purposes as evidence of being subjected to economic power Implicitly this is a definition of power advanced long ago by Max Weber endorsed more recently by John Kenneth Galbraith and generally characteristic of the unconstrained visionthe possibility of imposing ones will on the behavior of other persons70 The two definitions may seem at first to be very similar but they are in fact quite different    Whenever A can get B to do what A wishes then A has power over B according to the resultsoriented definition of the unconstrained vision For example two modern theorists say A Controls the responses of B if As acts cause B to respond in a definite way Even when a subordinate negotiates with another employer in order to induce his superior to grant him a raise that is Control with a capital C in these authors terminology or power71 It is the result which defines power But if B is in a process in which he has at least as many options as he had before A came along then A has not restricted Bs choices and so has no power over him by the process definition used by Bauer and characteristic of the constrained vision The offer of some specific quid pro quo by A to B would be an exercise of power according to Galbraith72 but not according to Bauer for A has only enlarged Bs options rather than restricted them Even if the new option offered by A is so superior to Bs existing options as to make Bs choice virtually a foregone conclusion a quid pro quo is still not power by this definition Whether in a Third World context or otherwise arguments about the magnitude and locus of economic power are not simply disputes about empirical facts but go back to a basic conflict of visions and a conflict of definitions derived from those different visions    Because the ability to affect particular results in one way or another is much more widespread than the ability to shape whole social processes power is a more pervasive feature of the unconstrained vision than of the constrained vision In modern times the concept of economic power has been predominantly associated with those who on other grounds as well    are in the tradition of the unconstrained vision while those with the constrained vision remain skeptical if not dismissive of such a concept The salient point here is that how much power exists in whatever context depends upon how power is defined More important the appropriate policy response to power depends upon what it is substantively that is being responded to not the word used to describe it73    To those with the constrained vision to deal with the problems of an economic process in which power is at most attenuated by increasing and concentrating political power that is very real is to reduce rather than increase human freedom But to those with the unconstrained vision with a different conception of power the exercise of political power is pale in contrast with that exercised by concentrated and organized property interests74 They use the same word but they are talking about two different things overlapping just enough to be confused with one another      The Law     In many legal cases the most fundamental decision is who should decide in short the locus of discretion The question of narrow versus expansive judicial interpretation of the Constitution is ultimately a question as to whether the courts should restrict themselves as much as possible to defining boundaries within which others may exercise relatively uninhibited choices or whether instead the courts should reserve to themselves broad powers to review those choices with respect to their arbitrariness or reasonableness bias or good faith duress or freedom or equality or inequality of bargaining power between the parties concerned The locus of discretion under the law is one of the many questions seen in radically different terms by those with the constrained vision and those with the unconstrained vision    To those with the constrained vision the locus of discretion should be as much as possible with those individuals and organizations directly concerned and systemically responsible for the consequences in the sense of personally gaining or losing Once the law has drawn the boundaries of their discretion courts should be very reluctant to secondguess their choices Even if the decisions made were clearly for the purposes of avoiding taxes for example the real questionaccording to Oliver Wendell Holmeswas whether they were within the legal boundaries of individual discretion for the very meaning of a line in the law is that you intentionally may go as close to it as you can if you do not pass it75    This principle was applied to many kinds of cases Within limits someone who makes a will may be a despot with his property according to Holmes76 Within the bounds of their discretion state legislatures may pass laws so foolish as to kill a goose that lays golden eggs Holmes    declared Intelligent selfinterest he noted is not a constitutional duty77 He said it by no means is true that every law is void which may seem to the judges who pass upon it as excessive78 Nor was Holmes prepared to condemn legally someone who killed an assailant even though his action may seem to have been unnecessary when considered in cold blood afterward Detached reflection cannot be demanded in the presence of an uplifted knife he said79    In all these very disparate cases the underlying premise was that once the law had drawn the boundaries of discretion courts should avoid second guessing the actual exercise of that discretion Given the assumptions of the constrained vision the principle could hardly be otherwise It is the legal equivalent of laissezfaire in economics based essentially on the same vision of man and society    To those with the unconstrained vision such holding back by courts is simply allowing injustice to flourish unnecessarily Laurence Tribe and Ronald Dworkin are among the most prominent contemporary advocates of this view Ronald Dworkin sees a need for courts to go beyond demarcation of the boundaries within which other branches of government exercise their own discretion According to Dworkin there must be a fusion of constitutional law and moral theory80again based on values found in the Constitution rather than only on explicit rules of procedure prescribed by that document According to Ronald Dworkin courts must supply fresh moral insight when judging the acts of Congress the states and the President81 If someone has a moral right to an equal education then it is wrong for the state not to provide that education and courts should rule accordingly82 This view is skeptical of the supposed natural right to the use of property83 and dismisses the liberty of an employer to hire workers on such terms as he wishes as not entitled to constitutional protection from statutory law84    To those with the unconstrained vision it is not simply a question of the locus of discretion but also of the morality reasonableness and equality or    inequality with which that discretion was exercised If third parties are able to make such judgments as the unconstrained vision assumes those with the power to change these decisions have little justification for their failure to do so    Laurence Tribe likewise rejects the substancedenying idea of courts limiting themselves to drawing boundaries defining acceptable procedures without judging the substance of what those procedures produce within those boundaries85 Judges should question the tradeoffs arrived at by the political branches of government rather than be satisfied if due process is observed within the boundaries of legislative and executive discretion86 It is not enough that explicit constitutional rules are followed implicit constitutional values are to be discerned and applied by judges to the substance of decisions made by others While discerning implicit values is inherently subjective legal process cannot be emptied of substance or subjectivity according to Tribe87    The fact that particular rulings have particular effects means for Tribe that implicit choices have been made as to the substance For example protection of property rights means in effect immunizing from majoritarian rearrangement extant distributions of wealth and economic power88 Thus the US Supreme Court by overruling state laws infringing property rights reinforced the protection of existing patterns of capital distribution89 There is a deep bias against economic redistribution in constitutional requirements for just compensation by government when private property is taken under eminent domain90 The laws builtin bias against redistribution of wealth is seen as a benefit to entrenched wealth91that is it is seen in terms of its individual results rather than in terms of the social processes facilitated by a propertyrights system of economic decisionmaking    By contrast legal theorists who support property rights defend them on the entirely different ground that they have an effect on the efficiency with which the economic system operates92 It is not the retrospectively    observed results for particular individuals or classes but rather the prospective incentives created throughout societythe effect of property rights on the penaltyreward system93that is central in the opposing vision In short Tribe does not simply reach a different conclusion but argues on an entirely different ground from those with the constrained vision    According to Tribe seemingly neutral principles of the law betray a tilt decidedly in the direction of existing concentrations of wealth and influence94 What is needed is a more substantive conception of equality for equality is essential to the Constitutions protection of free speech and association95 As in other versions of the unconstrained vision in other fields so in the law it is not the process but the result which defines equality According to Tribe free speech has not been available at all96 Because inexpensive methods of communication such as leafletting picketing and soapbox orating have given way to expensive media such as electronic broadcasting newspaper advertising and direct mail97 freedom of speech as a process does not mean freedom of speech as a result While there is equality of voting there is not equality of voice98    Economic power and institutional participation are central to this reasoning The importance of both is denied by those with the constrained vision who see the power of a corporation as a delusion and participation in collective decisionmaking as often inefficient99 Once again the points of disagreement are not purely empirical because power in the constrained vision means an ability to reduce someone elses options It is the existence of power in this sense that is denied  What then is the content of the presumed power to manage and assign workers to various tasks Exactly the same as one little consumers power to manage and assign his grocer to various tasks The single consumer can assign his grocer to the task of obtaining whatever the customer can induce the grocer to provide at a price acceptable to both parties That is precisely all that an employer can do to an employee100            Because the employer cannot reduce the employees preexisting set of options he does not have power over him in this conception But to those with the unconstrained vision power or force is not defined in these process terms In the unconstrained vision where results rather than processes are central if As chosen behavior changes Bs behavior then A has forced B to behave in a particular way For example according to Tribe if the government refuses to pay for abortions for indigent women then it causes coerced childbirth acting in effect to conscript women at least poor women as involuntary incubators thereby denying women power over both their bodies and their futures101 This is consistent with the general logic of defining power in terms of the ability to change someone elses behavior though inconsistent with the definition of power as the reduction of preexisting options In the latter sense the government would be exercising power over pregnant women if it forbade abortions but not when it simply declined to pay for them    The clash of the two concepts of power is especially sharp in legal issues in which governmental power is put at the disposal of private parties to enforce contracts or property rights Where the terms of contracts have been privately and voluntarily agreed to the locus of discretion is in the private sectorboth initially and when a breach of contract presents to the aggrieved party the option of resorting to the enforcement power of the state Similarly when property rights are trespassed the locus of discretion is with the individual propertyowner who may choose to ignore the trespass or to invoke state power to eject andor prosecute the trespasser    In a landmark case involving state action at the behest of an aggrieved private party a woman handing out leaflets in a privately owned residential development in defiance of the developments rules against it was arrested for trespass In the constrained vision and the judicially restrained view of the law based upon it the central question for the court to decide was whether the state action requested was within the boundaries of the    owners property rights But in the more judicially activist view of the opposing vision the court should inquire into whether the state action requested was consonant with the values emanating from the Constitution not simply whether it was consonant with the explicit rules written there Among these constitutional values would be freedom of speech under the First Amendment which explicitly forbade government but not private individualsfrom restricting communications    In this particular caseMarsh v Alabama 1946the US Supreme Court overruled the trespass conviction on grounds of freedom of speech In subsequent cases involving similar trespass in shopping centers the Supreme Court decision sometimes went one way and sometimes the opposite way102 What is relevant here are the rationales for each position and how they relate to the underlying conceptions of power and the locus of discretion in applying it Where the states enforcement of trespass laws is procedurally correct as an application of explicit property rights those with the unconstrained vision have nevertheless argued that the courts should refuse to countenance state action when the net result will be to deny someone the exercise of free speech on that property or to exclude someone from that property because the owner does not like people of that race Like so many issues between those with constrained and unconstrained visions state action cases turn on whether it is process or result that is paramount    While conceding that the Constitution does not directly concern itself with private actors Laurence Tribe nevertheless declares that to put private actors in a position to inflict injury by resort to state power under trespass laws makes the state guilty of the substantive result103 Thus state action can be a subterfuge for substantive choices104 But to those whose constrained vision limits what man should attempt to making processes operate according to agreed principles the only question is whether the legal boundaries of property rights were rightly drawn not what substantive result occurred within the bounds of the discretion permitted the owner There are echoes of Oliver Wendell Holmes in a latterday Supreme Court Justices dissenting opinion that the right to use and dispose of his property    as he sees fit means that within those boundaries the owner has the legal right to be irrational arbitrary capricious even unjust105      SUMMARY AND IMPLICATIONS     The role of various forms of power is seen very differently by those with the constrained and the unconstrained visions The amassing of military power by a peaceful nation is dangerously counterproductive according to the unconstrained vision and absolutely essential to preserve peace according to the constrained vision These opposing views are as common today as they were in the eighteenth centuryand as highly correlated with their proponents respective positions on unrelated domestic social issues involving income and wealth differences or crime and punishment Even issues of more recent vintage such as abortion or Third World development divide controversialists along lines reflecting different underlying assumptions that go back for centuries    The constrained vision of human intellectual and moral capabilities relies less on articulated rationality to convince and more on incentives to influence behavior This vision sees unprovoked aggressionwhether by criminals or nationsas something to be systemically deterred rather than something that can be rooted out by better understanding conveyed to those lacking it or by defusing emotions which might otherwise override judgment Neither criminals warmakers nor Third World peoples are seen as requiring or likely to derive much benefit from the articulated rationality of the intellectually or morally advanced segments of society Nor is the law seen as benefiting from their fresh insights being substituted for the implicit wisdom of systemically evolved procedures    By contrast the unconstrained vision necessarily sees a larger gap between current human capabilities and the ultimate intellectual and moral potential of the species It is consistent with if not entailed by this vision    that the existing intellectual and moral variance between the ordinary person and those who have traveled further along the road toward larger human potentialities would be greater than in the constrained vision This imposes on the elites a duty to seek more influence on the course of events whether in law international relations or Third World development In this context deference to less advanced popular beliefs or ancient institutions and traditions would be an almost fetishistic abdication of responsibility This is especially so where resort to force or the threat of force is involved Proposals that they observe such deference often evokes amazement scorn or even a questioning of the honesty of those who make such proposals which are indeed irrational given the assumptions of the unconstrained vision But those who make such proposals are often operating under entirely different assumptions    Contemporary controversies revolving around differences in the very conception of power often go back to centuriesold differences in the visions of man and social causation Whenever one individual or group can change the behavior of another then the former has power over the latter as power is conceived by J K Galbraith Gunnar Myrdal Laurence Tribe or other modern thinkers in the tradition of the unconstrained vision Those with the constrained vision reject this conception of power when behavioral changes are made in response to a quid pro quo and conceive of power as the ability to reduce someones preexisting options The result may be the same in both cases whether achieved by threat or reward but the constrained vision is not a vision of results but of processes    If one conceives it to be within the capabilities of man to control the exercise of power and to limit it to socially desirable results as those with the unconstrained vision do then it is arbitrary to do so only with power defined as the ability to reduce preexisting options But if monitoring the desirability of myriad individual results is in general beyond the capabilities of any individual or council as those with the constrained vision assume it to be then efforts to produce social benefits must focus on general processes and on power restrictionsmeaning restricting the ability of some to reduce the options of others      Both visions see the abuses of power whether direct force or in other social forms They disagree widely and fundamentally on the means of controlling it      Chapter 8    Visions of Justice    Adam Smith and John Rawls each made justice the prime virtue of a society but they said it in such different senses as to mean nearly opposite things Moreover the differences between them were not due simply to their very different conceptions of what constituted justicea process in Smith a result in Rawlsbut more fundamentally were due to how they wanted the principle of justice applied According to Rawls  Justice is the first virtue of social institutions as truth is of systems of thought A theory however elegant and economical must be rejected or revised if it is untrue likewise laws and institutions no matter how efficient and wellarranged must be reformed or abolished if they are unjust Each person possesses an inviolability founded on justice that even the welfare of society as a whole cannot override For this reason justice    does not allow that the sacrifices imposed on a few are outweighed by the larger sum of advantages enjoyed by many    The only thing that permits us to acquiesce in an erroneous theory is the lack of a better one analogously an injustice is tolerable only when it is necessary to avoid an even greater injustice Being first virtues of human activities truth and justice are uncompromising1         Rawlsian justice is not to be traded off even for the existence of an otherwise wellrun society Others with a similar vision speak of rights based on justice as trumps which invariably prevail over other social considerations2 There are different values of trumps so that one must give way to another but all trumps prevail over all nontrumps The superior claims of justice have been part of the unconstrained vision as far back as    William Godwin3 Those with this vision may differ among themselves as to the specifics of justice as there are differences within the tradition of the constrained vision as well and they differ especially as to the extent to which government is the instrumentality of enforcing these moral principles4 But what is consistent in the unconstrained vision is that 1 justice is categorically paramount and that 2 rights derived from justice inhere in individuals and for individuals    A very different view of justice is found in the constrained vision of Adam Smith who said society cannot subsist unless the laws of justice are tolerably observed5 Smith asserted  Society may subsist though not in the most comfortable state without beneficence but the prevalence of injustice must utterly destroy it6          Justice thus derived its importance from the need to preserve society not society its raison dtre from the need to produce justice Moreover justice need only be tolerably observed to serve its social function of maintaining order and that overriding need for social order was due to the limitations of man According to Smith  Men though naturally sympathetic feel so little for another with whom they have no particular connection in comparison to what they feel for themselves the misery of one who is merely their fellow creature is of so little importance to them in comparison even of a small convenience of their own they have it so much in their power to hurt him and may have so many temptations to do so that if this principle justice did not stand up within them and overawe them into a respect for his innocence they would like wild beasts be at all times ready to fly upon him and a man would enter an assembly of men as he enters a den of lions7            Here the elements of Smiths constrained vision stand out in stark contrast to those of the unconstrained vision While man as conceived by Smith had natural sympathythat was the cornerstone of the moral code elaborated in his Theory of Moral Sentimentsthis sympathy and mans reason serve to provide mankind with general principles for society rather than with direct restraints on individual behavior Where derived and refined principles of justice serve as an individual restraint it is not because of sympathy and reason but because the social inculcation of justice serves to overawe the individual Because society cannot subsist among those who are at all times ready to hurt and injure one another8 justice is instrumentallysocietys prime virtue    The instrumental nature of justice and its consequent subordination at times to other social imperatives is a recurring theme in the constrained visionand is anathema to the unconstrained vision Implicit in this subordination of justice to order in the constrained vision is the conclusion that man will suffer more by the breakdown of ordereven an unjust order than by some injustices Those with the constrained vision accept this tradeoff because the inherent limitations of man as they conceive man leave no solution to hope for In this vision of incremental tradeoffs the categorical concept of trumps is completely inapplicable      LEGAL JUSTICE       The Constrained Vision     Oliver Wendell Holmes illustrated the way in which the inherent limitations of human beings were central to the concept of legal justice as seen in the constrained vision  The law takes no account of the infinite varieties of temperament intellect and education which make the internal character of a given act so different in different men It does not attempt to see men as God sees them    If for instance a man is born hasty and awkward is always having accidents and hurting himself or his neighbors no doubt his congenital defects will be allowed for in the courts of heaven but his slips are no less troublesome to his neighbors than if they sprang from guilty neglect His neighbors accordingly require him at his proper peril to come up to their standard and the courts which they establish decline to take his personal equation into account9         Holmes thus established two standards of justiceand deliberately chose the lower standard as the proper one for human beings to administer given the inherent limitations of man It was a conscious tradeoff of justice for the interest of the society as a whole Holmes said justice to the individual is rightly outweighed by the larger interests on the other side of the scales10 He opposed confounding morality with law11 Law existed to preserve society Criminal justice for example was primarily concerned with deterring crime not with finely adjusting punishments to the individual  Public policy sacrifices the individual to the general good It is desirable that the burden of all should be equal but it is still more    desirable to put an end to robbery and murder12         Once again Holmes rejected the higher standard of justicethe desirable tailoring of punishment to the individualin favor of the lower standard of justice Implicit in putting aside the solution in favor of the tradeoff was the assumption that the solution was beyond human capability a point already made explicitly in his discussion of civil liability where the courts of men were said to have to operate differently from the courts of heaven Even when the civil law prescribed the forcible sterilization of the mentally incompetent to prevent their breeding more incompetents Holmes on the Supreme Court sustained the law in the name of the public welfare declaring Three generations of imbeciles are enough13    Law as Holmes conceived it was not the deliberate logical creation of great minds but rather represented the evolved and codified experience of vast numbers of people  The life of the law has not been logic it has been experience    The law embodies the story of a nations development through many centuries and it cannot be dealt with as if it contained only the axioms and corollaries of a book of mathematics14          Holmes did not deny that there was logic in law or that great minds had in fact contributed to its development nor did he fatalistically accept whatever law existed He in fact became famous as the great dissenter on the Supreme Court I venerate the law he said but one may criticise even what one reveres15 What Holmes denied was that law had historically evolved by the application of logic though there was a general logic in its propositions arising systemically He recognized the countless number of great intellects that have spent themselves in making some addition or improvement in the lawthe greatest of which he said is    trifling when compared to the mighty whole16 Here as in other areas of the constrained vision it is the experience of the many rather than the brilliance of the few that is to be relied upon and historical evolution rather than excogitated rationality that is paramount    The social benefits of known law as a framework within which the many could make their own decisions were weighed in a similar fashion by the celebrated English legal theorist of the eighteenth century William Blackstone The tradeoff between individual justice and the social benefits of certainty was particularly striking within the British legal tradition where courts of equity were institutionally distinguished from courts of lawthe former to make exceptional adjustments for the sake of individual justice Blackstone said  Equity thus depending essentially upon the particular circumstances of each individual case there can be no rules and fixed precepts of equity laid down without destroying its very essence and reducing it to positive law And on the other hand the liberty of considering all cases in an equitable light must not be indulged too far lest thereby we destroy all law and leave the decision of every question entirely in the breast of the judge And law without equity tho hard and disagreeable is much more desirable for the public good than equity without law which would make every judge a legislator and introduce most infinite confusion as there would be almost as many rules of action laid down in our courts as there are differences of capacity and sentiment in the human mind17          The parallel of such reasoning with other conclusions in the tradition of the constrained vision was not merely coincidental Blackstones vision of man was that his reason is corrupt and his understanding full of ignorance and error To Blackstone the frailty the imperfection and the blindness of human reason18 made it an unreliable instrument for the direct creation of law Reason was necessary but not sufficient When Blackstone said what is not reason is not law he added immediately    Not that the particular reason for every rule in law can at this distance of time be always precisely assigned but it is sufficient that there be nothing in the rule flatly contradictory to reason and then the law will presume it to be well founded And it has been an antient observation in the laws of England that whenever a standing rule of law of which the reason perhaps could not be remembered or discerned hath been wantonly broke in upon by statutes or new resolutions the wisdom of the rule hath in the end appeared from the inconveniences that have followed the innovation19          In short like Holmes and like the constrained vision in general Blackstone found evolved systemic rationality superior to explicitly excogitated individual rationality Blackstone thus became the great expositor and advocate of the British common lawdoctrines that are not set down in any written statute or ordinance but depend merely upon immemorial usage20 Moreover in interpreting the written law Blackstone urged following the original intentions of those who wrote the law seeking to interpret the will of the legislator by exploring his intentions at the time when the law was made taking his words in their usual and most known signification establishing their meaning from the context if necessary and only as a last resort when the words are dubious trying to carry out the intent or spirit of the law21    Like Holmes later in the law or like his contemporary Burke in politics Blackstone did not advocate an unchanging law or society What distinguished his position was the mode of change and the caution about change  The doctrine of the law then is this that precedents and rules must be followed unless flatly absurd or unjust for though their reason be not obvious at first view yet we owe such deference to former times as not to suppose they acted wholly without consideration22            Though Blackstone and Holmes were the most famous exponents of the constrained vision in the laws of their respective countries their views were not unique not confined to legal theorists Other exponents of the constrained vision in other fields expressed similar views when they mentioned the law To Burke for example jurisprudence with all its defects redundancies and errors is the collected reason of the ages23 To Hayek the law does not owe its structure to the design of either judges or legislators24 Adam Smith saw the sacred and necessary law of retaliation for murder as antecedent to all reflections upon the utility of punishment25 and natural resentment in general as the safeguard of justice and the security of innocence26 With all law evolved as an expression of the natural feelings and experiences of human beings in general not the articulated rationality of intellectual or moral leaders Moreover human nature was not considered to vary fundamentally over time Holmes assumed that the earliest barbarian    had a good many of the same feelings and passions as ourselves27 Here too his assumptions were typical of the kind of equality conceived by the constrained vision      The Unconstrained Vision     The unconstrained vision has likewise been consistent over the centuries in reaching opposite conclusions on justice and the law Although the argument has been made that modern psychological and sociological thinking enables courts today to individualize punishments to the criminal rather than the crime the argument for individualizing the application of law to the criminal goes back at least as far as the eighteenth century and has been as much a part of the unconstrained vision as the opposite view has been part of the opposite vision    William Godwin condemned both the absurdity and the iniquity of punishment according to the general category of crimes committed No crimes were ever alike he said28 According to Godwin  There is no maxim more clear than this Every case is a rule to itself No action of any man was ever the same as any other action had ever the same degree of utility or injury It should seem to be the business of justice to distinguish the qualities of men and not which has hitherto been the practice to confound them29          It is not real justice according to Godwin to proceed by reducing all men to the same stature according to the crime committed Rather justice requires contemplation of all the circumstances of each individual case30 Note however that the opposite positions of Godwin and Holmes on individualized punishment do not reflect differences in value premises Holmes like Godwin regarded it as morally superior to individualize criminal punishments or civil liability judgments but simply regarded this    higher morality as beyond the capability of human courts They differed in empirical assumptions rather than in value premises    The emphasis on individualizing criminal justice has remained part of the unconstrained vision over the centuries John Dewey for example said  The dawn of truly scientific criminal law will come when each individual case is approached with something corresponding to the complete clinical record which every competent physician attempts to procure as a matter of course in dealing with his subject31          In the unconstrained vision it is not only the justice of punishment but also its efficacy which is at issue According to Godwin punishment is inimical to the improvement of the mind because incentives of reward and punishment are distractions from the real reasons why one kind of behavior is socially preferable to another32 In Godwins view moral improvement will be forwarded in proportion as we are exposed to no other influence than that of the tendency which belongs to an action by the necessary and unalterable laws of existence Man needs to be governed by the moral arithmetic of the case realizing that the wellbeing of many others is more important than his own33    While the constrained vision takes peoples motives and predispositions as given and emphasizes incentives to lead to socially desired behavior the unconstrained vision attempts to change peoples motives and predispositions so that incentives in general are less important whether in the economic marketplace or in the law34 The unconstrained vision seeks a solutionin Condorcets words the reconciliation the identification of the interests of each with the interests of all so that the path of virtue is no longer arduous35      From the standpoint of the unconstrained vision the issue is not how best to structure incentives currently but how to rely less and less on incentives over timeespecially the incentive of punishment Social institutions should aim at seeing men influenced by other and better motives The statesman should be careful not to add rigor to the selfish passions but instead to gradually wean men from contemplating their own benefit as incentives in general tend to cause them to do36 Godwin wished to see men more concerned with their duties and rights than with rewards and punishments37    Just as the two visions see the nature and role of rewards and punishments very differently so they see the development of law in quite different terms For Condorcet progress in the law was conceived as the deliberate work of outstanding individuals  Laws are better formulated and appear less often to be the vague product of circumstances and caprice they are made by learned men if not yet by philosophers38          Further advancement was conceived by Condorcet in similarly rationalistic terms  The creation of a system of criminal jurisprudence would be a huge enterprise demanding time work and a luminous intelligence in those undertaking it and a profound mind in the man charged with responsibility for planning and executing it39          The unconstrained vision has continued to emphasize the deliberate creation of law by both legislators and judges in order to produce desired social results It rejects the emphasis of the constrained vision on the characteristics desirable in legal processes as such and especially the    attempt to make the judges role essentially that of a neutral transmitter of process principles created by constitutional or legislative enactments Where process principles have disparate impact on different social groups the neutrality of the principle and the judge are deemed illusory if not hypocritical    The emphasis on process has been called by Laurence Tribe the dangerous allure of proceduralism The attempt to evolve principles aimed at the general benefit of society without regard to their differential impact on subsets within society he characterized as the paralyzing seduction of neutrality and the vision of an incrementally evolving law he described as the morally anesthetizing imagery of the natural It was the social result that was crucial the hidden and sometimes notsohidden tilt of various constitutional doctrines toward the perpetuation of unjust hierarchies of race gender and class which he found offensive and the attempt to deflect judicial responsibility for crucial substantive choices which he found questionable40    Tribes viewpoint questions all formulas as devices for concealing the constitutional choices that we must makeand that we cannot responsibly pretend to derive by any neutral technique41 In short the issue is not process principles but social results not transmission of law derived from incremental evolution in the past but deliberate choices made in the present Tribe denies that this means anything goes in judicial interpretation42 but argues that interpretation of texts is inescapably subjective so that the interpreter has no escape from the need to make commitments of significant premises of social morality43    We must make choices but renounce the equally illusory freedom to choose however we might wish to choose For it is a Constitutiona specific necessarily imperfect Constitutionin whose terms we are after all choosing44         Judges thus must get into the kind of controversial substantive choices that the process proponents are so anxious to leave to the electorate and its representatives45 To Tribe the Constitution is inevitably substantive46 so that those who interpret it must decide issues taking substantive results into account In short to Tribe the written law is neither irrelevant nor all determining The Constitution is not simply a mirror nor is it an empty vessel whose users may pour into it whatever they will47    As an example of the difference between processbased judicial decisions and a more substantively based decision Tribe criticized court rulings which upheld the legality of applying certain physical standards to particular job applicants regardless of sex blithely ignoring sexspecific physical differences that make the similar treatment of men and woman invidious discrimination48 A number of sexdifference cases demonstrate to Tribe that pervasive inequalities in the distribution of power and status are overlooked that the evils to be extirpated are instead allowed to flourish as part of the omnipresent realities that the legal order simultaneously reflects and recreates with relentless rationality49    In a similar vein Ronald Dworkin called for a fusion of constitutional law and moral theory The Constitution itself rests on a particular moral theory and must be understood as appealing to moral concepts rather than laying down particular conceptionsthat is it is to be interpreted broadly as moral values to be applied rather than as explicit rules to follow Any court that undertakes the burden of applying constitutional clauses must be an activist court in the sense that it must be prepared to frame and answer questions of political morality50      INDIVIDUAL RIGHTS     Both visions believe in rights But rights as conceived in the unconstrained vision are virtually a negation of rights as conceived in the constrained vision Social theorists in both traditions recognize that rights are not absolute and there are variations within both visions as to the weights given one right over another when they conflict as well as differences in the scope accorded a particular right But the fundamental difference between the two visions is in what the very concept of rights means      The Constrained Vision     As already noted in Chapter 7 the constrained vision thinks of legal boundaries within which private individuals and groups may make their own decisions without being secondguessed by political or legal authorities as to whether those decisions are wise or foolish noble or mean From the standpoint of the constrained vision the scope of those boundaries of immunity from public authority are the scope of peoples rights This is a process conception of rightsthe legal ability of people to carry on certain processes without regard to the desirability of the particular results as judged by others    Although these rights as zones of immunity from public authority belong to individuals their whole purpose is social in the constrained vision In that vision the sacrifice of the individual for the social good has a long tradition going back at least as far as Adam Smith in philosophy and economics and Holmes and Blackstone in American and British law respectively Yet it is precisely this tradition which has consistently emphasized the importance of individual property rights for example The crucial benefits of property rights have been conceived as socialas permitting an economic process with greater efficiency51 a social process with less strife52 and a political process with more diffused power and influence than that possible under centralized political control of the economy53 The beneficiaries of such processes are conceived to be the population at large and the justification or lack of justification of property rights is made to rest on that basis    In the same way rights of free speech are zones of immunity from public authority without regard to whether what is said is wise or foolish noble or mean In two of Holmes bestknown free speech opinions on the Supreme    Court he rested his conclusion in favor of free speech on social expediency not the superior rights of the individual In Abrams v United States Holmes pointed out that this social expediency derived from the inherent limitations of mans knowledge and the crucial tradeoff this implied Persecution for the expression of opinions would be perfectly logical he said provided you have no doubt of your premises Holmes continued  But when men have realized that time has upset many fighting faiths they may come to believe even more than they believe the very foundation of their own conduct that the ultimate good desired is better reached by free trade in ideasthat the best test of truth is the power of the thought to get itself accepted in the competition of the market and that truth is the only ground upon which their wishes safely can be carried out That at any rate is the theory of our Constitution It is an experiment as all life is an experiment Every year if not every day we have to wager our salvation upon some prophecy based upon imperfect knowledge54          This opinion encapsulated key features of the constrained vision 1 the test of truth by social process rather than articulated rationality 2 inherent human limitationsmans imperfect knowledgeas the reason for relying on social processes and 3 reliance on experience as the overall rationale time has upset many fighting faiths    The primacy of social interests over those of the individual appeared both in this opinion and later in Schenck v United States In Abrams while Holmes urged eternal vigilance against the suppression of opinions considered loathsome and dangerous his proviso was unless they so imminently threaten immediate interference with the lawful and pressing purposes of the law that an immediate check is necessary to save the country55 This was a clear forerunner of his more famous proviso of a clear and present danger standard in Schenck In both cases the public interest was considered paramount with free speech being a derivative right of the individual precisely in order to serve that public interestand    therefore subject always to annulment when it directly and unmistakably threatened the public interest itself Finally the right of free speech whatever its scope or limitations meant purely and simply an exemption from public authority It did not imply any facilitating activity by the authorities      The Unconstrained Vision     Unlike the constrained vision which sees individual rights as instrumentalities of the social processtheir scope and limits justified by the social processes from which they are derivedthe unconstrained vision sees rights as inhering in individuals for their own individual benefit and as fundamental recognitions of their humanity Freespeech rights or property rights are therefore justified or not by their relative importance to the individuals who exercise them Given the uneven distribution of property and the universality of speech freedom of speech logically becomes a far more important right than property rights in this vision Freespeech rights are thus entitled to sweeping exemptions from interventions of public authority but not so property rights Dworkin dismissed the silly proposition that true liberals must respect economic as well as intellectual liberty    56    Issues involving property rights are seen in a results context in the unconstrained vision of Dworkin and Tribe rather than a process context While those with a constrained vision focus on the incentive effects of a propertyrights system on the economic process those with the unconstrained vision focus on such social results as the existing distribution of property Laws safeguarding property rights are thus viewed in the unconstrained vision of Laurence Tribe as immunizing from majoritarian rearrangement extant distributions of wealth and economic power almost as though such patterns and distributions of capital reflected something decreed and indeed sanctified by nature rather than something chosen by the polity57 Propertyrights issues are to Tribe issues concerning the existing distribution of capital58 Doctrines espousing property rights represent a tilt against redistribution59 The rights of property and contract supported by the framers of the US Constitution represent    substantive values Therefore Tribe finds it puzzling that anyone can say in the face of this reality that the Constitution is or should be predominantly concerned with process and not substance60 According to Tribe seemingly neutral principles in theory turn out in practice to tilt decidedly in the direction of existing concentrations of wealth and influence61    Freespeech rights have likewise been viewed by Tribe in a substantive results context  The decline of traditional public forums such as parks and streets has been accompanied by the rise of privately owned shopping centers as key locations for reaching the public inexpensive methods of communication such as leafletting picketing and soapbox orating have given way to expensive media such as electronic broadcasting newspaper advertising and direct mail62          In short speech as it now comes to us is usually anything but free63 according to Tribe and free expression has not in truth been available to all64 This conception of free speech like the conception of freedom in general in the unconstrained vision is clearly a results conception unlike Holmes process conception in which all that was at issue was exemption from limitation by governmental authority This cost conception of free speech has not been limited to Laurence Tribe or other legal theorists The US Supreme Court in a series of cases involving the handing out of leaflets on private property housing developments shopping malls in violation of the owners prohibitions ruled in favor of those handing out the leaflets citing the expensiveness of alternative modes of exercising free speech rights as a reason for overriding property rights65 Had the court not sided with those arrested under trespass laws according to Tribe it would have meant that local property laws would have denied the protection of the First Amendment to the residents of company towns and those who wished to communicate with them66 There would have been a denial of    free speech by this conception even though the content of what was said at some other locationwould have remained exempt from government authority      SOCIAL JUSTICE     William Godwins Enquiry Concerning Political Justice in 1793 may have been the first treatise on social justice The term political in its title was used in the sense common at the time referring to organized societymuch as the contemporary expression political economy referred to the economics of society as distinguished from the economics of the household In short Godwin wrote on social justice as that term is used today Social justice as depicted by Godwin was a pervasive and demanding duty He said our debt to our fellow men includes all the efforts we could make for their welfare and all the relief we could supply to their necessities According to Godwin Not a talent do we possess not a moment of time not a shilling of property for which we are not responsible at the tribunal of the public which we are not obliged to pay into the general bank of common advantage67 He rejected the supposition that we have a right as it has been phrased to do what we will with our own He denied its premise We have in reality nothing that is strictly speaking our own68    However these were all moral duties not political duties such as might be imposed by a welfare state or a socialist government It was the imperative moral force of such heavy social duties which made it unnecessary for Godwin or Condorcet to invoke governmental power to effect the kind of social changes today identified with the stateand for both to support property rights and laissezfaire69 as far as governments role was concerned It is not difficult however to see how the kind of social analysis pursued by Godwin and Condorcet has led others to oppose laissezfaire economics and to have reservations about property rights if not outright opposition to the concept It was their faith in the power of    reason to eventually make moral duties effective guides to individual conduct which made it unnecessary for Godwin or Condorcet to resort to government as the instrument of the sweeping social changes they sought This also illustrates the pitfalls of mechanically translating unconstrained and constrained visions into the political left and right since Godwin and Condorcet were more radical than many on the left who would not share their reluctance to touch property rights or invoke government planning    Whatever its mechanisms or details social justice has been the dominant theme of the unconstrained vision from Godwin to Rawls Like other forms of justice it is conceived as a result rather than a process But while the imperative of social justice pervades the unconstrained vision it is virtually nonexistent in the constrained vision Social thinkers in the tradition of the constrained vision deal with issues of income distribution as a process and consider its humane aspects as well as efficiency issues but there is no implication that one income distribution result is more just than another F A Hayek is one of the few writers with a constrained vision who discusses social justice at alland he characterizes it as absurd70 a mirage71 a hollow incantation72 a quasireligious superstition73 and a concept that does not belong to the category of error but to that of nonsense74 Other contemporaries of his in the tradition of the constrained visionMilton Friedman and Richard Posner for exampledo not bother to discuss it even as something to be rebutted    The concept of social justice thus represents the extremes of the conflict of visionsan idea of the highest importance in one vision and beneath contempt in the other      The Unconstrained Vision     Humane efforts to help the less fortunate have been part of both visions over the centuries Adam Smith took part in such efforts both in theory and in practice75 So did John Stuart Mill76 The campaign against slavery was also supported by leading figures in both traditionsby Burke and Smith as well as by Godwin and Condorcet77 In the twentieth century schemes of income transfer to the poor have been proposed by Milton Friedman and by George Bernard Shaw78    What distinguishes the unconstrained vision is not that it prescribes humane concern for the poor but that it sees transfers of material benefits to the less fortunate not simply as a matter of humanity but as a matter of justice Edward Bellamys novel Looking Backward protested not only that the poor were relegated to receiving crusts but that insult was added to injury by calling the crusts charity As coinheritors of a prosperity created largely through the efforts of preceding generations they were entitled to morein the name of justice    Central to the concept of social justice is the notion that individuals are entitled to some share of the wealth produced by a society simply by virtue of being members of that society and irrespective of any individual contributions made or not made to the production of that wealth Whether they are entitled to a full share or a smaller shareperhaps only some minimum of decencyis a question answered variously by different social thinkers in this tradition but the crucial point is that everyone is seen as entitled to some share as a matter of justice not simply as a matter of charity According to Godwin    The doctrine of the injustice of accumulated property has been the foundation of all religious morality Its most energetic teachers have been irresistibly led to assert the precise truth in this respect They have taught the rich that they hold their wealth only as a trust that they are strictly accountable for every atom of their expenditure that they are merely administrators and by no means proprietors in chief But while religion thus inculcated on mankind the pure principles of justice the majority of its professors have been but too apt to treat the practice of justice not as a debt which it ought to be considered but as an affair of spontaneous generosity and bounty     The effect which is produced by this accommodating doctrine is to place the supply of our wants in the disposal of a few enabling them to make a show of generosity with what is not truly their own and to purchase the submission of the poor by the payment of a debt Theirs is a system of clemency and charity instead of a system of justice It fills the rich with unreasonable pride by the spurious denominations with which it decorates their acts and the poor with servility by leading them to regard the slender comforts they obtain not as their incontrovertible due but as the good pleasure and grace of their opulent neighbors79          Similar themes have remained part of the tradition of the unconstrained vision George Bernard Shaw disdained people who plunge into almsgiving to relieve their sickly consciences partly because it fills the paupers with humiliation the patrons with evil pride and both with hatred but more fundamentally because in a country justly and providently managed there could be neither excuse for it on the paupers part nor occasion for it on the patrons80    While the concept of social justice in the unconstrained vision revolves around issues of income distributionconceived as a statistical result there is also a subsidiary concern for social mobility also conceived as a    result All of these concerns are viewed in radically different terms in the constrained vision      The Constrained Vision     Although F A Hayek is exceptional among leading figures in the constrained vision in discussing social justice at all the nature of his discussion may provide clues as to why so many others in this tradition do not bother to discuss it While those with the unconstrained vision define social justice as a result which they warmly embrace Hayek treats social justice as a process which he bitterly rejectsthe atrocious principle implied that all rewards should be determined by political power81 Hayek neither challenges accepts nor denies the results characterized by others as social justice His objection is not that some alternative pattern of income results is preferable but rather that the attempt to create such preconceived results means creating processes which can destroy a civilization82    Hayeks whole method of thinking is directly the opposite to that of Rawls When Rawls repeatedly speaks of reasons of justice why society should arrangesomehowone result rather than another he abstracts from social processes to concentrate on social goals But Hayek abstracts from these social justice goals to concentrate on the characteristics of the processes created in pursuit of these goalsand the dangers that such processes are deemed to represent to freedom and general wellbeing In short each has assumed away the primary concern of the otherprimary not simply as to whether freedom or justice is more important but as to whether process characteristics or goal characteristics are more important    Hayek treats much of the rhetoric of social justice as a confused evasion of harsh realities inherent in the processes required to move toward such goals To Hayek those things commonly modified by the adjective socialjustice conscience democracyare by their very nature inherently social so that this adjective is meaningless by reason of    redundancy if the word is used in an honest and straightforward way It is incredibly empty of meaning according to Hayek83 so that to employ it was either thoughtless or fraudulent84    Although Hayek found the concept of social justice to be devoid of specific meaning he found it fraught with insinuations which he considered both erroneous and dangerous Many who habitually employ the phrase do not know themselves what they mean by it85 he said but others who have used it were not simply engaging in sloppy thinking but intellectual dishonesty86 According to Hayek the phrase social justice is not as most people probably feel an innocent expression of good will towards the less fortunate but has become in practice a dishonest insinuation that one ought to agree to a demand of some special interest which can give no real reason for it87 The dangerous aspect in Hayeks view is that the concept of social justice has been the Trojan Horse through which totalitarianism has entered88Nazi Germany being just one example89    At the social policy level Hayek objected to the very notion of the actions of society or the treatment of individuals and groups by society as anthropomorphism or personification incompatible with the concept of systemic social processes90 To demand justice from such a process is clearly absurd according to Hayek for the particulars of a spontaneous order cannot be just or unjust91 because the results are not intended or foreseen and depend on a multitude of circumstances not known in their totality to anybody92 The hiddenand dangeroussignificance of the demand for social justice in Hayeks view was that it implied a drastic change in whole processes under the bland guise of a mere preference for better distribution According to Hayek society in the strict sense in which it must be distinguished from the apparatus of government is incapable of acting for a specific purpose so that the demand for social justice becomes a demand that the members of society should organize themselves in a manner which makes it possible to assign particular shares of the product of society to the different individuals or groups93      In short those who argue for social justice argue for a particular set of results while Hayeks objections are to the process implied by seeking these or any other specific social results for particular individuals or groups What he objected to was a desire for a comprehensive blueprint of the social scene as a whole94 For him personification of society as a thinking collective entity capable of producing specifically desired social results presupposed a mastery of social details inherently beyond our ken95    It was not merely the futility of the attempt but the dangerousness of the attempt that was central to Hayeks objections In his view human freedom was crucially dependent on rules in general and especially on rules which carved out domains of exemption from government power These rights as conceived in the constrained visionprotect ascertainable domains within which each individual is free to act as he chooses96 and are thus the very opposite of rights to social justice which imply expansion of the governmental domain to produce social results to which particular individuals and groups are morally entitled Whether they are or are not morally entitleda subject dealt with at great length by various writers in the tradition of the unconstrained visionis a subject totally ignored in Hayeks various writings on social justice This is logically consistent with his view of the futility of the attempt and its dangerousness It may also explain why other writers with a constrained vision do not discuss the general concept of social justice at all though they deal with such specifics as income distribution or the social responsibility of business97 orin the case of Richard Posnerwrite a whole treatise on justice98 Given the assumptions of the unconstrained vision social justice is at the heart of all discussions of policy or societies Given the assumptions of the constrained vision it is hardly worth talking about just as square circles are not worth talking about however great the desirability of such things might be if they were possible    The greatest danger of the concept of social justice according to Hayek is that it undermines and ultimately destroys the concept of a rule of law in order to supersede merely formal justice as a process governed by rules    with real or social justice as a set of results to be produced by expanding the power of government to make discretionary determinations in domains once exempt from its power While Hayek regarded some advocates of social justice as cynically aware that they were really engaged in a concentration of power the greater danger he saw in those sincerely promoting the concept with a zeal which unconsciously prepares the way for otherstotalitariansto step in after the undermining of ideological political and legal barriers to government power makes their task easier Thus he regarded Nazism as the culmination of a long evolution of thought99 in Germany by socialists and others whose goals were vastly different from those of the Nazis but who promoted the erosion of respect for legal rules in favor of the imperatives of specific social results100    Communism has likewise been seen by Hayek as a residual beneficiary of the way of thinking promoted by people who may have no desire to see communism triumph According to Hayek distributive justice is inherently irreconcilable with the rule of law101 and the ideal of a government of laws and not of men is all that stands between a free society and totalitarianism He quotes a Soviet writer who declared that communism means not the victory of socialist law but the victory of socialism over any law102 To Hayek that is what social justice as an overriding goal ultimately means as an alternative to merely formal justice as impersonal rules of a process      SUMMARY AND IMPLICATIONS       The Unconstrained Vision     In the unconstrained vision where man is capable of foreseeing and controlling the social consequences of his decisions both the individual and society are causally and morally responsible for having made choices whose social results are what they are The nature of socially just results is therefore a central concern of this vision which has produced a number of treatises on the principles of social justice from William Godwins Enquiry Concerning Political Justice in the eighteenth century to John Rawls Theory of Justice in the twentieth This vision demands for the less fortunate not merely charity but justice It demands of its laws not merely procedural rules but just resultswith the former yielding to the latter in case of conflict    Judges are not to limit themselves to the application of procedural rules in disregard of the resulting justice or injustice according to the unconstrained vision but are to apply moral standards implicit in the law which rules are essentially attempts to suggest Judges cannot pretend to themselves or others that they are only applying prescribed procedural rules when in fact particular legal rules produce particular social results so that social choices have been made implicitly by judges whether they acknowledge them or not Those with the unconstrained vision want these choices made explicitly based on constitutional values and norms rather than on narrow readings of constitutional rules on the one hand or purely ad hoc judicial preferences on the other    In this vision the rights of individuals are to be taken seriously as essential recognitions of their humanity and social expediency is to yield when basic human rights such as free speech or the right of the accused to constitutional protection are at issue103 In conflicts between rights those    which define the human being as a subject rather than an object are to have categorical preference over other rights such as rights to property and all rights are to trump all interests such as a general interest in social peace or economic efficiency Inconveniences caused by pickets or those handing out leaflets are deemed a small price to pay for the basic right to free speech and the fact that some criminals escape the law due to constitutional protections essential to the recognition of the basic humanity of all is likewise a price worth paying to those with the unconstrained vision    Given the greater ability of individuals and social decisionmakers to foresee the consequences of their actions in the unconstrained vision there is a correspondingly greater moral burden on them to exhibit social responsibility rather than simply to pursue their own individual interests within procedural rules In William Godwins vision especially each individual thus becomes in effect a surrogate decisionmaker for society even when making purely individual and unofficial decisionsa surrogate not in the sense of controlling others decisions but in the sense of making his own available choices in such a way as to promote the general well being rather than his own Thus the radical individualism of Godwin which is procedurally the same as that of modern libertarianism in its sweeping rejection of a government role in the economy is substantively much closer to modern socialism in wanting specific social results to be the direct object of the decisionmaking process    Equality has been at the heart of the tradition of the unconstrained vision in its conception of justice as elsewhere Degrees and modifications of equality have varied among those in this tradition but in whatever degree or modification equality has meant equality of results Given mans ability to shape social results this has included compensatory rather than equal treatment of some While the modern form of this approach in affirmative action policies is quite recent the idea of compensatory social treatment goes back at least as far as Condorcet in the eighteenth century104    In addition to being logically consistent with the unconstrained vision affirmative action also illustrates the role of rights and interests in that    vision Members of the general population are deemed to have an interest in particular jobs college admission and other benefits to which compensatory preferences for selected groups may apply But the members of those selected groups have a right to be where they would have been except for historical patterns of discrimination Interests therefore give way to rights which are trumps Individuals from either the majority population or selected minorities have equal interests and suffer equal losses of those interests when denied a job college admission or other benefits But members of the selected minority groups are also deemed to have suffered past stigmatizing implications of inferiority through discrimination which current rejected applicants from the majority population do not suffer in reverse discrimination Since stigmas of inferiority are seen as denials of basic humanity they violate rights as rights are conceived in the unconstrained vision while reverse discrimination can violate only interests Once again in this vision rights take precedence over interests    Moral rights in the unconstrained vision are rights to results Their political and judicial enforcement justify the extension of government power to domains of interest such as those protected by property rights Those other interests are not annihilated but are abridged to the extent made necessary to vindicate more fundamental rights and constitutionally protected values This process involves judges weighing competing values making complex constitutional choices in Laurence Tribes phrase rather than simply applying procedural rules      The Constrained Vision     Much of what the unconstrained vision sees as morally imperative to do the constrained vision sees man as incapable of doing Because of the crucial premise that man cannot effectively monitor the social ramifications and reverberations of his individual choiceswhether he acts for himself or in the name of societythe constrained vision treats as moot vast ranges of moral principles encompassed under the heading of social justice There are no constitutional choices to make if man cannot choose social results anyway Even when the individuals decision has major social impact it will seldom be the result he intended given the assumption of the constrained vision that deliberately determining social results rationalistically is beyond the capabilities of man A central concern of those with the constrained vision is precisely that there will be major social impacts of a kind completely different from the intentions including the destruction of the rule of law in the quest for an illusory social justice    In the constrained vision the principles of justice are subordinated to the possibilities of justice Oliver Wendell Holmes acknowledged that taking account of the inborn clumsiness of an individual who innocently inflicted damage on others would be a higher form of justice but dismissed it as a principle of civil litigation beyond human capability The whole literature on social justice issuing from those with an unconstrained vision is almost totally ignored by those with the constrained vision Particular issues are covered in both visions but the general principles of modern social justice theory are neither contested nor evaluated by the leading contemporaries in the constrained vision Even Hayek who has paid more attention to this literature than others of his persuasion spends virtually no time on its general principles being concerned instead with determining the likely social consequences of attempting to pursue such goalstheir actual realization being implicitly deemed impossible       Social processes are central to the constrained vision Individual rights originate take their meaning and find their limits in the needs of social processes However that does not mean that incumbent judges or political leaders are authorized to expand or contract these rights in ad hoc fashion according to their changing assessments of social needs On the contrary these rights are domains of exemption from the judgments of political or legal authorities The assessment of longrun social expediency is already implicit in that exemption This is symptomatic of a more general difference between the constrained and the unconstrained visions They differ not only in the locus of discretion and the mode of discretion but also in the locus of assessment and the mode of assessment    In the constrained vision man is capable of making longrun and general assessments of social processes comparing constitutional government with alternative governments or competitive economies with politically directed economies for example The mode of assessment is experiential and the revealed preference of the manyespecially when they vote with their feetis from this perspective more persuasive than the articulation of the few By contrast the unconstrained vision implicitly sees man as capable of judging more immediately and more minutely when it offers discrete solutions to numerous social problems seriatim    While those with the unconstrained vision often stress the complexity of the social choices to be weighed by judges and other surrogate decision makers those with the constrained vision see such complexity as too great even to attempt to prescribe specific social results leaving surrogate decisionmakers with the more manageable task of applying rules which allow the substantive tradeoffs to be made at the discretion of innumerable other individuals    With ordinary social results so difficult to control in the world as conceived in the constrained vision compensatory justice is beyond consideration The moral rationales of such policies as affirmative action    receive little or no attention given the remoteness of any possibility of their being realized What is examined instead are the incentives created by such policies and their effect on social processes especially the rule of law as contrasted with the issuance of edicts prescribing results The argument concerning stigma was rejected in the Bakke case not on grounds that it was not true but on grounds that it was not part of the constitutional rules which the Supreme Court was authorized to apply105    In the constrained vision with justice as with everything else the best is the enemy of the good      Chapter 9    Visions Values and Paradigms    Visions differ both morally and intellectually Moreover social visions differ in some respectsthough not allfrom visions which play an important role in science A central question from a moral perspective is the extent to which different social visions reflect differences in value premises A central concern from an intellectual perspective is the very different history of visions of society and visions underlying scientific theories of natural phenomena It is also useful to understand whether social issues represent conflicts of values of visions or of interests      PARADIGMS AND EVIDENCE     While visions involve assumed facts and assumed causes a vision is not a paradigm in Thomas Kuhns sense of a theoretical model of causation1 A vision is an almost instinctive sense of what things are and how they work Kuhns paradigm is a much more intellectually developed entity including scientific law theory application and instrumentation together2 Visions may lead to paradigms whether in science or in politics economics law or other fields but visions and paradigms are different stages in the intellectual process Whether in science or in social thought visions or inspirations come first and are subsequently systematized into paradigms which embrace specific theories and their narrowly focused hypotheses which can be tested against evidence    In these general intellectual terms visions of scientific phenomena and visions of society proceed in parallel ways However opposing paradigms in science do not persist for centuries as paradigms derived from the constrained and unconstrained visions have in politics economics law and social thought in general The phlogiston theory and the oxidation theory did not coexist and endure together in chemistry Scientific paradigms tend to succeed each other in history not coexist through centuries While still in the early states of the development of science men confronting the same particular phenomena might describe and interpret them in different ways But these divergences according to Kuhn disappear to a very considerable extent and then apparently once and for all3 No such process has yet become general in social thought    The fundamental difference between science and social theory is not at the level of visions or even paradigms but at the point where theories    produce empirically testable hypotheses The uncontrollable variations which prevent laboratory experiments with societies prevent the decisive confrontations which shatter particular hypotheses reverberating backward to shake theories and perhaps even topple paradigms and the visions they embody Moreover the biological continuity of the human race means that experiments which fail cannot be begun over again from scratch as a chemist throws out a batch of chemicals from a failed experiment and tries again with a fresh batch of chemicals We can never know what Germany would be like today if there had been no Hitler or how Western civilization would have developed had there been no decline and fall of the Roman Empire In short evidence is not as decisive in social visions This is due not only to the nature of the evidence but also to the strength of commitments to social values    Although opposing views begin with visions they do not end there Visions are only the raw material from which theories are constructed and specific hypotheses deduced In principle the opposing conclusions reached can be checked against evidence and the conflict of visions resolved There are a number of reasons why this does not happen on such a scale as to produce a decisive victory for one social vision over others though individuals may find particular evidence sufficient to change their thinking    Definitive evidence cannot be expected on the grand general sweep of a vision A great deal of partial evidence may be accumulated on each side but the evidence for and against ones own vision can be weighed differently and being convinced is ultimately a subjective process Even in those cases where a clear confrontation in empirical terms can be arranged and evidence produced every lost battle on one front does not signal the end of the war much less unconditional surrender When hypotheses deriving from a particular vision are contradicted by evidence in the form in which they were first asserted they may nevertheless be salvageable in a less extreme or more complex form    Evidence is not irrelevant however Road to Damascus conversions do occur Even if this conversion is only on a single issue the repercussions on    ones general vision may lead to a domino effect on other assumptions and beliefs Responses to evidenceincluding denial evasion and obfuscation likewise testify to the threat that it represents At one extreme in the relationship of evidence to visions is the total subordination of evidence to conclusions based on a vision or the theories deriving from it Those Western intellectuals who for years ignored evaded denied or explained away the growing evidence of Stalins mass murders and slave labor camps are a classic example of this phenomenon    Similar cases can be found for both constrained and unconstrained visions While evidence on particular issues may be falsified this phenomenon is itself true and weighty evidence for the power of visions In many cases there are no personal economic political or career gains to be made by the individual that would explain the falsification It is done simply for the sake of the vision    Evidence need not be falsified in order to be evaded The very formulation of a theory may be such as to insulate it from direct confrontation with contrary evidence In other words the theory may be so stated that nothing could possibly happen that would prove it wrong In this case the theory is reduced to empirical meaninglessness since all possible outcomes are consistent with it it predicts nothing Yet though it specifically predicts no single concrete outcome it may insinuate much and be enormously effective in its insinuation Malthus theory of population is a classic example of a theory of this sort based ultimately on a constrained vision but in later years adapted by others for use as part of an agenda deriving from an unconstrained vision    The population principle expounded by T R Malthus in 1798 projected a grim picture of a highly constrained world inhabited by highly constrained man It was explicitly set forth in opposition to the ideas of William Godwin and of Condorcet4 whose unconstrained visions of man were anathema to Malthus      Malthus theory began with two postulatesthat 1 food is necessary to the existence of man and that 2 the passion between the sexes is necessary and will remain nearly in its present state These he called laws of our nature5in short constraints unlikely to disappear Implicit also was the law of diminishing returns so that an increase of population would not lead to a proportionate increase in the food supply as more people grew food6 Thus there were differential constraints on the increase of population and on the increase of food It was logically sufficient for his purposes that population could grow faster than food though by calling the former rate of increase geometrical and the latter arithmetical he dramatized the difference in a way that made the idea indelible and historic    Because population is ultimately constrained by the food supply the empirical implication of the original Malthusian theory is that the observed rates of growth of the two must be similar According to Malthus the population constantly bears a regular proportion to the food that the earth is made to produce7 This is the crucial conclusion from Malthus two postulates and it constitutes the empirical test of the truth or falsity of Malthusian theory If in the long run the food supply grows faster than the population then the average nourishment per person rises and the Malthusian theory is false Given two possible outcomes which would respectively confirm or deny the Malthusian theory there would seem to be little room for controversy after sufficient time had passed and sufficient data had been collected    Yet no such clear confrontation of evidence and theory has occurred because of Malthus shifting formulations under stress of critical attack In later years Malthus declared that higher incomes among the masses could lead to either of two very different resultsan increase of population or improvements in the modes of subsistence8 With both possibilities now being considered consistent with the Malthusian principle there was no possible evidence that could conceivably prove it wrongwhether it was in fact right or wrong In reality as census and other data accumulated over the years the food supplyand other elements of the general standard of    livingtended to increase faster than population Yet the Malthusian population theory has survived and flourished    Malthus clearly had a constrained vision To prevent the recurrence of misery is alas beyond the power of man9 he said and he even doubted whether there had ever been a permanent increase in the span of life10 He spoke of laws inherent in the nature of man and absolutely independent of all human regulations11 and declared The vices and moral weakness of mankind taken in the mass are invincible12 However though Malthus theory of population was within the tradition of the constrained vision it was not the only population theory consistent with that vision Adam Smiths theory of population was quite different in analysis and conclusion13 Moreover the Malthusian population principle has re emerged with modifications on the political left among people with an unconstrained vision    In the modified version overpopulation is neither inherent nor invincible but simply cannot be effectively prevented by relying on the discretion of individuals However with political leadership which may range from hortatory to draconian there is a solution through birth control and abortions In short ideas originating in one vision may be adapted to another But for the Malthusian population theory to last long enough for this to happen it first had to survive more than a century of contradictory evidence Its success in doing so suggests that evasions and tautological formulations may protect a theory against evidence as effectively as outright falsification    While falsification is clearly a conscious decision evasion is not necessarily conscious and misperceptions of what constitutes evidence still less so Theories may persist because the difficult task of bringing them to confrontation with evidence has simply not been performed with sufficient skill and care This may be especially so when the person testing the theory has a different vision of his own and reads the opposing vision in his terms rather than in its own terms This happened in a celebrated controversy in    economics which erupted right after World War II between distinguished economists of radically different schools of thoughtand voluminous evidence failed completely to resolve the issue    The traditional economic theory was that artificial imposition of wage rates by government or labor unions higher than those emerging in a competitive labor market would tend to cause employment to be less than it would be otherwise This was a direct corollary of the more general economic principle that more of anything tends to be bought at a lower price than at a higher price In order to test this theory a critic of this view sent questionnaires to hundreds of employers asking how they had acted or would act under various possible conditions involving wage rates Most employers did not indicate in their replies that they would react to wage increases by firing workers The critic regarded this as disproof of the prevailing economic theory14    However the prevailing economic theory was not set forth in terms of what individual employers would say but in terms of what the economy as a whole would do While this survey asked employers for their own chosen mode of adjustment the economic theory being tested dealt with the opposite phenomenonhow a competitive economy imposed modes of adjustments on individuals For example an employer might well react to a wage increase by maintaining employment and trying to pass the cost increase along to consumers in higher prices but if this price increase results in a decline in the sales of his product forcing him then to reduce production and employment the net result is the same as if he had deliberately chosen to fire workers because of the imposed wage increase    The real issue was whether externally imposed wage increases reduce employment not whether this takes the particular form of 1 individual employer decisions to lay off workers 2 the bankruptcy of marginal firms 3 a reduction in the number of new firms entering the industry or 4 a decline in sales and employment as cost increases are passed on to the consumer In short the theory being tested was a systemic theory of market adjustments while the questionnaire asked about individual intentions    among surviving businesses The voluminous evidence collected was irrelevant to the issue    These examples are not meant to prove the already obvious point that mistakes or shortcomings mar the use of evidence Instead they are illustrations of particular ways in which disparate and conflicting visions survive together despite an abundance of factual evidence which might otherwise be expected to shift the balance decisively to one side or another over a long span of timesuch as the centuries during which the constrained and the unconstrained visions have survived and flourished together    In the extreme case evidence may simply be falsified or it may be evaded by verbal expedients which empty the theory of empirical meaning while leaving it full of powerful insinuations Conversely evidence may be made to appear to conflict with a theory merely because the specific terms of the theory are misunderstood by those collecting the evidence But perhaps the most striking demonstration of the power of a vision occurs when no evidence at all is either asked or offered for assertions which are consonant with a prevailing vision    A recent example of this phenomenon has been the oftrepeated assertion that higher rates of broken homes and teenage pregnancy among black Americans are a legacy of slavery Only after decades of widespread repetition of this assertion was a comprehensive factual study done revealing that broken homes and teenage pregnancy were far less common among blacks under slavery and in the generations following emancipation than they are today15 Again the point is not that a particular conclusion was mistaken but that a sweeping and unsupported assertion went unchallenged for many years because it fit a particular vision The ability to sustain assertions without any evidence is another sign of the strength and persistence of visions      The process of moving from a vision as an inchoate sense of causation to a specific set of theories and corollariesa paradigm or intellectual model representing what is believed to happenis both intellectually and psychically difficult The precise definition of terms the careful construction of causal links and the derivation of specific hypotheses unambiguously differentiated from the hypotheses derived from alternative theoriesall this requires not only skill but discipline and dedicated efforts To the extent that one has become emotionally committed to or publicly identified with a particular theory its failure in the face of evidence imposes psychic costs that can be painful In an attempt to reconcile the paradigm with the incoming discordant evidence an initially simple principle may be modified and complicated until it resembles a Rube Goldberg contraption    Ridicule of these ad hoc complications is not refutation Moreover any paradigmbeing a model rather than realitywill necessarily not fit the evidence perfectly The scientific formula for the speed of a falling object ignores the effect of atmospheric resistance but no one considers the law of gravity refuted because actual scientific observations show deviations between the acceleration predicted by the theory and that observed as things fall through the air Nor are people who believe in the law of gravity accused of denying the existence of the atmosphere Rather they do not consider the atmosphere essential to the theory of gravity and omit it as a needless complication except in special cases such as heliumfilled balloons which rise instead of fall    In much the same way believers in an unconstrained vision do not deny that man has any limitations They simply do not treat these limitations as decisive in theories of social phenomena whose causal elements are explained in entirely different terms with the limitations of man playing a peripheral role much like that of the atmosphere in the theory of gravity What distinguishes those with the constrained vision is that the limitations of man are at the heart of their theoriesit plays the role of gravity rather than that of atmospheric resistanceand many of the elements emphasized by those with the unconstrained vision are omitted as incidental atmospheric But both visions must omit things which exist in reality and    which most proponents of these visions would admit exist in reality however much they would disagree as to the prevalence or effect of the omitted factors    Given then that no vision and no paradigm derived from it can fit the facts perfectly efforts to adjust and modify visions to accommodate discordant evidence are not inherently mere selfdeception much less dishonesty toward others But the gray area this provides can shelter rationalizations that do fit these descriptions Moreover resistance to the abandonment of paradigms has marked the history of science as well as the history of social theories There are simply fewer places to hide from scientific evidence Nevertheless a scientific paradigm which encounters discordant evidence is not usually abandoned in favor of nihilistic agnosticism but is instead patched up and complicated until there is another paradigm to replace it    Visions and paradigms exist at many levels Karl Marx and a street corner radical on a soapbox may have shared the same vision but at widely varying levels of sophistication The more sophisticated versions of any vision are in part a tacit concession to discordant evidence which might otherwise be fatal This general need for complexity can itself become obliquely a further protection against clearcut evidence refuting a social theory When no other reply to such evidence is possible because it so clearly contradicts what is asserted it is always possible to dismiss the evidence as simplistic because the issue must be more complex than that In science however a simple explanation is preferred to a more complex explanation with no greater empirical accuracy    While visions can survive and thrive on their own inner logic in defiance of empirical evidence the social dangers of such insulated dogmatism are obvious It is no less arbitrary and dogmatic to declare a priori that the truth lies somewhere in between It may It may not On some highly specific issue it may lie entirely on one sideand on another issue with the other side On still other issues it may in fact lie in between The point here is simply that there is no a priori way to say or to avoid the difficult    task of formulating hypotheses and testing them against evidence Nor is this an exercise in futility Even zealots may be forced to abandon some extreme outposts of a given vision as indefensible under empirical attack while the contracted perimeter of the vision continues to be defended fiercely Intellectual struggles can be wars of attrition as well as wars won or lost in a single battle The visions of science rather than those of social thought seem to lend themselves to single decisive confrontations    The growing complexity of social theories in general reflect in part the growing difficulties of defending them in their purer forms Burgeoning empirical data and even more sophisticated ways of analyzing them may fail to deliver a single fatal blow to either of the great opposing visions which have dominated the past two centuries But some important strategic retreats have been made on both sides Neither vision can confidently maintain the air of incontrovertible truth which some of its eighteenth century exponents exhibited It is an advancement even to admit that we are dealing with a conflict of visions      VISIONS AND VALUES     Both constrained and unconstrained visions are fundamentally and essentially visions of causation Only derivatively do they involve clashes of moral principles or different hierarchies of social values The much vaunted need to make our value premises explicit is irrelevant in this contest Thinkers with identical moral values and social preferences must nevertheless reach opposing conclusions if their initial senses of reality and causationtheir visionsare different    Identical twins bred to revere the same moral qualities in the same order must differ in their conclusions if somewhere along the way one conceives of human attributes and social causation as described in the constrained vision and the other conceives them as described in the unconstrained vision Just as travelers seeking the same destination must head in opposite directions if one believes it to be to the east and the other believes it to be to the west so those seeking the greatest good for the greatest number or any other similarly general moral precept must favor opposite kinds of societies if opposite kinds of human beings are assumed to inhabit those societies leading to opposite kinds of social causation Things must work first before they can work to any given end and what will work depends on the nature of the entities involved and their causal connections    In this sense physical science and the analysis of social phenomena both begin with visions It is the ability of the physical sciences to winnow out conflicting visions by systematic experiment which marks a major difference between the intellectual patterns in the two areas However the ability of science to resolve its conflicts of visions does not mean that scientists share the same value premises but rather that value premises    are neither necessary nor sufficient to explain conflicts of visions or their resolution    People with the same moral values readily reach differing political conclusions Convinced religious believers can split into opposite camps on social and political issues if they see worldly or Divine causation in different terms So too do philosophic materialists such as Hobbes and Holbach or believers in a variety of other creeds Where a particular creed implies a particular set of social economic and political conclusionsas in Marxism for exampleit is because that creed contains a particular vision of causation not simply a particular moral premise    Labeling beliefs value premises can readily become one more means by which conclusions insulate themselves from confrontation with evidence or logic To say that a preference for free speech rights over property rights is simply a value premise is to deny that it rests on particular beliefs as to facts or causation and to make it simply an opaque preference like that for plums over tangerines But if in fact the preference for free speech over property rights results from assumptions as to the magnitude of their respective benefits to society at large and the extent to which the less fortunate members of society are helped or made more vulnerable by the two kinds of rights then it is not simply an opaque value premise    With exactly the same preferences for helping the many rather than the few and for protecting the vulnerable more so than those able to protect themselves one would annihilate the preference for free speech over property rights if ones vision of social causation made property rights extremely beneficial to people who own no property as in Hayeks vision for example16 It is precisely the correctness or incorrectness of particular beliefs about social causation that requires scrutinya scrutiny arbitrarily barred by the phrase value premises Value premises are ironically a sort of property right in conclusions not to be trespassed on by evidence or logic      The persistence of opposing visions in the same society contrasts with major changes of visions that occur in individuals The large numbers of people including leading intellectuals who have both embraced Marxism and then repudiated Marxism are a striking example So too are those who embrace or relinquish various religious or secular creeds These suggest that while the psychic costs of changing visions may be high they are not prohibitiveespecially if the changes are gradual rather than road to Damascus conversions    If conversions to and from Marxism turned on differing moral valuations given to the same factual perceptions of the consequences of capitalism and communism it would be difficult to explain why so many conversions occurred in one direction during the Great Depression of the 1930s and in the opposite direction after the NaziSoviet pact in 1939 or the Hungarian uprisings of 1956 The reordering of fundamental moral values so suddenly and simultaneously among a large number of people throughout the Western world hardly seems credible    Such conversions are far more readily reconciled with changes in visions than in values What these cases in capitalist and communist countries brought was new massive and intrusively insistent factual information about each social systemnot necessarily conclusive evidence but certainly painful facts sufficient to cause many to reconsider The heavy impact of startling new information may shake or shatter an individuals vision but does not in itself realign moral values Mass unemployment hunger the killing of innocents the deliberate degradation of the human spirit or the cynical unleashing of war all inspire the same horror as before What changes is the perception of who or what is doing it and why    The thrust of organized systematic propaganda especially in totalitarian states centers precisely on facts and causation as the pivots of belief Similarly in places and times where religious authorities have wielded oppressive control of ideas people such as Copernicus and Galileo have become targets not because they offered alternative value systems but because they presented alternative visions of facts and causation Existing    values seemed threatened only because the vision on which they had been based seemed threatenednot because Copernicus or Galileo were propagandizing for alternative values    Values are vitally important But the question addressed here is whether they precede or follow from visions The conclusion that they are more likely to derive from visions than visions from them is not merely the conclusion of this particular analysis but is further demonstrated by the actual behavior of those with the power to control ideas throughout a society whether those authorities be secular or religious    If individuals in substantial numbers find it possible to change their visions whether suddenly or gradually how do sharply opposed visions persist over the centuries in society at large Insofar as visions are 1 simplified projections of reality and 2 subject to contradiction by facts all visions must encounter facts contrary to their simplified premises This implies that all visions must also develop both intellectual and psychic means of coping with contradiction and that any prospect of conversion must contend with the contradictions of whatever alternative vision beckons Therefore the instantaneous conversion of a whole society seems very unlikelyand once the conversion process becomes drawn out individual mortality alone is enough to guarantee that many conversions will never be completed and that new individuals must begin the process of vision allegiance and doubt all over again from the beginning    In the physical sciences however the preservation of decisive evidence and the logically demonstrative methods of scientific analysis under controlled experimental conditions means that conversion from one vision to another can be sudden and irreversible not only for given individuals but for future individuals as well and therefore for society as a whole No one needs to reenact in his own mind the timeconsuming process by which the Ptolemaic vision of astronomy gave way to the visions of Copernicus Galileo or Einstein      While books likewise preserve records of social political and economic events and theories the absence of controlled experiments decisive evidence and decisive techniques for analyzing it mean that these records themselves become battlegrounds in the conflict of visions Disputes still rage over the reasons for the rise of Hitler or the decline and fall of the Roman Empire      VISIONS AND INTERESTS     Believers in both the constrained and the unconstrained visions have long recognized that special interests and special pleading are major factors in daytoday politics and that what is said in these political struggles has no necessary connection with the truth or even with what anyone believes to be the truth    Businessmen according to Adam Smith are a class whose interests are often to deceive and even to oppress the public so that any statements coming from them should be long and carefully examined not only with the most scrupulous but with the most suspicious attention17 He warned against the clamorous importunity of partial interests in general18 and the clamour and sophistry of merchants and manufacturers in particular19 Of political propaganda Smith observed that those who taught it were by no means such fools as they who believed it20 Much the same views have characterized modern thinkers with the constrained vision such as Friedman or Hayek21 It has equally been part of the tradition of the unconstrained vision going back to Godwin and coming forward to Shaw Galbraith or other twentiethcentury thinkers22    The relationship between special interests and any visionconstrained or unconstrainedmay be conceived of as a question whether there is 1 a direct corruption 2 a class bias or 3 a case of particular visions proving attractive to particular interests Direct corruption may be due to bribes economic selfinterest or careerism determining what is said independently of what is actually believed about the facts or causation Although such explanations are sometimes attributed to Karl Marx they are    much closer to the theories of Charles A Beard who depicted the Constitution of the United States as shaped by special interests Marxs theory was one of class bias distorting the thinkers perception of reality with sincerely held beliefs being opposite and antagonistic in content when the thinkers drew upon different class experiences The weakest of the three assertions above is that visionshowever they originatewill be pressed into service by whatever special interests find them useful    Examining first the strongest of the specialinterest explanations of visions produces virtually no evidence that the leading figures in either the constrained or unconstrained tradition stood to gain personally from the views advocated and much evidence to the contrary    The entire tradition of the unconstrained vision with its equalization emphasis has been led by individuals who stood to lose both financially and in status terms by the equalization they advocated Some were of modest means but still almost invariably above the average of their respective societies and some like Condorcet or Holbach were quite rich The policies advocated by the leading exponents of the constrained vision have likewise seldom advanced their personal interests Adam Smith who promoted both domestic and international free trade was the son of a customs official and engaged in no trade at all being primarily an academic a profession whose practices he severely criticized23 Virtually none of the leading advocates of laissezfaire have been businessmen from the time of Adam Smith to Milton Friedman or F A Hayek two centuries later24 Burkes Reflections on the Revolution in France represented views that cost him the political alliances and friendships of a lifetime and though it eventually brought him royal favor this was hardly something he could have counted on after years of having opposed royal interests in Parliament    While political thinkers who were also political practitioners may create ambiguities as to their motivations which may be either ideological or careerist increasing specialization over the centuries has made the theorist practitioner in politics almost as rare as the theoristbusinessman Leading    social theorists who were at the same time leading political figures were more common in the eighteenth century when Burke and the Federalists flourished than in later times But John Stuart Mills brief career in Parliament in the nineteenth century or Joseph A Schumpeters brief career in business in the twentieth century were oddities having little significance for their own intellectual history much less for visions in general    The less extreme claim that visions represent the bias of class position is no more readily supported by evidence The class positions of those with the constrained vision have not been consistently higher or lower than the class positions of those with the unconstrained vision and differences in class position have been considerable among those with similar views on either side    Milton Friedman was far more similar in social origins to Tom Paine than to Friedrich Hayek or James Madison While Condorcet and Holbach were aristocrats their philosophic compatriots Paine and Godwin knew what it was to struggle to make ends meet At the individual level the class explanation of ideas breaks down completely while the tracing of assumptions about human nature to conclusions about social policy show a remarkable and enduring consistency    The numerous other sociological explanations of ideological orientation need not all be rejected a priori nor is it necessary to enter into their specifics here To explain the social composition of those holding particular visionswhether the explanations be correct or incorrectis only to assert that people are not randomly distributed in their visions any more than they are randomly distributed in sports religion or a thousand other human activities None of this denies that class bias exists or plays a potent role in political struggles The question is whether its influence operates by controlling those who shape social visions or in other ways That class bias where it exists will seize upon a vision which can serve as a rationalization is scarcely denied by anyone But that has nothing to do with either the origins or validity of the vision      The very reason visions are useful to those with a special interest to promote is that it helps recruit political allies who do not share that special interest but who may be won over by the principles or rhetoric generated by a social vision In short the resort to visions as a means of recruiting political allies is evidence of the limited appeal of special interests as such and the independent power of visions The relative weights of the two forces in the short run are not the issue here However much the special interests may predominate as of a given time the special interests of one generation need not be the same as the special interests of the next generation while the constrained and unconstrained visions have both been viable for centuries      SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS     This final set of summaries and conclusions must summarize not only this chapter but the whole work and derive some of its implications Behind the episodic eruptions of specific political and social controversies is a pattern of beliefs about the world about man and about causation These implicit assumptions or visions repeatedly divide controversialists at all intellectual levels on a wide spectrum of issues and across the boundaries of the law the economy the polity and the society as well as across international boundaries Though these controversies often become emotional the opposing views tend to cluster not around an emotion but around the logic of a vision Each vision tends to generate conclusions which are the logical consequences of its assumptions That is why there are such repeated conflicts of visions in such a range of otherwise unrelated issues The analysis here is not intended to reconcile visions or determine their validity but to understand what they are about and what role they play in political economic and social struggles The question is not what particular policy or social system is best but rather what is implicitly assumed in advocating one policy or social system over another    Whatever ones vision other visions are easily misunderstoodnot only because of caricatures produced by polemics but also because the very words used equality freedom justice power mean entirely different things in the context of different presuppositions It is not merely misunderstanding but the inherent logic of each vision which leads to these semantic differences as well as to substantively different conclusions across a wide spectrum of issues Visions are inherently in conflict quite aside from the misunderstandings hostility or intransigence generated in the course of polemics      Both constrained and unconstrained visions are ultimately concerned with social results The unconstrained vision seeks directly to achieve those results sociallythat is through collective decisions prescribing the desired outcomes The constrained vision considers it beyond the capability of any manageable set of decisionmakers to marshal the requisite knowledge and dangerous to concentrate sufficient power to carry out their decisions even if it were possible    Given the unconstrained vision which permits results to be directly prescribed its basic concepts are expressed in terms of results The degree of freedom is thus the degree to which ones desires can be realized without regard to whether the obstacles to full realization be the deliberately imposed restrictions of government or the lack of circumstantial prerequisites Justice is likewise a question of outcomes and the justice or injustice of a society can therefore be determined directly by those outcomes whether they be the result of conscious decisions social attitudes or circumstances inherited from the past Power is likewise defined by results If A can cause B to do what A wants done then A has power over B regardless of whether As inducements to B are positive rewards or negative penalties Equality too is a result the degree of equality or inequality being a directly observable fact    All these basic terms are defined in profoundly different ways under the assumptions of the constrained vision One consequence of this is that those with different visions often argue past each other even when they accept the same rules of logic and utilize the same data for the same terms of discourse signify very different things In the constrained vision where man cannot directly create social results but only social processes it is as characteristics of those processes that freedom justice power and equality have significance A social process has freedom to the extent that it refrains from interfering with the choices of individualswhether or not the circumstances of those individuals provide them with many options or few A social process has justice to the extent that its rules are just regardless of the variety of outcomes resulting from the application of those rules Power is exerted in social processes by individuals or by institutions to the extent that someones existing set of options is reducedbut it is not an exertion    of power to offer a quid pro quo that adds to his existing options Equality as a process characteristic means application of the same rules to all without regard to individual antecedent conditions or subsequent results Results matterthey are the ultimate justification of processesbut it is only the general effectiveness of particular processes competitive markets constitutional government that can be gauged by man not each individual result in isolation    The clash between the two visions is not over the actual or desirable degree of freedom justice power or equalityor over the fact that there can only be degrees and not absolutesbut rather over what these things consist of in whatever degree they occur Moreover the relationship between the two visions reflects not only logical differences but also the historical ascendancy of one or the other vision at a given time Because some of the key concepts used by both sides were first defined primarily in the terms of the constrained vision those with the unconstrained vision have had to distinguish their concepts as real freedom or real equality for example as contrasted with merely formal freedom or equality However the later ascendancy of the unconstrained vision forced those with the constrained vision into a defensive posture in which they tried to reestablish the former more limited definitions of such terms as process characteristics    In addition to these changing asymmetric relationships between the two visions there is an enduring asymmetric relationship based on how they see each other as adversaries Each must regard the other as mistaken but the reasons for the mistake are different In the unconstrained vision in which man can master social complexities sufficiently to apply directly the logic and morality of the common good the presence of highly educated and intelligent people diametrically opposed to policies aimed at that common good is either an intellectual puzzle or a moral outrage or both Implications of bad faith venality or other moral or intellectual deficiencies have been much more common in the unconstrained visions criticisms of the constrained vision than vice versa      In the constrained vision where the individuals capacity for direct social decisionmaking is quite limited it is far less surprising that those who attempt it should failand therefore far less necessary to regard the mistaken adversary as having less morality or intelligence than others Those with the constrained vision tend to refer to their adversaries as well meaning but mistaken or unrealistic in their assumptions with seldom a suggestion that they are deliberately opposing the common good or are too stupid to recognize it Personality variations cut across these patterns on both sidesBurke was less generous to adversaries than Hayek Shaw less accusatory than Condorcetbut the patterns themselves have persisted for centuries    Malthus said I cannot doubt the talents of such men as Godwin and Condorcet I am unwilling to doubt their candor25 But when Godwin wrote of Malthus he called him malignant26 questioned the humanity of the man27 said I profess myself at a loss to conceive of what earth the man was made28 and hinted that Malthus appointment as Professor at East India College was a reward for apologetics for the privileged29 In the twentieth century Friedrich Hayeks landmark book The Road to Serfdom made him a moral leper to many30 though in that book he was very generous to his adversaries whom he characterized as singleminded idealists31 and as authors whose sincerity and disinterestedness are above suspicion32 Further examples could be multiplied almost without limit The point here is that these differences reflect more than personality differences and are themselves part of an enduring pattern growing out of the fundamental assumptions of the two visions    The two visions differ not only in how they see differences between themselves but also in how they see differences between ordinary individuals and those more intellectually or morally advanced In the unconstrained vision where the intellectual and moral potential of man vastly exceeds the levels currently observable in the general population there is more room for individual variation in intellectual and moral performance than in the constrained vision where the elite and the masses are both penned within relatively narrow limits Striking moral and    intellectual differences are recognized by those with the constrained vision but are regarded as either too exceptional to form the basis of social policy or as confined to a small area out of a vast spectrum of human concerns Given the inherent limitations of human beings the extraordinary person morally or intellectually is extraordinary only within some very limited area perhaps at the cost of grave deficiencies elsewhere and may well have blind spots which prevent him from seeing some things which are clearly visible to ordinary people    Differences between the moralintellectual elite and the masses are crucial especially to modern conflicts of visions over the degree of surrogate decisionmaking whether by politicians judges or various agencies and commissions Both visions try to make the locus of discretion coincide with the locus of knowledge but they conceive of knowledge in such radically different terms as to lead to opposite conclusions as to where discretion should be vested    To those with the unconstrained vision who see knowledge and reason as concentrated in those who have advanced furthest toward the ultimate potential of man surrogate decisionmakingeconomic planning judicial activism etcis essential These surrogate decisionmakers must attempt both to influence beforehand and to revise afterward the decisions made by those less accomplished in intellectual or moral terms But to those with the constrained vision each individuals knowledge is so grossly inadequate compared to the knowledge mobilized systemically through economic markets traditional values and other social processes that surrogate decisionmakers in generaland nonelected judges in particular should severely limit themselves to drawing up rules defining the boundaries of others discretion not secondguess the decisions actually made within those boundaries In the constrained vision the loci of discretion should be as widely scattered as possible the inevitable errors resulting being accepted as a tradeoff no solution being possible    Conflicts of visions affect not only such large and enduring issues as economic planning versus laissezfaire or judicial activism versus judicial    restraint but also such new issues as the most effective modes of Third World development affirmative action or comparable worth In each of these controversies the assumptions of one vision lead logically to opposite conclusions from those of the other All these issues turn ultimately on whether or to what extent surrogate decisionmakers can make better decisions than those directly transacting Even with perfect agreement on value premises as to what outcome would be ideal differences in beliefs as to the efficacy of particular policies would put those with different visions in sharp conflict    Visions help explain ideological differences which are of course only one source of political differences Yet in the long run these ideological conflicts seem to shape the general course of political trends as much as practical political considerations dominate daytoday events To a considerable extent the ideological presuppositions of the times set the limits and the agenda which determine what is feasible realistic or imperative to practical politicians    Powerful as ideology may be it is not omnipotent Inescapable and brutal factsthe Great Depression of the 1930s the NaziSoviet pact of 1939 have caused many to simultaneously embrace or abandon an ideology Even short of such cataclysmic events the rules of logic and evidence have historically led many to change ideological positions suddenly or gradually Moveover even when an ideological bias persists the empirical or logical work of those with such a bias may not necessarily sufferby empirical or logical standardshowever much the semantics used to characterize the findings may betray the ideological leanings of the analyst33 For still others however ideology may totally overwhelm evidence    Emotions and value judgments are importantbut derivative It is as logical for those with the unconstrained vision to put freedom of speech above property rights as it is for those with the constrained vision to bitterly oppose them on this as in so many other issues      While not all social theories can be neatly divided into constrained and unconstrained visions what is remarkable is how many of the leading theories of the past two centuries or more fall into one or the other of these two categories Personal and stylistic differences as well as differences of subject emphasis and degree are all superimposed on this dichotomy but the dichotomy itself still shows through nevertheless    Logic is of course not the only test of a theory Empirical evidence is crucial intellectually and yet historically social visions have shown a remarkable ability to evade suppress or explain away discordant evidence to a degree that scientific theories cannot match Yet for individuals changes of visions have not been uncommon and catastrophic historic events have created many road to Damascus conversions The hybrid vision of fascism once touted as the wave of the future has been devastated by the experience of World War II    In short evidence is not wholly irrelevant even to visions even historicallyand it is of course crucial logically Historic evasions of evidence are a warning not a model Too often the mere fact that someone is known to disagree widely on other issues is considered sufficient reason not to take him seriously on the issue at hand How can you believe someone who has said     In short the fact that an opposing vision has as much consistency across a range of issues as ones own is used as a reason to reject it out of hand This is especially so when the reasons for the differences are thought to be value premises so that opponents are conceived to be working toward morally incompatible goals    Emphasis on the logic of a vision in no way denies that emotional or psychological factors or narrow selfinterest may account for the attraction of some people to particular visions The point is that neither the validity nor the consequences of a vision can be determined by examining such factorsthat the vision has a logic and a momentum of its own going beyond the emotions or intentions of its constituency at a given moment Moreover those subsequently attracted to a particular vision may be quite    different from those initially attracted and attracted for quite different reasons as the consequences of the vision unfold34    While visions conflict and arouse strong emotions in the process merely winning cannot be the ultimate goal of either the constrained or the unconstrained vision however much that goal may preoccupy practical politicians The moral impulse driving each vision cannot be jettisoned for the sake of winning without making the victory meaningless While defections from one vision to another may be occasioned by empirical evidence it is usually the relevance of that evidence for the prospects of achieving some morally desirable goal that is decisive    An analysis of the implications and dynamics of visions can clarify issues without reducing dedication to ones own vision even when it is understood to be a vision rather than an incontrovertible fact an iron law or an opaque moral imperative Dedication to a cause may legitimately entail sacrifices of personal interests but not sacrifices of mind or conscience      NOTES    The epigraph is from Bertrand Russell Skeptical Essays

RECENT  Published on November 25 2019  Why Do Progressives Hate Gentrication  written by Coleman Hughes  The word gentrication was coined in 1964 to describe the inux of wealthy newcomers into  lowincome innercity neighborhoods resulting in rising property values changes in  neighborhood culture and displacement of original residents Though gentrication predates  the modern era it has only become the target of criticism in recent decades as cities like  S H A R E     Privacy  Cookies This site uses cookies By continuing to use this website you agree to their use  To nd out more

httpsquillettecom20191125whydoprogressiveshategentrification 216  Washington DC Atlanta and Boston have witnessed rapid transformations Opponents of  gentrication have ranged from residents directly aected by it to wealthy college students  directly responsible for it as well as prominent Democrats such as Bernie Sanders Cory  Booker and Alexandria OcasioCortez  Critics of gentrication give two main reasons for their opposition 1 wealthy newcomers  drive up monthly rents thereby displacing original residents and 2 rapid change to  neighborhood culture represents an injustice to original residents Both critiques are  magnied by the presumed skin color of the gentriers and the gentried who tend to be  white and black or Hispanic respectively  Though such critiques may seem reasonable at rst glance neither of them survive scrutiny  Not only is gentrication harmless its actually benecial Indeed for reasons I will lay out its  exactly the kind of thing that progressives should support  Lets begin with the charge that gentrication displaces original residents Two economists  used data from the 2000 US Census and the 20102014 American Community Survey to  track individual outcomes for all residents of gentriableor lowincome innercity  neighborhoods in Americas one hundred largest metropolitan areas The largest study of its  kind it divided residents of gentriable neighborhoods into two categories based on  educational attainment Their ndings refute the displacement narrative conclusively  Firstly residents of gentriable neighborhoods move frequentlywith or without  gentrication In all gentriable neighborhoods over 60 percent of lesseducated renters  moved apartments over the course of a decade From that baseline rate of outmigration  neighborhoods that gentried saw an additional 4 to 6 percentage point increase The study  authors interpret this to mean that gentrication caused at most a ten percent 6 out of 60  SHARE     Privacy  Cookies This site

in outmigration In other words less than oneinten disadvantaged renters who  move out of a gentrifying neighborhood are moving because of gentrication  What happens to that less than oneinten On average that person moves to a  neighborhood that is just as good as the one they le As the study authors put it we nd no  evidence that movers from gentrifying neighborhoods including the most disadvantaged  residents move to observably worse neighborhoods or experience negative changes to  employment income or commuting distance  But doesnt gentrication increase the monthly rent for residents who choose to stay It does  the study found but only for moreeducated renters The study authors observe that  somewhat surprisingly gentrication has no eect on reported monthly rents paid by  original resident lesseducated renters emphasis mine They dont know why rent increases  for one group but not the other but they speculate that it could be because of rental market  segmentation greater willingness to pay among moreeducated renters or sticky rents  On the whole progressives ought to love gentrication It makes black innercity  homeowners wealthier Among lesseducated homeownerswho are majority nonwhite and  comprise over a quarter of the total population in gentriable neighborhoodsthose who  remained in gentried neighborhoods saw a 15000 increase in the value of their homes due  to gentrication Among moreeducated homeownerswho are also majority nonwhite  those who remained saw a 20000 increase in property value  Whats more gentrication breaks up concentrated poverty and reduces residential  segregation Progressives have frequently observed that poor blacks are more likely to live in  concentrated poverty than poor whites As a result they lose out on the advantages that come  with living in a mixedincome neighborhood Gentrication helps solve this problem  Moreover progressives oen observe that residential segregation remains pervasive half a  century aer the 1968 Fair Housing Act Gentrication helps solve that problem too  SHARE     Privacy  Cookies This site uses cookies By continuing to use this website you agree to their use  To nd out more

httpsquillettecom20191125whydoprogressiveshategentrification 416  If a Democratic president were to implement a policy that substantially increased the net  worth of tens of thousands of black innercity residents decreased residential segregation  and broke up concentrated povertyall at no cost to taxpayersthey would go down as one  of the greatest progressive presidents in recent history Yet despite the fact that its eects are  identical progressives view gentrication as at best regrettable and at worst evil The  following passage from TaNehisi Coatess We Were Eight Years in Power is representative  The question is why do so many progressives take this stance One reason might be that they  worry about the second kind of harm that accompanies gentrication the changing culture  and character of neighborhoods People dont like change and its reasonable to worry that  rapid cultural change is a kind of injustice  But the fact that gentrication causes almost no displacement suggests that cultural change  doesnt matter much to those directly aected Compared to the speed with which people will  ee a neighborhood when crime rises for instance the level of urgency that accompanies  antigentrication sentiment is low The existence of highly visible exceptions such as anti  gentrication community activist groups hardly undermines my point A few dozen  protesters will receive news coverage creating the false perception of widespread opposition  to cultural change But you will never hear about the thousands of black innercity renters  and homeowners who dont care about or love gentrication  Whether or not concerns about cultural change have merit its clear that they are not the  driving force behind progressive opposition to gentrication Indeed the main reason  progressives oppose gentrication has less to do with the wellbeing of the gentried than  with the race of the gentriers If you doubt this consider the following hypothetical imagine  that the gentriers instead of being white were highskilled immigrants from India The  economic eects of gentrication would be identical rising rents for moreeducated original  residents rising property values for all minimal displacement and so on The cultural shock  would be dierent in kind but identical in degree instead of artisan coee shops ooding  Harlem you might see for example Indian grocery stores  I know that gentrication is but a more pleasing name for white supremacy is the  interest on enslavement the interest on Jim Crow the interest on redlining  compounding across the years and these new urbanites living o of that interest are  all of them exulting in a crime To speak the word gentrication is to immediately lie  SHARE     Privacy  Cookies This site uses cookies By continuing to use this website

 httpsquillettecom20191125whydoprogressiveshategentrification 516  In this scenario can you imagine college students at elite universities railing against  gentrication day in and day out Can you imagine prominent Democrats making opposition  to gentrication a pillar of their housing policy Perhaps But it is far more likely that if the  skin color of the gentriers were to change as if by magic most of the outrage over  gentrication would disappear  Without doubt the strain of antiwhite sentiment that runs through progressive thinking is  not identicalin kind or degreeto antiblack racism Progressives do not feel for example  that white people are unintelligent dirty or unattractive Progressive antiwhiteness more  closely resembles communist hatred of the bourgeoisie It is a conspiratorial bigotry that  ascribes to white people a mercenary nature a high level of competence and an innate desire  for dominance  Such antiwhite sentiment not only explains much of progressive opposition to gentrication  it also explains why the New York Times ran a column arguing that we should teach black  children not to befriend white children it explains why the Hungton Post ran a piece  advocating the metaphorical wounding of white people en masse and it explains why Sarah  Jeong got hired by the Times despite authoring a series of antiwhite tweets that would have  been careerending were they about any other race  All of this matters for two reasons Firstly opposition to gentrication has consequences  Measures intended to curb gentrication such as rent control and zoning laws perversely  make housing less aordable for the poor and wealthy alike  But more importantly antiwhite sentiment does not go unnoticed outside of the progressive  bubble And whatever wall of irony allegedly separates progressive whitebashing from true  bigotry gets lost in translation across the political divide The path back to normalcy for  American democracy the path away from

MorganFoster  I cant think of a single example of American democracy or culture returning to an older better time The  path back is a nostalgic daydream There is only a series of paths forward for any of us  Well now lately Ive been thinking that the path toward rightwing populism isnt necessarily a bad thing  for me or my family or my closest friends It may actually be a good thing I dont think it automatically  leads to fascism although there is a risk And anyway isnt rightwing populism just a lewing dog  whistle meaning conservatives voting  The way things are going  forward and not on the path back  political tribalism just might be the saving  of me  I do think its in my best interest that the Democratic Party not survive in its current state I would very  much like to see the party splinter into two or more separate parties politically weakening all progressives  and doing real harm to the Socialist Project  From my perspective this would be the better outcome   Thersites  For decades there has been voiced opposition to a process of urban renewal that results in pricing poor  residents out of the rental market That many on the le now condone antiwhite racism and incorporate

unfortunately in the present issues sweepstakes everything takes on the trappings of a  crusade and the advocates with the highest level of hysteria win the media attention It fosters a grievance  industry that feeds o our baser instincts  When debating increasing costs of living it is advantageous to know the specics for the community in  question For example simply reducing crime can have a long term upward eect on housing prices Is the  reason for the uptick in housing due to some nefarious developer or the positive collective action of the  local residents What ever the reasons dont look to the ideology of those who run California for solutions  Their state is suering simultaneously from both urban blight and increasingly high housing costs that  torment the poor and are driving out the middle class Hopefully the majority outside of the aloof class will  soon understand their representatives do not represent them   Ike  I absolutely love gentrication As a contractor it means home improvements retail and commercial space  buildouts and the chance to do interesting restoration work on old and historic residences and buildings  I dont know how you can argue that gentrication is economically a detriment or even lateral based on the  volume of jobs created alone  For the record I think Coates is a shameless race hustler half a step up from the likes of al sharpton but Id  still love to work on his 21 million dollar home in Brooklyn Shoot him my info if hes thinking about  renovations   jdfree49  The gentrication conversation reveals the dishonesty of the Les talk about diversity and tolerance  The Le wants white people displaced by nonwhite people It wants neighborhoods where white culture  exists to be replaced with nonwhite culture It doesnt want any white person to be able to go back to where  he grew up and experience the community he grew up in if that community is white It wants to stigmatize  even the slightest nostalgia for a white community  But swap white with any nonwhite ethnicity and the Les position swaps with it A culturally  homogeneous nonwhite neighborhood must not be tainted by awful whiteness Its a tragedy if nonwhite kids  S H A R E

any community is  NOT diversity and must not be tolerated  Diversity is a dog whistle for antiwhite  As for an objective analysis of gentrication its quite simple Communities in choice locations are either  expensive or dilapidated There is no third option If they are dilapidated they will have poor residents and  the Le will complain about the conditions those residents are enduring Fixing the dilapidation costs  money and results in the community becoming expensive Those are the choices stay dilapidated or  become expensive The Le will complain either way because complaining is what Leists do  Fixing dilapidation is the preferred option every time because resources should be put to their highest and  best use Society is overall better o and greener when the people who have the highpaying inner city  jobs live near their workplaces Lowpaying jobs are relatively fungible Yes some lowskilled people will  have to commute to the downtown area to perform its service jobs but they

white and thus told that we are wreaking  genocide on this historically black neighborhood and we are all inherently racist and dont ask the  facilitator of this bon homie how we can help  subtext

read such illuminating racist commentary on the BedStuy Facebook page The neighborhood  is safer and the housing stock more valuable I dont like it because I cant aord it But anyone whos owned  here will make a mintand the only way to retain a certain skin color here is to discriminate against whites  wanting to buy in  And thats RACIST   Dcl  Progressives do not feel for example that white people are unintelligent dirty or unattractive  The one sentence I disagree with in this otherwise excellent essay  Progressives do feel that white people are unintelligent dirty and unattractive Racist bitter clingers of  their guns and religions too They just dont categorize themselves as those type of white people When  they say white people they perform a sort of cognitive dissonance trick what they really mean is  everyone but upper classintelligentsia white people aka yover country  Progressives exclude themselves from their condemnations This is how it ties into what the author refers to  as the communist hatred of the bourgeoisie They use white to stand in for class as well as raceethnicity  This is why they never oer to step down from their lucrative or powerful positions and let a poor Brown or  Black person take their place The idea is that its the lower orders that have to step aside not they They  fully intend to stay in power and indeed the whole exercise is an exercise in power dynamics wherein  under the veil of righteousness they grab power any way they can using Black people as tools and symbols  of their own Woke Priestly Power This is also why theyre against gentrication They dont live there It  costs them nothing Who is likely to live in newly gentried areas Why the lower orders Including  as in  the urban area I work in  working class new immigrants Indian Arab and AsianTheir races arent the right  ones as Hughes points out so no one calls it gentrication But the other issue is the progressives are  utterly unaware of the gentrication because its not an area they go to its too low class for them and  lled with crime and violence they want to pretend doesnt exist  S H A R E     Privacy  Cookies This site uses cookies By continuing

known as male pattern baldness   The first indication of inevitable and irreversible hair loss is   NorwoodHamilton stage II characterized by a 50 areal increase   in temporal recession over the course of about five years  Once NorwoodHamilton stage II is complete the balding process   will continue until you die when your corpse will rot in the ground   and worms will eat your eyeballs

a phi losophically oriented historian a thinker  Why grapple with a body of thought that is difficult often elusive Why  forsake the pleasures of sport the company of fri ends a nove l or a  videogame for the slow patient activity of coming to understand a set of  texts that far from inviting one in seem often designed to keep one at bay   These are nor id le questions One might be told in response to them that  the rigours of thought are good for the mind that grappling with difficu lt  concepts is bracing or strengthening or a sign of good character These  are it seems rome bad answers Nor that a person should nor have a good  mind or a good character But why study philosophy in order to ach ieve  these Would mathematics or physics or the law nor do just as well There  is nothing less rigorous about these disciplines than there is about ph ilo sophy They offer challenges to the mind and in addition training in  something that might come in handy down the road   If one is to study a philosophical figure if one is to paraphrase James  Joyce to forge ones own soul in the smithy of the ir mind there must be a  better reason on offer than simply being told that conceptual difficu lty is  good for you There must be something about rhe thinkers being philo sophical or in the case of Michel Foucault at least philosophically ori ented that is itself compell ing T hat reason need nor be practical in the  trad itional sense of the term It need nor lead ro a job or a social position  or recognition by a broader public Ideology asid e there is no reason to  believe that these are all that people seek T he reason one might study a  ph ilosopher can be less goaloriented or more subtle Bur given the alter native ways of spending ones rime the reason ought to be a good one   The ph ilosopher Gilles Deleuze te lls us that   a ph ilosophical theory is an elaborately developed question and  nothing else by itself and in itself it is nor the reso lution ro a   1     THE PHilOSOPHY O f FOUCAULT   problem bm the elaboration to the very end of the necessary im plications of a formulated quest ion 1r shows us what things are or  what things should be on the assumption rhal the question is good  and rigorous 1   Deleuze suggests that a ph ilosophical theory is nor to be defined by the  answer it gives bur by the question it asks T he poinr of reading philosophy  ro him is nor one of seeking solurions bur of elaborating the impl ications  of a question    We must be clear here Deleuze is nor argu ing that philosophy is about  questions rather than abom answers Or at least he is nor arguing it in any  simple way He is nor saying only that it is the questions that marrer rather  than the answers There is something em pry after all in being rold that if  one asks the right question then what comes after does nor marrer Vhar  wou ld the poinr o f asking a question be if the response did nor somehow  marrer When he talks abour rhe elaboration of rhe necessary implications  of a formu lated question he is talking nor only abour questions bur also  abour responses T hose responses those elaborations however need nor  be as straigh tforward as answers ro traditional questions T hey need nor be  as narrow as answers to questions such as Where do you live or What is  the GNP of Sierra Leone They can be difficu lt or shifting or openended  If they are robe worthwhile however they need to respond to a quest ion  thar is good and rigorous And that is where the riches of philosophy lie   T he poinr of reading phi losophers is to follow their elaboration of the  implications of a good and rigorous question  If the question is worthwhile  if it is a matter of what Deleuze elsewhere calls  the lnreresting Remark able or lmporranr then there is a reason to engage in studying it  If we  are to ask ourselves whether a ph ilosophical work or a body of phi losoph ical thought is worth pausing over then we must sooner or later know the  question that is being elaborated   For Foucault there is rhroughom the body of lis work a single quest ion  that receives elaboration It is the question Who are we This is not the  only question he elaborates Yet it is the one he asks most doggedly the one  that is never far from the surface of any of his works In his hands the ques tion of who we are becomes a rigorous one elaborated if not to the very  end then very far along the way   The question of who we are or at least that of who each among us is will  be foreign to no one Who has not at least once or twice asked this ques tion And when asked seriously rigorously its answer  or its response  is  not obvious There are of course many insriturions in our society that seem  to provide easy answers Our churches tel l us you are a ch ild of God Our  pol iticians tell us you are an American or an Australian or an Indian   2     INTRODUCTION  WHO ARE WE   or   Our televisions tell us you are a consumer We are told who we  are and as a resu lt we rarely ask Bm if we do nor aslk often we do ask some rimes at momems when the obvious answers seem ro fa ll away in the wake  of a tragedy or when boredom overcomes us and the easy answers lose  their grip or more rarely when a philosopher purs rhe question ro us in a  nev way   There are many ways ro ask the question of who I am or of who we are  Foucault mrns rhe question reformulares ir asks it in a new way To under stand how he does so ro grasp the particular rigour he brings ro the ques t ion we must comrasr ir with other more trad itional ways of asking and  elaborari ng   We could do worse than ro starr with Rene Descartes Although he is  concerned more with the question of what we could know than of who we  are his legacy is perhaps greater in regard ro rhe second question The re sponse he gives ro the question of who we are is srlill with us it srill defines  rhe framework wirhin which most of us ask rhe question The legacy of  Descartes one of rhe legacies Foucaulr will seek to undermine  remains  our inheritance How then does he answer rhe question of who we are   For Descarres rhe cemral quesrion is one of whar we could know And  the problem is rhar he wams robe able ro give our knowledge a more solid  foundarion than merely a reliance on fairh He himself probably pms rhe  issue besr ar rhe beginning of his Meditations in an iron ic passage rhar at  once challenges and denies rhar he is challenging rhe church amhoriries   lr is absolurely rrue borh rhar we musr believe rhar rhere is a God  because ir is so raughr in rhe Holy Scripmres and on rhe orher  hand rhar we musr believe rhe Holy Scripmres because rhey come  from God   Nevertheless we could hardly offer rhis argumem  ro rhose wirhour fairh for rhey mighr suppose rhar we were com mining rhe fallacy rhar logicians call circular reasoning3   Suppose indeed Descartes learns from rhe churchs censure of Galileo ro  be circumspect in his deviarions from church orthodoxy   The foundarion he offers is well known lr occurs in rwo sreps firsr a  proof of rhe exisrence of God and secondly a proof rhar God cannot be a  deceiver lr is in rhe first srep rhar he begins ro answer rhe question of who  we are The firsr move in rhe firsr step is ro doubr everyrhing rhar he can nor  be absolurely cerrain of Whar remains after such doubr Only rhe exisrence  of a doubrer of a subsrance rhar rhinks perceives imagines ere Thar as ir  wi ll mrn om is one of rhe rwo subsrances rhar comprise a human being  The orher substance is physical marrer There is a rhird subsrance in rhe  universe as well rhar of rhe divine Bm ir is menral subsrance rhar is rhe   3     THE PHilOSOPHY O f FOUCAULT   key T hat is what allows him ro construct his proof of God and what seems  most imporranr abour who we are T he other substance  physical matter does nor make its appearance unri l rhe sixth and last of his meditat ions  There the existence of physica l matter in general and Descartess own  body in particular is a conclusion he arrives a r on the basis of earlier  proofs namely if God exists and is nor a deceiver then so much of what I  experience as corporeal matter must be corre lated with my actual ly having  a body I also recognize in myself some other facu lties such as rhe power  of changing location of assuming various postures and other similar ones  which cannot be conceived withour some substance in which they inhere   4   So who are we We are beings made up of two substances a mental sub stance and a physical substance T hese substances are inrimately related  Indeed Descartes thinks they actually meet ar a particular po inr rhe pineal  gland5 Bur rhe fact that rhey meet does nor mean that rhey are the same  kind of substance He writes of rhe bodys characteristics rhar   if ir is true that they exist they must inhere in some corporeal or  ex tended substance and not in an inrelligenr substance since their  clear and distinct concept does actua lly involve some sort of exten sion bur no sort of intelligence wharsoever6   Of these two substances it is rhe mind that is tlhe most important in sev eral respects Fi rst rhe body cannot be conceived without it Second ir is  rhe seat of our highest capacities those of thinking judging and free choice  Final ly iris rhe mind rhe menral substance rhar gives rhe body rhe particu lar animation ir has lr is nor rhat rhe body would not have any ani marion  without rhe mind Descartes argues rhar rhe bodly could ar least in prin ciple operate on its own The human body he tells us   may be considered as a machine so bui lt and composed of bones  nerves muscles veins blood and skin rhar even if there were no  mind in ir it would not cease ro move in all rhe ways rhat ir does ar  present when it is nor moved under the direction of the will nor  consequenrly wi rh rhe aid of the mind bur only by rhe condition of  its organs7   But ro do rhe particular things rhar a particular body does in the way that ir  does them requires a mind to be attached ro ir   This way of thinking of ourselves remains with us 1r has been passed  down ro us through our JudeoChrisrian legacy which in many ways both  influenced and then followed Descartes T he main stream of this t rad ition   4     INTRODUCTION  WHO ARE WE   holds the body to be a substance characterized by fau lt or sin or weakness  and the mind robe a substance capable if ir so chooses of departing from  that corporeal inheritance Think of such phrases as mind over matter or  you can do anything you pur your mind ro or  its all in your mind  These cliches and so many like them reveal a particular cultural inherit ance committed ro rwo ideas First there is an important separation be tween mind and body a separation that Descartes characterizes by say ing  rhar they are different substances Secondly in this separation the mental is  privi leged with respect to the physical   Many current scientists wou ld dispute Descartess claim that there is a  mental substance distinct from the physical one They believe that what is  called mental substance is nothing more than the working of the brain or  more broadly of the body Foucaults writings by the way are nor con trary to such a viewpoint However the weight of tradition lies heavily on  most of us and it remains difficult to think of ourselves otherwise than as  beings rhar are defined as a particular combination of mind and body Even  when we seek to escape this inheritance it finds it way back through our  speech and into our conception of ourselves Foucault is cognizant of this  and uses ir as we shall see in derai l later ro invert our JudeoChrisrian  legacy when he declares in his book on the prisons that the soul is the  prison of the body DP 30   If we set Descartes aside for a moment to turn to a more nearly contem porary thinker we shall see beyond surface differences important simi larities rhar run through the philosophical tradition At first ir may be hard  ro imagine a thinker more different from Descartes than Sigmund Freud  Whereas Descartes privi leges consciousness Freud privileges the uncon scious Where Descartes sees a large measure of free will Freud sees a long  and often unsuccessful struggle to attain any freedom Where Descartes  allows reason to rid us of the burden of false conceptions Freud sees us as  being burdened by a history whose legacy one can never entire ly escape   So who are we in Freuds view This is a difficult question to answer  and nor only because his writings can be elusive Feud seems to present us  with rwo distinct topographies of the mind one that dominates his earl ier  writings and another that appears later on The first one in which the dis t inction between the conscious and the unconscious dominates wi ll be our  focus The second one with irs tripartite division into id ego and superego  can be interpreted in ligh t of the earl ier one and we shall leave it aside   To think of human beings as having an unconscious and furthermore to  think of who they are as being largely a matter of what happens in that un conscious and how it expresses itself is a revolutionary idea at the rime of  Freuds wri tings in the early twentieth century He thinks of the idea as the  third great blow to humanitys view of itself as a privileged being in the   5     THE PHilOSOPHY O f FOUCAULT   universe after Copernicuss d iscovery that the earth revolves around the  sun and Darwin s discovery of the evolution of species   Human megalomania will have suffered its third and most wound ing blow from the psychological research of the present time which  seeks to prove to the ego that it is not even the master of its own  house bur must content itself with scanty information of what is  going on unconsciously in its mind   To say that we are largely a maner of our unconscious is to remove us from  what the philosophical tradition has taught us to consider as our special  relation ro reason and selfawareness a special re lation that is central to  Descartes among others   For Freud who each of us is concerns how we I ive the historical confl icts  that characterize our early life Although the particular character of those  conflicts is unique ro each of us there is a general pattern that all of them  follow First those confl icts are cenrred around oral issues then anal ones  Next and most important they concern the Oedipal complex or for girls  the Elect ra complex Taking the boys developmenr as exemplary  which  is Freuds approach the boy falls in love with his mother He would like to  be rid of his father who after all is the competition for his love However  he fears the consequences of his fathers wrath as Freud has it castration  is the imagined consequence Therefore the boy must suppress his feelings  for his mother This suppression creates an unconscious wh ich in turn  swallows much of the boys preOedipal history and sets the stage for the  resolution of later conflicts   As Freud conceives the unconscious it is not merely a container for  conflicts or a safe haven for unacceptable feelings or thoughts The uncon scious does not merely receive it also expresses Just as it incorporates  situations in later life repressing the elements of those situations that  remind us of earlier d ifficulties so it emerges in indi rect ways in our beha viour For Freud jo kes symptoms and slips of the tongue are ways the  unconscious can express itself in our behaviour without those expressions  being recognized for what they are   One way to describe who we are then is as a certain type of engagement  with the world an engagemenr that operates largely on an unconscious  economy of repression and expression This economy is one that with the  help of a psychoanalyst we can come to understand at least to a certain  extent We need the aid of an analyst because the unconscious has no moti vation to reveal itself moreover the project of selfunderstanding is in  Freuds view a neverending one Therefore each of us can through a long  and often painful process and with the assistance of another come to some   6     INTRODUCTION  WHO ARE WE   recogn ition of who we are and perhaps can do something to overcome  those aspects of ourselves that we would rather be rid of Bur this abi lity is  limited and is gained at a high price   The other way to describe who we are is as a set of more or less success fully resolved confl icts This way of describing us is not in conflict with the  fi rst Rather it focuses on a different aspect of Freuds view on the history  rather than the topography If we are on the one hand largely an uncon scious relation wi th the world it is because we are on the other a deter mined set of conflicts that each of us faces Those conflicts again are at  once universal and individual They are universal in that they unfold  according to a pattern that holds for all human beings They are individual  in that that pattern is inflected in particular ways d epending on a persons  particular history   The conrrast between Freuds focus on the unconscious and Descartess  primacy of the conscious mind could nor be sharper Although the possib ility of the unconscious does not occur to Descartes it wou ld be safe to  say that if it d id he would reject it It runs against the entire grain of his  ph ilosophy with its focus on conscious rationality tvloreover one might  well say that the idea of an unconscious vio lates the claim that God is not  a deceiver since the point of the unconscious is to engage in a systematic  deception of consciousness If for instance the little boy recogn izes that  he is suppressing his hatred and fear of his father and later comes to under stand that some of his actions express that hatred and that fear the uncon scious would nor be performing irs function   Although these differences are crucial there are important simi lari ties  between the approaches of Descartes and Freud Two of them are funda mental for understanding Foucaults approach to rhe question of who we  are their individualized approach and although it may seem to be the  opposite their universal character   Vhen Descartes and Freud ask who we are they approach the question  by ask ing who each of us is in his or her nature The we of who we are is  not a collective we It is an individual I For Descartes the answer to the  question of who we are is in irs most important elements the same as the  answer to the question of who each of us is Each of us is a mindsubstance  and a bodysubstance engaged with each other in which the mind  the  conscious rational mind  is the dominanr aspect That we could be who  we are as a result of a collective experience is irrelevant for him This is not  to say that he denies that people have a co llective experience It is rather to  say that in undertaking to answer the question of who we are he does not  consider it It is neglected rather than rejected   With Freud the situation is more complicated On the one hand he does  allow for collective experience In fact his book Moses and Monotheism   7     THE PHilOSOPHY O f FOUCAULT   speculates that one of the seeds of the Oedipal complex may be a result of  the murder of Moses by the Jewish people This would lend a historical and  co llective aspect to his deve lopmental narrative In addition he allows that  the particularity of a persons confl icts may be a result of his or her particu lar history This seems to open the door to a collective determination of  who someone is an experience that one shares with others On the other  hand he gives a fai rly finegrained interpretation of human development  one that privileges the unfolding of the ind ividual within a developmental  pattern that depends on what each individual undergoes Who we are is a  matter of who each of us is in the particular way each of us resolves a pre determined set of confl icts   And here we can see the intersection of the ind ividualized approach and  the universal one For Freud as for Descartes the universal and the indi vidual go hand in hand It is because they both have a universal approach to  who each of us is that Freud and Descartes are focused on the ind ividual  rather than the collective How can this be To the extent that one believes  that who we are has a universal character that it is the same across rimes  and places one will also believe that the particularities of a person s or a  societys history are irrelevant in determining who one is It is to believe  that what is essential about us is immune to the contingencies of a changing  history To pur the point another way it is to believe that what is essential  about us is something that each of us contains regardless of our or our cul tures or socierys particular experiences or histor ies And rhus what makes  us who we are is something that is at once t imelessly uni versal and radically  ind ividual   Much of the history of philosophy will confirm this strange connivance  between the universal and the individual in the approach to who we are  For a final example one that might seem to fly in the face of what I have just  said we can look towards a more recent thinker JeanPau l Sarrre Sarrres  career overlaps with Foucaults In fact he inhabits the intellectual genera tion that precedes Foucaults the generation of the existential ists For  Sartre especially in his earlier more purely existential writings the answer  to the question of who we are can be summed up in a single word  freedom   Sarrre rejects any outside determination of who we are We are simply  what we choose robe If thinkers like Freud and Descartes see us as having  an essence it is our fare to live our Sarrre can be seen as diametrically  opposed ro them Atheist existential ism which I represent   stares that  if God does not exist there is at least one being in whom existence precedes  essence a being who exists before he can be defined by any concept and  that this being is man 9 Rather than possessing an essential nature that  is inescapably ours Descartes or a specific developmental scheme that  will define us Freud we are instead nothing other than what we make of   8     INTRODUCTION  WHO ARE WE   ourselves We are the projects we choose to engage in What we mean is  that a man is nothing else than a series of undertakings that he is the sum  the organization the ensemble of the relationships which make up these  undertakings 10   Sartres claim that one is nothing other than ones undertakings is insepar able from his claim that one is ones freedom They are two sides of the  same coin For someone to be a free being radically free in the sense Sartre  would have it is for them to be able to undertake any number of projects It  is for them ro choose how ro array the future that fans our in front of them  Vhen Sartre defines human beings so lely as the sum of their undertakings  what he is rejecting  and the earlier quote defining atheist existentialism  hints at this is the possibi lity that we are derermined by something outside  us most likely God It is the JudeaChristian belief that a persons being is  created in God s image that he rakes aim at For Sartre we are nor created  in Gods image We are nor created in any image XIharever there is of  image to be had in us is a product of our own creation   Sartres answer to the question of who we are seems to reject the  approach embraced by both Descartes and Freud For both of them it is  an essential nature that defines us For Sartre by contrast it is precisely the  lack of an essential nature that defines us One might argue here that Sartre  is closer to Descartes than I am indicating here After al l might Sarrres  freedom and Descartess ability to reason nor be more intimately linked  than I have indicated Indeed they might I will leave that issue aside here  since it does nor affect the claim I am about ro make The deep connection  remains intact however Just as Descartes and Freud approach the question  of who we are by means of the individual and the universal so does Sartre  For Sartre what is important about each of us we can use the term essen tial here if we do nor confuse it with the essential ism that existentialism  rejects  is our freedom Each of us is defined by our freedom And the rea son for this is precisely that freedom is the crucial universal trait of human  beings It is what makes us what we are or perhaps more appropriate what  we are not since for Sartre who was fond of paradoxes human reality  must nor be necessari ly what it is bur must be able robe what it is nor   Someone fami liar with the entire trajectory of Sartres work might well  object here that in focusing on the writings from the 1940s and early  1950s I have neglected his later more Marxistinspired work It is in the  later work where a collective determination is assimilated to the existential ism of Sartres earl ier career I want ro turn to Marx himself in a moment  This is an important issue and deserves to be paused over more than I wi ll  here I can only gesture at a response   Sartre does nor replace his existentialism with Marxism To claim that he  does would be I believe to deny the originality of his work Instead he   9     THE PHILOSOPHY Of FOUCAULT   grafts Marxism on ro exisrenrial ism showing how rhe ind ividualism of his  ea rlier work is acrually compatible wirh rhe col lect ive approach of Marx In  char way he remains com mined to rhe connivance between rhe ind ividual  and rhe universa l char is characteristic of borh Descartes and Freud On rhe  ocher side of things however rhere is a collectivist character to his Iacer  work char does bring him more nearly in al liance wirh Foucault T he rwo  thinkers never converge since Sartre always seeks universal categories  whether in his exisremialisr phase or in his Iacer Marxist one Bm seen  from rhe perspective of Sarrres Iacer writings rhey share more chan rhey do  if one focuses solely on Sartres early career   In looking ar Descartes Freud and Sarrre ar leasr Sarrres exisremial isr  period we have seen char rhese thinkers and in as much as rhey are rep resemarive the history of philosophy generally  approach rhe question of  who we are by crying ro isolate rhe imporram universal aspect or aspects of  human being and claiming char each of us instantiates char aspect or chose  aspects The approach is ar once universal and individual Is rhere anything  wrong wirh chis T here is It is nor char such views capture nothing of who  we are There is something to be said for rational selfconsciousness as an  imporram elemem of human being even if one rejects rhe idea char humans  comprise rwo differem substances There is an importam rrmh capntred in  rhe idea char we are always engaged wirh rhe world in a confl icted way  even if one abandons rhe idea char char confl ict can be traced to an Oedipal  core It seems righr ro say char freedom or something like ir is a character istic wirhom which a full concepcion of human being would be lacking  even if rhe radical freedom Sarrre posits goes beyond what one can accept   Bm there is something missing as we ll T he accoums offered ro us by  Descartes Freud Sartre and others focus on purported general defining  characteristics of human existence Bm we are nor generalities We are nor  merely individual instances of a larger human character We are specific  human beings who have specific oriemarions and who deal with specific  types of concerns in specific if distinct ways Virh these more general  accoums it feels as though we were shown a particular aspect of the human  body and to ld char that is who we are It is as though Descartes showed us  say the skeleton and said Thats you To which Freud responds No  irs nor rhe skeleton it s rhe circulatory system Sarrre in his turn says In  fact its the brain T hese answers are unsatisfying and nor simply because  each of them only captures an aspect of our corporeal srrucrure   The problem is nor simply one of a limited perspective as though if we  added up all rhe aspects of these and other thinkers together we would then  have a fu ll accoum of who we are All we would have then is an emire  human body Bm I am nor simply my body I am also rhe way it moves rhe  way ir thinks and desires I am irs rhythms I am the way it navigates   10     INTRODUCTION  WHO ARE WE   through the world In order to caprure these aspects of who I am I cannot  simply talk abom general aspects of human being And conversely neither  can I just talk abom who I am as an individual  have to talk abom the  world in which my navigating occurs a world that has a specific character  and that has unfolded its specific character in a specific way As it will rurn  om it is often the stamp of this world that in imporram ways makes me  who I am makes us who we are   At first we might say that we have to consider history Why history His tory as Foucault thinks of it is not just a maner of discrete evems or move mems that happened ro precede us Thinking of history in that way loses its  connection with us with the way it has helped make us who we are Alter natively we cannot think of history as that thing we need to understand to  ensure that we are not condemned to repeat ir In some sense that wou ld be  the opposite of Foucaults view of history To think of history as something  repeatable is ro emerrain the possibility that it has ci rcular movemems Cer ra in evems that happened before us are capable in some form of remrning  But that cant be right Could it possibly be that in the early rwemyfirst  cemury something that happened in the Renaissance could happen again  Or if we tone down the idea that something like what happened in the  Renaissance could happen again Surely similar causes have similar effects  Bm in srudying history we are as much at a loss ro isolate causes and effects  as we are in anything else What are the causes of the French Revolmion  the New Deal or global ization The idea that we repeat history even in  kind is at best an elusive one In any case there is another perhaps bener  way to approach our history   Perhaps we should think of our history as the temporal movemem that  has deposited us on these particular shores On this view history is a pan of  us It is not disconnected from us in the way the approach to history as a  series of d iscrete events would have it However if history is a pan of us if  it helps determine who we are this is not simply in virrue of its strucrure It  is not because hisrory is circular or because it takes some other shape that  we are a product of it It is because this particular history with these par t icular evems led us ro this place and not some other The history that has  brought us here could have been differem It d id not have to rake the paths  it rook If it had we ourselves wou ld be differem from who we are Bm it  rook these paths which means both that we are this rather than that and in  a lesson that will be equally impon am we are this rather than that as a  maner of contingency not necessity Ye did not have robe this rather than  that which means among other things that we do not have to cominue ro  be this   Already we can begin ro appreciate the distance that separates Foucault  from the tradition that includes Descartes Freud and Sartre For Foucaul t   11     THE PHILOSOPHY Of FOUCAULT   who we are concerns not only what human beings are at their core It is  more importantly a matter of who we are now of what we have been made  to be by the history that has formed us If we can recount that history or  since history itself is complex those histories then we can address more  adequately the question of who we are We can start to think of ourselves as  something more than generalities ie can situate ourselves and see who we  are in terms of that situation   Foucault is not the first to think of who we are as a matter of history  However he thinks of it in a new way In order to understand his view we  can approach it again by contrast Here the contrast wou ld be with Karl  Marx For thinkers of Foucaults generation the generation o f the 1960s  and 1970s Marx occupies a central place in all political and philosophica l  discussion It is hard to imagine or to remember now almost twenty years  after the fall of the Berlin wall how dominant lvlarxism was on the Euro pean pol itical landscape Bur dominant it was In France for instance there  was a Marxist parry the Parti Communiste Franflis PCF that ran candid ates for office that had a strong grip on the trade union movement and  that was the touchstone for progressive thought and action Although in the  uprisings in France in May and June of 1968 the PCF began to lose cred ibility by siding with the government in the suppression of the smdent and  worker revolts for many years before then the progressive who spoke our side the parameters defined by Marxist thought was very much an anomaly   Marx thinks of who we are as a matter of history This does not mean  that he denies that there is a human essence He does have at least in his  early writings a commitment to the idea that humans are a speciesbeing   Man is a speciesbeing not on ly because he practically and theor etically makes the species  both his own and those of other things  his object bur also  and this is simply another way of saying the  same thing because he looks upon himself as the present living  species because he looks upon himself as a universal and therefore  free being   For the early Marx this speciesbeing this being who is in its essence free  productive and selfconsti tuting is alienated from itself under capital ism  and requ ires a communist revo lution to be achieved Bur the fact that we  have this speciesbeing even in an alienated form does not mean that his tory is on ly secondary for Marx   In Marxs view who we are at a given moment is largely a matter of  where we stand in the unfo ld ing of our history Human history can be seen  as the unfolding of our productive relationship with nature and with one  another For Marx human beings are part of nature bur a part of nature  that in surviving and reproducing itself also refash ions nature It has been   12     INTRODUCTION  WHO ARE WE   sa id that Marx reduces everyth ing to economics This may be true but  Marx s view of economics is far broader than our own Economics for  him is nothing less than the social interaction with the natural world  through which we produce and reproduce ourselves We make ourselves  and one another through the production of our lives together and this pro  duction occurs as a matter of our working and reworking the material  world we find ourselves in that is nature   As it happens for most of human history this making and remaking  occurs under conditions of scarcity There is not enough for everyone to  create for themselves an adequate life People must compete for the scarce  resources that are available The resu lt is that there are some who have  more and others who have less There are as Marx puts it classes Those  who have more can and do dominate those who have less in turn those  who have less struggle against that domination The history of all hitherto  existing society he declares at the outset of The Communist Manifesto  is  the history of class struggles13   This relationship of struggle is not constant The character of classes  as well as those who make them up changes They change wi th changing  economic conditions The productive condi tions of a particular society  wi ll change until the class relationsh ips that comprise those conditions no  longer fit them Vhen that happens there will be a revo lution of some sort  and a new set of class relationships wi ll emerge This wi ll continue unti l  scarcity has been overcome For Marx the possibility of overcoming scar  city is produced by capitalism because of its enormous productive capacity  However the inequities of capita lism wi ll allow scarcity to rema in unti l the  last revolution the communist revo lution has ended all class relationships   In this view of things who we are at a particular moment is a matter of  our place in history More specifically it is a matter of our place in a par  ticular class in history We do not have to see Marx committing himself to  the idea that the entirety of who each of us is is reducible to our class posi  t ion We need not see Marx although some of h is interpreters do as a  determinist who argues that everyth ing about a person is reducible to the  class they occupy Marx once argued that Men make their own history  but they do not make it just as they please they do not make it under  circumstances chosen by themselves but under circumstances d irectly  encountered given and transmitted from the past People may not be  reducible to their histories but they cannot escape those histories either   If we are in part at least a product of our history then is there anyth ing  in particular about how our history unfolds that makes us who we are Or  is our history contingent Does it un fold without any necessary pattern or  order In Marxs eyes there is a pattern and it is a necessary one Recall  that for him class relations change when they can no longer be sustained as   13     THE PHilOSOPHY O f FOUCAULT   the economic conditions of a society evolve For instance late in the feudal  world a nascent bourgeoisie arises a class that is c haracterized nor by own ersh ip of the land bur by ownership of small facrories and large workshops  This rising bourgeoisie is excluded from positions of power and influence  which are retained by the landed aristocracy The tension between these  two classes is also and for the same reasons a tension between the struc ture of a society as it currently is wi th the aristocracy in a dominant posi tion and the relationships between a group with an increasing share of  economic resources the emerging bourgeoisie and a group that is relative  ro this group losing theirs the old aristocracy As Marx someti mes sum marizes the point there is a confl ict between the mode of production and  the relations of production When this conflict becomes roo much for a  given mode of production to bear then a revolution occurs that creates a  new one In this case feudalism gives way to capital ism   This is how history unfolds The movement accords with what Marx s  predecessor Georg Hegel calls the dialectic In Hegels view history and  nor just history ideas nature and much else unfolds d ialectically T here  is a given si tuation T hat situation is nor a stable one It is characterized  by internal tensions Eventua lly those tensions overwhelm the situation  and create another situation one that is very different and perhaps even  opposed at many points to the first situation However the second situ arion like the first is unstable it has irs own internal tensions As the second  situation unfo lds those tensions as they did in the first situation become  sharper Once again they overwhelm the situation and a new situation is  created This movement from internally unstable situation to rising ten sion to revolution to new situation is how history progresses For Hegel  as for Marx history will evenmally yield a stable situation where all the  important interna l tensions are resolved T hat will be the end of history  at least as an evolving dialectic   There are sign ificant differences between Hegels view of the dialectic of  history and Marxs First for Hegel the d ialectic is as much conceptual as  or even more so than ir is material Marx for h is parr sees the dialectic  arising on the basis of human beings material productive relations with  the natural world  Secondly Hegel believes rhar the final stage of history  arrives in the course of his lifetime that he is witnessing the last stage of  the dialectic For Marx the last stage of history needs another revolution  the communist revolution He sees Hegels thought stopping one stage  short of completion For both thinkers however there is a structure to the  way history unfolds the way it makes us who we are   This is where Foucault parts company with tvlarx In Foucaults view  ro rake history as unfolding in accordance with a necessary pattern or  structure is not to rake history seriously enough It is to submit history to   14     INTRODUCTION  WHO ARE WE   a principle outside the specific movement of irs events a principle that  dictates the nature or the direction of that movement H istory becomes sub ject to a transcendent principle outside it or an immanent principle that  determines it It is as though history does nor exist on irs own terms bur  is rather an example or an expression of something ahisrorical   Such a view of history is essentialist in the way that Sartre sees previous  views of human being as essential ist For Sartre the Genesis story of ere arion in which man is created in Gods image is essential ist In this story  man is simply an expression of an essence that he does nor create Man ex empl ifies a nature that precedes him Sartre holds that human beings create  their own natures We do nor express or exemplify pregiven ones In much  the same way a Marxist view of history is essential ist It rakes history as a  matter of expressing the movement of the dialectic History does nor pos sess irs own integrity irs existence is preceded by an essence   Yie might say that in this particu lar sense history is existential in  Foucaults eyes This does not mean that history creates itsel f in the way  that Sartre thinks human beings create themselves T hat wou ld anthropo morphize history It is nor that history creates itself it is that it is nor cre ated by some transcendent overarching or underlying princip le It does nor  necessarily progress or regress It does nor necessarily move in a circle It  does nor necessari ly repeat anything It may progress or regress or circle  or repeat Bur if it does then this is because of particular local conditions  that have arisen nor because it lies in the character of history itself to do so   History ex ists on irs own terms and must be smdied on irs own terms  T hat is what it means to say that Foucault rakes history more seriously than  others like Marx who have introduced history into their account of who  we are   Foucault addresses the question of who we are by appeal ing to history  He hopes to be able to give a richer more robust answer to that question by  abandoning both the universaVindividual approach of Descartes Freud  and Sanre and the ahisrorically determined historical approach embraced  by Marx He jettisons the first because it neglects the role that our collective  history plays in creating who we are He rejects the second because it sub mits that collective history to a determi ning principle and thus circles back  to the universal ism of the first approach Instead Foucault sees us largely as  products of a contingent history Our history has made who we are today  nor because it had ro bur just because it did because at certain junctures  it rook one path as opposed to another Perhaps it rook that path because  of the in fluence of local events or perhaps because of some mistaken  or overdetermined view of things that people had or maybe because of  chance Bur for whatever reason it did And rhus we find ourselves here as  opposed to there   15     THE PHilOSOPHY OF FOUCAULT   We are nor barred from ever gerring rhere as opposed to here Or berrer  if we are so

from the historic ally given context in which we find ourselves There are a number of theor ies that seem to want to consider us as atoms as ind ividuals separable from  our specific context For instance the individual ism of traditional liberal  political theory seems to see us rhus Indeed liberal po litical theory has  been attacked by a movement called communitarianism for allegedly neg lecting our embedded ness in specific contexts Although Foucault is no com munitarian he rends to view those specific contexts with a more jaundiced  eye than do communitarians  he ratifies the idea that who we are is not  separable from them   We need not turn to political theory however to see the individualism  Foucault rejects It is all around us It lies in the notion dear to many  Americans that one can be whoever one likes as long as one is willing to  work at it To be sure this notion has irs virtues For instance it offers opti mism in the face of obstacles However it is strictly speaking mistaken on  two counts First it assumes that each of us is an iso lated individual that  our past and our future are not collective but individual matters Secondly  and related it assumes that the conditions in which each of us finds our selves are not deeply a part of who we are that each of us can shrug off our  historically given social inheri tance and assume another This is certainly  wrong I for instance wi ll always be someone who grew up in New York  during the Vietnam War period My peregrinations no matter how far they  lead me geographically or emotionally or chronologically from that rime  and place wi ll always be informed by the legacy of being raised in that city  during that period Who I am will always be at least in parr a matter of that  past This is the second characteristic of Fouculrs histories   It is tied to the first one that who I am is a lso inseparable from who other  people are After all I was not the only person who grew up in New York at  that rime There were others Some of them I have remained in contact  with and others I have met later in life The recognition is always immedi ate There are things that we share an outlook that we can if not embrace  then certainly relate to one that is foreign to many others I have met Who  I am then is a collective matter not simply an individual one And irs tie to  who I am runs deep   For Fouculr this collective matter is common not only to a very specific  rime and place It involves much wider themes larger cu ltural orientations  that for him operate across Europe and sometimes the estern world as  well as across a number of practices These themes are also of longer stand ing often centuries in duration The idea remains however that who each  one of us is cannot be separated from a common his tory that has created the  landscape we inhabit Commonality inseparabiliry two themes fram ing  the histories of who we are that Foucault recounts   17     THE PHilOSOPHY O f FOUCAULT   Bur someone will say you are not solely a person who grew up in New  York during the Vietnam War You are more than that your historical de termination is more complicated It comprises multiple sources that arise  from vastly different arenas of experience You spent years working in the  field of psychology at least until you starred reading Foucaults histories of  psychology you are engaged in child rearing you teach at a university  you are a serious runner you have organized on behalf of various progres sive causes Surely the collective histories of these d ifferent practices are  also determinative for who you are You are not simply the resu lt of being  an ado lescent in New York during the late 1960s and early 1970s   This is true It makes the histories of each of us complex It also makes  the histories of our particular contexts complex There are norms of child  rearing of university teaching of running of progressive organizing T hese  norms and the practices in which they are embedded sometimes overlap  and sometimes confl ict They are neither entirely liso lared from one another  nor reducible to a single theme that binds them In order to study the emer gence of each of them we have to look close to the ground A general his tory of our rimes wi ll not do Worse still a history that focused on what the  leaders of the time  those anointed by the med ia the electoral political  structure or by themselves  would be entirely irrelevant Ve must look  where people live at the practices that they engage in or that one way or  another come to engage them Over the course of his life Foucault says  many things about his method often from different angles and often sh ift ing depending on his current interests One of the most important and  enduring however is this   In this piece of research Discipline and Punish as in my earlier  work the targec of analysis wasnt institut ions theories or  ideology but practices   It is a question of analyzing a regime  of practices  practices being understood here as places where  what is said and what is done ru les imposed and reasons given the  planned and the taken for granted meet and interconnect   QM 75   Practices are what people live T hey determine who we are not by impos ing a set of constraints from above but through historical ly given norms  through which we think and act T hese historical ly given norms are once  again neither divorceable from nor reducible to what people often con sider their larger historical context The insistence of psychology in so  many business and educational practices embedded in the larger concern  with normality that is an ongoing theme of Foucaults research cannot be  separated from the emergence and domination of capita lism Bur neither is   18     INTRODUCTION  WHO ARE WE   it reducible to capitalism in the way that many Marxists would have it as a  superstructure that is simply erected upon the economic base It is a prac tice or a group of practices that interact with other practices both eco nomic and noneconomic and that share or borrow or crossfertilize or  reinforce important themes all in complex ways   The convergence conflict and reinforcement of practices can create  effects that are unintended by those who participate in them For instance  as we wil l see in detail below those who are members of monasteries in  the early eighteenth century and before do not intend their rigid daily  schedules to be part of the larger social development of what Foucault calls  discipline a term he uses to cover the minute observation and regimenta t ion of daily life under the banner of normaliry Monks of the t ime in their  isolation do not foresee that their practices will intersect with those of the  Prussian mi litary or the prison reformers in order to foster the rise of norm ality as a crucial form of the operation of power in our world However  since practices intersect with one another in various ways even the relative  isolation of monks cannot prevent the incorporarion of their regimented  life into other practices whose convergence gives way to disciplinary con trol Foucault puts the point this way People know what they do they  frequently know why they do what they do but what they don t know is  what what they do does   If practices are engaged with one another in this way then one can begin  to understand the contingency of history particularly in regard to its deter mination of who we are The complexiry of interacting practices does not  lend itself to a single overarching theme To see what is at play in our his torical inheritance cannot be a matter of finding the key to unlock the mys teries of its workings it must be a matter of looking at the unfold ing the  evolution and the interaction of particular practices In discovering who we  are there is no privileged place to look as some Marxists would like to  look at the economy There is no privileged theme to discover as some  theorists wou ld like to discover progress or d ialectics or circular recur rence There are only the particularities of what has come before struc tured by the various practices in which we are all engaged   This is not to deny that the contingency of history may give rise to im portant themes themes that run across large swaths of a specific historical  context Foucault often seeks to understand such themes as discipl ine  normalization biopolitics or in his earl ier work resemblance classifica t ion and death seen as a natural development of lite What it denies is that  these themes structure the unfo ld ing of history from above within or out side it These themes emerge from the unfolding of practices Once in  place they may for a time react back on those practices to give them fu r ther strucntre But it is not because the themes have an independence from   19     THE PHILOSOPHY Of FOUCAULT   our practices that they do so it is precisely because they are inseparable  from them   One of the aspects and for Foucault one of the most important aspects  of this inseparability of themes from practices concerns knowledge  Although there are many shifts in Foucaults approach to history over the  course of his career  changing from what has been called archaeology to  genealogy to ethics discovering the importance o f power turning from the  ex ternal consrimrion of who we are to our own selfconsrimrion  the pre occupation with knowledge remains a constant with him For Foucault  knowledge is something that always happens in our practices One does nor  know something from a standpoint outside the practices that make one  up There is as the phi losopher Thomas Nagell puts it no view from  nowhere  Our knowledge is situated in our practices This simaring has  several implications   First our knowledge changes as our practices change In the unfolding of  our contingent history we will know things in different ways depending on  the stare and structure of our practices at a particular rime To pur the po int  another way we will know differently at d ifferent periods This does nor  mean that nothing we know is ever true or that knowledge is mere ly a  shifting opinion If Foucaults perspective is right then one cannot claim  that nothing we ever know is true or that knowledge is merely a shift ing  opinion Both of those views would presume that we can somehow exit our  practices and with them our knowledge to obtain a view above or outside  them in short a view from nowhere Bur that is precisely what Foucaults  perspective precludes   A second implication of the embeddedness of our knowledge in our prac tices is that what goes on in those practices wi ll affect how we go abou t the  project of knowing Our knowing is nor on ly inseparable from our prac tices generally it is inseparable from the norms and doings and sayings  those practices consist in This idea becomes important in Foucaults  genealogical works where the theme of power emerges as a central concern  of his thought If knowledge occurs within our pacrices and power arises  within those same practices then there must be an intimate connection  between knowledge and power In contrast to those who would like to see  knowledge as something that happens apart from the impurity of power  relat ionships knowledge and power are entwined Perhaps Foucault  wntes   we should abandon a whole tradition that allows us to imagine that  knowledge can exist only where power relations are suspended    These powerknowledge relations are to be analysed therefore  nor on the basis of a subject of knowledge wl1o is or is nor free in   20     INTRODUCTION  WHO ARE WE   relation ro rhe power sysrem bur on rhe conrrary rhe subject who  knows rhe objects to be known

it is difficult to imagine how being otherwise  can be accompl ished without others One does nor create new practices on  ones own One does nor alter the practices one participates in without  it having effects on others One does nor understand ones own complex  history without recourse to the work of those who have also attempted to  understand theirs If who we are is a collective project then so is the project  of being otherwise than who we are   What is certain is that the project of being orhenvise is nor  inaccessible  We do nor have to be who we are currently constituted to be And in that  sense we might refine the question that frames Foucaults work Rather  than asking  Vho are we we might see Foucault asking the question  Who are we tiOll Although much of his historical work describes a tra jectory that precedes us he often ends his books by drawing lessons for the  character of our current ways of being It is nor that the question of who we  are is the wrong one it is rather that the question of who we are asked  righ tly is the same as the question of who we are now If we turn away  from timeless or inescapable answers to the question of who we are then  unless we rake as our task a mere historical curiosity about who we once  were the po int of our doing history the goal of our research is to under stand who we are now   In an essay on the philosopher Immanuel Kant Foucault makes this  clear Responding roan essay of Kants entitled What is Enlightenment  Foucault writes that what modernity offers us and what much of the crit ical project of modernity has been is a reflection on who we have been  made to be and how we might escape the consrrants of that making   The critical ontology of ourselves must be considered nor cer tainly as a theory a doctrine nor even as a permanent body of  knowledge that is accumulating it must be conceived as an atti tude an ethos a ph ilosophical life in which the critique of what we  are is at one and the same rime the historical analysis of the limits  imposed on us and an experiment with the possibility of going  beyond them WE 319   Kants text is a reflection on the Enlightenment written by someone who  is living through it It is an attempt to grasp to understand the present as it  is happen ing T hat in Foucault s view is a striking fearure of the modern  era and a legacy of the En ligh tenment it promotes a critical relation to  ones present Foucaul t writes   The thread which may connect us with the Enlightenment is  nor fai thfulness to doctrinal elements bur rather the permanent   22     INTRODUCTION  WHO ARE WE   reactivation of an artimde  rhat is of a philosophical ethos rhar  could be described as a permanent critique of our historical era   Ibid 312   Foucault rakes himself like Kant robe inscribed in rhar ethos Foucault is  not antimodern nor is he postmodern He is at least in his own eyes pre cisely modern He seeks to understand the presenr and who we have been  made to be in that present nor to satisfy a passing curiosity burro open up  the possibility for new ways of being   Foucault never does tell us aside from offering a few suggestive phrases  what these new ways of being should consist in That is our task rhe task of  each of us alone and many of us together His rask consists in asking about  our present asking who we have come to be in rhe present Bur the task  is not an idle one Rather this task requires work on our limits that is a  patient labor giving form ro our impatience for liberty ibid 3 19 It is  directed ar once towards our present and towards our future Ir is ar once  a historical analysis and an invi tation to change It is at once the project of a  single individual alone in a dusty archive immersed in faded documents  and of those who engage in conversation with rhe works rhar emerge from  that immersion and yer again of those who having read him or heard of  his work or anticipated his words with their own lives would converge on a  project of selfunderstanding and selftransformation that can use rhe mater ial of who we are in order ro create new possibilities for who we might be   Near the end of his life Foucault puts the point this way   As for what motivated me ir is quite simple I wou ld hope that in  the eyes of some it might be sufficient in itself ft was curiosity rhe  only kind of curiosity in any case that is worth acting upon with a  degree of obstinacy not the curiosity that seeks ro assimilate what  it is proper for one to know bur that which enables one to get free  of oneself UP 8   Vith Foucault we must ask who we are who we are now We must follow  the thread of this question in his texts and rhe responses always partial  that he gives Bur this path will in the end prove useless unless there is rhe  passion for who we might be Foucault does nor provide rhar He can reveal  the contingency of who we have been told that we are bur he cannot  inflame rhe des ire to be otherwise That must come if indeed it does come  from those whose own lives are at stake   23     CHAPTER TWO   Archaeological histories of  who we are   How might we embark on a historical approach or a set of historica l ap proaches to address the question of who we are Because of the complex ity  of our historical inheritance there are many avenues of entry No single one  among of them is preferred or exhaustive There is no Archimedean point  Foucault himself at different rimes in his life offers d ifferent interpreta tions of his own approach Usually those interpretations de pend on what is  motivating him at the time he rends to see his previous writings in ligh t o f  current interests There is however a traditional classification of his pub lished writings into th ree periods archaeology genealogy and ethics The  first period encompasses the time from his first major publication Histoire  de Ia folie a age classique partially translated into Engl ish as lvfadness and  Civilization through his last methodological work on archaeology The  Archaeology of Knowledge The other major works o f that period are The  Birth of the Clinic and The Order ofThings The second period is character ized by rwo major works Discipline and Punish and the first volume of The  History of Sexuality The final period encompasses his last two published  volumes of the history of sexual ity The Use of Pleasure and The Care of the  Self If we are to give dares to these periods we might say that the archaeo logical period runs from 1961 unril1968 or 1969 the genealogical period  unti l 1978 or so and the ethical period until his death in 1984   How usefu l is this periodizari on Although it is the standard one many  have argued that the divisions in Foucaults approach are far less decisive  than it wou ld seem to suggest If Foucault sees continuiry in his own work  even if that continuity differs in character depending on the d ifferent stages  of his career should we nor also see his writings as forming a more or less  continuous who le Or if we rake Foucault seriously in those moments  where he seems to say that each o f his texts is a singular experiment should  we nor jettison periodizarion from the other end Should we nor argue  against periodizarion precisely because there is nothing li ke a continuous   24     ARCHAEOLOGICAL HISTORIES OF WHO WE ARE   whole characterizing his works nor even an important continuity between  any one and irs successor   There are reasons ro embrace any of these readings of his corpus Ye  wi ll at least roughly fol low periodization here although along the way I  wi ll point our reasons to be leery of it There wi ll be reasons to see the con t inuity and reasons to see the singularity of each work Ye cnnor treat all  of his works here without betraying the riches that each brings we wi ll  focus on those most often discussed And even so betrayal will be inevitable   Throughout our readings however there will be a single theme that  returns one that characterizes the entire trajectory of Foucaults publica t ions What all these periods have in common is that they are framed by a  historical concern with the emergence of who we are   The history of madness   The history of madness in Histoire de Ia folie is h is first major work It is  the firsr work where he speaks in his own voice the voice that will be recog nized over the course of the rest of his career Before the book on madness  and in keeping with the intellectual tenor of the time in Europe Foucault  writes under the convergent influences of phenomenology and Marxism In  an interview he speaks of this ea rly period   we should nor forget that throughout the period from 1945 ro  1955 in France the entire French university  the young French  university as opposed to what had been the trad itional university   was very much preoccupied with the task of building some thing which was nor FreudianMarxist bur HusserlianMarxist  the phenomenologyMarxism relation That is what was at stake  in the debates and efforts of a whole series of people Maurice  MerleauPonry and Sarrre in moving from phenomenology ro  Marxism were definitely operating on that axis CTIH 21   Histoire de Ia folie breaks decisively with the early project Phenomeno logy rakes a persons subjective experience to be the crucial object of invest igation It seeks to understand the structure of a person s experience to  unfo ld that which although experienced needs to be reflected upon in a  r igorously descriptive way if it is to become accessible to the understanding  Foucaults book on madness rejects phenomenology It sh ifts the ground  from the project of unpacking and derail ing an experience that has nor yet   25     THE PHilOSOPHY O f FOUCAULT   been fully clarified to a historical investigation of the different structures for  treating madness It is those structures that frame the subjective experience   Rather than asking as the phenomenologists d id  What is it like to  experience suchandsuch Foucault asks instead What are the shift ing  historical frameworks within which suchandsuch  in this case madness is experienced  The investigat ion no longer concerns what the ind ividual  undergoes it concerns the historical conditions of their undergoing it  If  we use terms loosely we might say that the axis of investigation has shifted  from inside the individual to outside   In order to grasp these shifting historical frameworks we cannot rake  madness as an objective given It is not that there is this disease or this struc ture or this way of being called madness that has been experienced d iffer en tly in different historical periods Why should we assume that beneath the  frameworks within which madness is t reated there is some constant that  informs them all This wou ld assume roo much Alternative ly we need not  assume the opposite that there is nothing that any of these frameworks is  looking at that they are all preoccupied with an illusion Rather we should  make no assumptions about the object of study and treatment called mad ness Yie should look at the historical frameworks for what they are and  more important for what they reveal to us about ourselves rather than for  what they may or may not reveal about the object of their investigation   In order to do this Foucault suggests that we return to the point at wh ich  madness becomes distingu ished from reason We must try to return in  history to that zero po int in the course of madness at which madness is an  undifferentiated experience a not yet divided experience of division itself  MC ix T he experience of madness emerges from a historical contex t in  which madness first appears as such as an experience distinct from reason  Foucault begins his investigation just before that context in order to trace  irs development   In the Middle Ages he writes madness does not have a distinct charac ter or at least it does not have the character we have come to ascribe to it  as the O ther of reason Instances of what we would call madness are woven  more seamless ly into the fabric of medieval experience As the Middle Ages  come to a close however the figure of madness begins to appear Soon the  mad wi ll rake the place both figuratively and literally of the medieval  leper The houses of leprosy will be cleared They will at least in parr be  replaced by the madhouses As lepers were once rl1e object of practices and  rituals of exclusion hidden at the edges of medieval life in lazar houses  now the mad will occupy their place It will be the same gesture in any case  exclusion and confinement   In what gu ise do the mad begin to make their appearance  that is their  appearance as mad Foucault answers this question by appeal to the   26     ARCHAEOLOGICAL HISTORIES OF WHO WE ARE   arresting image of the Ship of Fools Ships of Fools were said to be ships  that towns filled with their mad sending them off on uncerta in journeys  but at least ridding the towns of their presence Why however would their  presence constintte a threat In the late medievan and early Renaissance  period madness comes to be associated with mysterious nether regions It  is associated with animality with darkness and ultimately wi th death   The dawn of madness on the horizon of the Renaissance is first per ceptible in the decay of Gothic symbolism as i f that world whose  network of spiritual meanings was so closeknit had begun to un ravel showing faces whose meaning was no longer clear except in  the forms o f madness MC 18   In the disintegration of the medieval perspective madness appears as the  indecipherable symbol of hidden truths It is the dark underside of exist ence that can neither be escaped nor understood As such it is an object of  both fascination and repulsion   In Foucaults eyes it is no accident that two of the major authors of the  time Cervantes and Shakespeare often give madness pride of place in their  works For Cervantes the figure of Don Quixote constitutes a madness that  is at once fool ish and wise but in any case possessed of an unsenling power  In Shakespeares plays one need only refer to the madness of Hamlet or the  twisted truths of King Lears fool to recognize the importance he accorded  the mad experience   The Ship o f Fools encapsulates this combination of fascination of repu l sion On the one hand the ships are objects of painting o f discussion and  of public policy On the other their purpose is to depart to leave and to let  human kind alone Do these ships actua lly exist Foucault says they did  Other historians are sceptical Later after recounting Foucaults own his tory of madness we wi ll need to return to the question of the historical  status of his account Is his account accurate and what effect might particu lar inaccuracies have upon it For the moment these questions can be placed  to the side   What is clear is that the ambiguous status enjoyed by madness during the  late medieval and early Renaissance period decl ines and by the seventeenth  century madness is no longer the figure of darkness or of death There is  a historical break Madness becomes more pedesnian It is not a stalking  ani mal within each of us nor is it a sign of impending d isintegration it  becomes mere folly During the Renaissance madness was at times also  conceived as fo lly but not as mere folly   Madness is here at the heart o f things and o f men an iron ic sign  that misplaces the true guideposts between the real and the   27     THE PHILOSOPHY Of FOUCAULT   chimerical barely retaining the memory of the great tragic threats   a life more disturbed than disturbing an absurd agitation in soci ety rhe mobility of reason MC 37   One can glimpse this change in the rrearmenr o f madness in Descartess  Meditations Recall rhe movemenr of doubt rhar is Descartess method of  philosophical reflection In order ro arrive at what must necessarily be t rue  what cannot be suspect and whar therefore can serve as the foundation  of the rest of our knowledge one must doubt everything that cannot be  held certain The senses are doubted Mathematical knowledge is doubted  Descartes even raises the possibility of an Evi l Genius rhar systematically  deceives him and clouds his thought What is nor enrerrained what cannot  reasonably be enrerrained is the possibility rhar one is mad   When doubting rhe senses Descartes raises rhe possibi lity rhar one is  mad only ro dismiss ir and then approach the issue from another direction  rhar one is asleep As for madness he writes   how could I deny rhar these hands and this body are mine un less  I am ro compare myself with certain lunati cs whose brain is so  troubled and befogged by the black vapors of the bile rhar they  conrinual ly affirm rhar they are kings whi le they are paupers   or  rhar their body is glass Bur this is ridicu lous such men are fools  and I would be no less insane than they if I followed their example   The problem rhar madness raises may be a true p roblem One can reason ably doubt the evidence of the senses including the ev idence one has of the  character of ones own body After all in dreams we experience at rimes the  disintegration of our bodys character and capacities   If the problem of doubt can be susta ined by sleep however it cannot by  way of madness Madness is outside the pale because it is outside the prov ince of truth As Foucault writes   In the economy of doubt there is a fundamenral disequ ilibrium  between madness folie on the one hand and dream or error on  rhe other Their situation is d ifferenr in their re lationship ro rrurh  and ro what is being sought dreams or illusions are surmounred in  the structure itse lf of truth bur madness is excluded by the subject  who doubts HFAC 57   Dreams and il lusions can place our beliefs in doubt because they still inhabit  rhe realm of rhe true and rhe false Ve can rhink about them consider  them hold them before the light of rrurh and the shadow of fa lsity In a   28     ARCHAEOLOGICAL HISTORIES OF WHO WE ARE   word they are subject to reason Madness is nor Jr is beyond or perhaps  beneath the structure of truth If man can always be fooled thought as  exercise of the sovereignty of a subject that is obl iged to perceive the truth  cannot be insane HFAC 58   Whence this change in attitude towards madness How did madness lose  irs fascination How did it fall from its initial status as symbol of our darker  regions to a subject unworthy of the project of thought Foucault does not  say During this period of his thought he focuses more emphatically than  he does later on the discontinuities between historical periods As he ex plains later in his methodological study The Archaeology of Knowledge   the great problem presented by such historical analyses is not how  continuities are established  the problem is no longer one of tra dition of tracing a line but one of division of limits it is no longer  one of lasting foundations but one of transformations that serve as  new foundations the rebuilding of foundations AKDL 5   We shall return to this idea later but it is worth recognizing one of the  motivations for his emphasis on discontinuity It is to prevent us from  thinking that we can hold our history and indeed ourselves clearly before  us If thought has ruptures if it has breaks then it is not on a continuous  path of progress toward the Truth Yie can no longer think that one day we  wi ll know ourselves that nothing will escape our intellectual gaze The pro gressive view of history that view of history that cells us we are on a path  that leads inevitably closer to the truth of things is a temptation that must  be fought Introducing discontinuities into history is one way to do ir  because it stymies the attempt to see each histor ical period as a further  development or refinement of the previous one   There is for Foucault always an Other or O thers to our thought Or to  pur the point another way though t can always be otherwise than it is  There is always more to think than our current categories would lead us to  believe This should nor be surprising for a writer whose first major work  approaches madness as the Other of reason   Returning then ro Descartess dismissal of madness Foucault sees in it  not a singu lar event and nor as we just saw a cause of a new way of treat ing madness Descartes is nor the initiator of a new approach ro madness  His dismissal of madness is itself a reflection of a larger shift in the relation  between reason and madness It is emblematic rather than initiating There  is at this time however another greater emblem of the change in reasons  relation to madness Foucault marks the date of this change as 1656 fifteen  years after the publication of Descartess Meditations That year sees the  decree that establ ishes in Paris the Hopiral General The Hopiral General is   29     THE PHILOSOPHY Of FOUCAULT   hardly the only large insrimrion of confinement in France lr certainly is nor  the first In addition ro o lder established hospitals there are the abandoned  lazar houses that will soon be housing the mad What makes this particular  institution unique is something else  the Hopi tal General is nor a medical  establishment It is rather a sort of semijudicial structure an administrative  entity which along with the already constituted powers and ou tside of  the courts decides judges and executes MC 40 W ithin a few months of  the establishment of this sem ij udicial srrucmre Foucault says nearly one  per cent of the population of Paris finds itself confined ro one hospital or  another   Is one per cent ofrhe population mad Does the decree of 1656 allow the  pol ice authoriti es to diagnose Descartess fools on every street corner in  Paris and elsewhere since as Foucault makes clear the Grear Confinement  is nor limited ro Paris or even ro France No lr is not a question simply of  round ing up the mad Rather there is a more general sensibility in which  madness finds itself caught up   Between labor and idleness 111 the classical world ran a line of  demarcation that replaced the exclusion of leprosy The asylum  was substituted for the lazar house in the geography of haunted  places as in the landscape of the moral universe The old rites of  excommunication were revived bur in the world of production  and commerce Ibid 57   It is work as an economic and moral matter that structures the rise of the  Great Confinement Those who can work are morally worthy those who  cannot are to be excluded   We must be careful here nor ro see a false h istorical continuity rhar  Foucault seems robe suggesting It may appear rhar there is a historical con stant a role of exclusion or excommunication that must be played by  somebody Earlier iris leprosy that plays rhar ro le later it is madness and  the refusal or inability to work This seems to me to be a misreading of  Foucaults intent T he rhetoric is indeed suggestive bur I rake it as linle  more than that There is an earlier exclusion and a later one They share  similar r intals and even some overlapping sites But that is all There is no  universal or absolute need for exclusion that is p layed our now upon one  parr of the population and later upon another Rather there are various  inclusions and exclusions that occur in given socia l and historical contexts  Foucault is fo llowing a particular one recognizing at the same rime that ir is  not the only one   In any case reasons view of madness during the period of the Grear  Confinement occurs through the lens of work madness was perceived   30     ARCHAEOLOGICAL HISTORIES OF WHO WE ARE   through a condemnation of idleness and in a social immanence guarameed  by the community of labor ibid 58 Madness is parr of a larger phenom enon that Foucault labels unreason The person of reason is engaged in  work He more likely than she in this historical period is parr of the  community of labouring beings that rakes his sense of himself from that  engagemem To labour is nor simply an economic maner It is also and  more deep ly a moral one As Foucault notes the cheap labour provided by  the houses of confinemem does not yield much economic value In fact by  competing with work omside those houses it may do more economic dam age than good Bm prosperity is nor the issue here One works nor in order  to comribme a certain amoum to the greater social wealth  one works  because it is the righ t thing to do People of reason labour To refuse to  labour is to be a creamre of unreason And to be a creamre of unreason is  to invite exclusion from the community at once moral and geographical  of those who recognize and engage in the work that is a persons calling   Madness then is swept up in the larger phenomenon of unreason It  does however occupy a d istinctive place that of animality The mad per son is one who has descended or regressed imo an an imal stare That is  why Foucault says although in most cases unreason the refusal to work  is hidden during this period madness is allowed robe displayed Madness  is an object lesson 1 shows how far human beings can descend imo unrea son from the state of madness If reason is distinct b oth from unreason and  from an imal ity then the madman exhibits the link between the lan er rwo  clearly and in doing so shows by comrasr what ir is to be fully human   The view of madness as animal ity is in keep ing with Descartess own  theoretical exclusion of madness If for Descartes madness is the inability  to engage in reason for the emirery of what Foucault terms the classical  period roughly the midd letolate sevemeenth to the end of the eigh r eemh cemury madness is treated as a particular form of general unreason  a descem imo bestiality that cannot share in what makes us who we are Ve  are far removed here from the madness of the earlly Renaissance There is  nothing mystical or threatening abom the mad nothing to give one pause  over the fragility of ones ex istence or the powers that threaten it The an i mal in man no longer has any value as the sign of a Beyond it has become  his madness wirhom relation to anything bm itse lf his madness in the state  of namre ibid 74   We must be careful here nor to imerprer the fall imo the state of namre in  terms of a framework closer to our own We are used to seeing in the an i mal the absence of free will To descend imo nature is to be caught up in  determinism Ve are the story goes an imals ourselves bm animals that  however one accounts for it possess a free will that allows us to recognize  and to extricate ourselves from the immediacy of our circumstances We   31     THE PHILOSOPHY Of FOUCAULT   are nor like a wasp or a squirrel that is bound to its instincts reduced to irs  hardwiring Vhen we think of the descent into animality that is how we  are tempted to rhink of it   This would be a mistake It is nor on this horizon of nature that the sev enteenth and eighteenth centuries recognized madness bur against a back ground of Unreason madness did nor d isclose a mechan ism bur revealed a  liberty raging in the monstrous forms of animal it ibid 83 Madness in  the classical period does nor harbour a determinism instead it harbours a  licentious freedom a freedom that cannot be harnessed to the requirements  of reason It is this reason in turn that is the recogn ition of the constrain ing requ irements of a civil ized society and above all the requ irement of  VOrk   Treatments of madness then although they may seem to our eyes to be  crude forms of medical intervention should not be interpreted in this way  Madness is nor yet mental illness it is nor yet to be submi tted to the medical  model At this extreme point madness was less than ever linked to the  domain of correction Unchained animality could be mastered only by dis cipline and brutalizing ibid 75 Madness is u ltimately a moral matter  and must be treated as such Madness wi ll be treated and Foucault details a  number of the treatments that madness receives from immersion in water  to the administration of bitters and to travel However that treatment  rema ins caught in the ethical web that the classical period weaves around  its view of the mad Being both error and sin madness is simultaneously  impurity and sol itude it is withdrawn from the world and from truth bur  it is by rhat very fact imprisoned in evi l ibid 17 5   In the second half of the eighteenth century th ings change aga in A new  orientation toward madness arises one that sets the stage for our more con temporary view Ve are not yet at the inauguration of the contemporary  view that will have to await the interventions of Samuel Tuke and Philippe  Pinel However a couple of the themes that will soon receive their full  articulation in the work of these two emerge before their appearance on  the stage of madness In the second half of the eighteenth century the unity  of unreason begins to unravel Poverty comes ro be distingu ished from  madness nor only in the latters character as pure l ibertine animality bur in  the association of madness now with indolence rather than impoverish ment During the latter half of the eighteenth century it is the rich rather  than the poor who are at risk of madness   How does the link berween poverty and unreason come undone Here  Foucault offers a causal explanation rather than as usual simply demarcat ing a break In the economic change from mercanti lism to industrial ism  there arises a need for unskilled labour Mercanti lism rel ies on trade  and smallscale production Industrialism requires a large labour pool   32     ARCHAEOLOGICAL HISTORIES OF WHO WE ARE   Therefore confin ing those who are able to perform unskil led labour in the  name of unreason begins ro run coumer to rhe emerging economic impera tives In rhe mercamile economy rhe Pauper being neither producer nor  consumer had no place idle vagabond unemployed he belonged only to  confinemem  With rhe nascem industry which needs manpower he  once again plays a parr in rhe body of rhe narion ibid 230   We musr be careful in approach ing chis sh ift of concern abour madness  from poor ro rich since ir remains a sh ifr on more or less rhe same ground  Madness is sri II tied ro rhe absence of work Bur rhe absence of work is no  longer ried ro impoverishment ir finds new moorings among rhe idle rich   The release from work brings wirh ir an unbournd leisure one that can  loosen a persons ties to the world of reason and work For Foucault this  new view of madness can be located particularly in three themes the asso ciation of madness with excess wealth the bond posited between madness  and an immodest religious fervour and a concern that arises around too  much read ing and speculation These are preoccupations of the rich It is  those who do not have to labour char have an excess of wealth ir is they  who are ready ro embrace new religious fads and ir is they who have rhe  rime for reading and speculation All of these occur ar rhe expense of a  labour that keeps ones feet on rhe ground chat prevems one from drift ing off imo the ethereal realm where madness lies ready ro weave irs spell   This shift is accompanied by a general withdrawal from rhe project of  confinemem The poor being creatures of unreason could be confined in  large numbers wirhour harm to society Now they musr be reintegrated  They are not to be replaced by rhe rich even rhough rhey have become  objects of the fear of madness As we noted before Foucault does nor  believe rhar rhere must always be an exiled or confined group Confinemem  is nor a historical constant rhat is foisted upon differem groups ar differ em rimes With rhe rise of the industrial economy rhe fracturing of rhe  uniry of unreason and in France ar least the humanist pretensions of  rhe French Revolution confinemem irself begins to lose irs grip as a cure  for social ills   lr is in rhe wake of chis loss of confinements grip rhar Tuke and Pinels  project at rhe end of rhe eighteenth cemury of rhe  liberation of rhe mad  is able ro take place Before turning to their work it is worth pausing a  momem over rheir historical repurarion Tuke and Pinel are canonized in  rhe history of psychology and psychiatry for breaking rhe chains  often  lireral ones  of confinement rhat umil their time are the lor of rhe rhose  deemed mad It is they who recogn ize the brural iry of confinemem and  heroically step in to end ir and to create newer more humane methods  of treating madness Modern psychotherapy often traces irs lineage back to  these figures who it is claimed are the first to imervene on behalf of rhose   33     THE PHILOSOPHY Of FOUCAULT   who are mentally ill rather than against them The establishment of Tukes  Quaker Retreat in England and Pinels order to remove the chains of those  confined at the hospital at Bicerre together form the moment at which mod ern psychiatry is born They mark the moment of the birth of the hospi tal as  asylum as a space o f cure in contrast to the previous age of hospitals as  places marked solely by their role as institutions of confinement   There are three questions one might pose ro this account First does  the work of these two figures by their own efforts destroy the idea that  confinement is the proper way to treat madness As we have seen it does  nor Confinement comes into disrepute before rhe end of the eighteenth  century T heir work although contributing ro irs demise does nor by itself  create it The historical break has already taken place before Pinel arrives at  the door of Bicetre in 1793   Secondly what are we to make of the brutality exhibited toward the  mad From our perspective the confinement of the mad is undoubtedly  barbarous We should bear in mind however rhar this barbarity is nor in tended to be so It is not anger or a desire for vengeance or mere cruelty that  motivates the confinement of the mad in the seventeenth and eighteenth  cenntries It is the entire organization of the re lation between reason and  madness Given the view of madness as a type of unreason rooted in a liber tine an imal ity confinement makes a certain kind of sense The fact that it  does so does nor exonerate it It is nor that confinement is or has ever been  a good thing just because people once felt they had reason to confine any  more than US slavery wou ld be justified by the fac t that Europeans believed  Africans to be inferior T he point rather is the historical one that what Tuke  and Pinel intervene upon is nor an intended brutality but the remnants of a  way of looking at madness   If the brutality of the class ical period toward the mad is unrecogn ized as  such this can lead one to ask whether there is an unrecognized brutal ity in  the treatment of the mad in our age This is the third question the most  important and most unsettling one We look upon the treatment of mad ness in the classical period and see an unremitting crue lty in their confine ment That we do so is as we just saw half right Bur why do we miss the  other half Because we believe ourselves to be enligh tened  both morally  and scientifically  about madness in ways that our predecessors are nor  However do nor those in the classical period see themselves as enl ight ened Their thought is nor inco herent and gven the framework that  Foucault depicts their theories about and actions towards what they rake  to be madness are neither arbitrary nor baseless Is it possible that we be cause we see history as progressive and in particullar as progressing towards  where we now stand are blind to our own barbarities towards what was  once called madness and is now called mental il lness   34     ARCHAEOLOGICAL HISTORIES OF WHO WE ARE   It is chis d ismrbing possibility char Foucault pursues in his chaprer on  Tuke and Pinel Whar he discovers is something orher rhan rhe srory rhat  has been handed down ro us abour rhe heroism of rheir actions Tuke and  Pinel do nor liberate madness from irs chains rarher rhey change rhe com position of rhose chains From rhen on ir is nor iron rhar would bind rhose  declared mad Their bonds wi ll be less obvious bur more pervasive Instead  of rhe physical bonds of confinemem henceforth rhere wi ll be rhe moral  bonds of shame and gu ilr   Consider rhis passage quored in Madness and CivilizAtion regarding one  of rhe firsr of rhe mad whose chains Pinel removes Pinel orders rhar in  regard ro rhis man who bel ieved he was Chrisr   everyone  nor add ress a word ro rhis poor madman T his pro hibition which was rigorously observed produced upon rhis self inroxicared creature an effecr much more perceptible rhan irons  and rhe dungeon he felr

Nor  rhe freedom from bondage bur instead rhe subm ission ro a more secure  bondage Foucault describes rhe shifr characterized by Tuke and Pinels  methods one rhar focuses on mora l rarher rhan physica l consrraim In  addition ro silence rhese methods include infamilizarion religious incu lca t ion verbal confronration and an endless judgemem on rhe madmans  behaviour Finally in a move rhar remains wirh us inracr afrer rwo hundred  years there is rhe elevation of the srarus of rhe docror whar Foucault calls   rhe apotheosis of rhe medical personage ibid 269 This elevation ar  once creates a nearly unshakeable rrusr in rhe docror and in rhe same ges rure lends an aura of rhe sacred ro rhe docrorpariem relationship   I can recall rhe power of this apotheosis from my own experience Vhen  I was younger I worked in a memal hospita l Although rhe nursing sraff  spem many more hours ralking wirh and listen ing ro rhe pariems when  doctors came to imerview a pariem rhey

even earned much grumbling among rhe nursing sraff  Even roday rhere are few people who visir psychiatrists who do nor feel  rhar rhey are in rhe hands of someone wirh almosr shamanistic power   35     THE PHilOSOPHY O f FOUCAULT   The new approach to madness that the work ofT uke and Pinel embodies  does nor heal the rift rhar arises in the late Renaissance between the mad  and the sane There is no more commerce between those who are isolated  as mad and those who sir in judgemenT on them than there is when unrea son is segregated and confined The science of menral disease as ir wou ld  develop in the asy lum wou ld always be only of the order of observat ion  and classification It wou ld nor be a dialogue ibid 250 This is nor ro  claim that physical bondage is better than the moral rrearmenrs that remain  in force today Although here one might as k what the role of the recenr  dominance of pharmacological approaches to madness might play does  this represenr another historical break in the perspective on and rrearmenr  of madness It is rather ro stake our three positions First it is a misnomer  to speak of the liberation of the mad A shift in consrrainrs is misdescribed  by the term liberation Secondly this sh ift does nor heal the rifr between  what is called madness and what is called sanity The rifr in the conver sation between madness and reason rhar Foucault describes emerging  through the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries is a legacy that we have  nor yet escaped As Foucault says The language of psychiatry which is  a monologue of reason abo11t madness has been established only on the  basis of such a silence ibid x xi   Finally all this can be understood only if we abandon the view of history  as a movement of progress History is nor of its nature progressive it does  nor necessari ly move from the more primitive co the more enl ightened  from the barbaric to the civi lized History has neither telos  a goal  nor  a structured movemenr We can see this clearly if we abandon our com mitment ro historical conrinuiry and allow ourselves ro see breaks instead  moments in which one way of looking is replaced by another not as an  improvement on or a refinement of the earlier way bur simply as a new  framework or perspective   What do we make of Foucaults history of madness It is an early work  one about which Foucault periodically expresses reservations However  one can ask abour the character of its larger project What does this history  seek ro do What is irs point For the phi losopher Jacques Derrida Histoire  de Ia folie is a grand attempt that is by the nature of its project a necessary  fa ilure In Derridas view Foucault has attempted  and this is the greatest  merit bur also the unfeasibiliry of the book ro write a history of madness  itself 3 Foucault tries in this book to heal the rift that rhe classical age has  created He seeks ro pur madness back in d ialogue with reason ro restore  the voice of madness that reason s monologue has suppressed   This Derrida argues is a project rhar cannot succeed One cannot speak  in the name of madness wirhour speaking as the mad do Otherwise one   36     ARCHAEOLOGICAL HISTORIES OF WHO WE ARE   speaks for them in the language of reason One continues the monologue  rather than establ ishing a dialogue   ls nor an archaeology even of silence a logic rhar is an organ ized language a project an order a sentence a syntax a work   Nothing with in this language and no one among those who  speak ir can escape the historical guilt if there is one and if ir is  historical in a classical sense  which Foucault apparen tly wants to  pur on trial Bur such a trial may be impossible for by the simple  fact of their articulation the proceedings and the verd ict unceas ingly reiterate the crime   The charge levelled against Foucault here is one that has come to be  clled a performarive contradiction Foucault betrays in act what he claims  ro want in theory In Derridas eyes this is the inescapable fare of Fou cault s project One cnnor construct an archaeology rhar seeks ro restore  the voice of madness An archaeology must be arricu lared in a systematic  fashion It must be a project of reason Therefore it cnnor bring us any  nearer ro the mystic bur irrational sense of mad speech rhar madness has  in the early Renaissance and even less so to the rime in which madness is  nor d ifferentiated as a particular experience   Is this in fact what Foucault is after in his discussion of madness Derrida  relies on a quote from the preface to the book one that follows the citation  above that the language of psychiatry which is a monologue of reason  about madness has been established only on the basis of such a silence  The rexr continues I have nor tried to write the history of that language  bur rather the archaeology of rhar silence MC xi This seems to Derrida  ro imply rhar what is at issue is a discussion nor from the standpoint of  reason bur from rhar of those who have been named mad by reason and  then silenced   However we need nor interpret rhe passage this way As Derrida points  our the project such an interpretation calls for would be an impossible one  Moreover it does nor seem to be in keeping with the rest of the book  which is indeed a history of how the mad have been categorized as such  discussed and treated Perhaps it would be better to turn things around  Rather than interpreting the book in ligh t of this suggestive bur nor entirely  clear passage it would be best to interpret this passage on the basis o f the  book that follows it In order to do that we should pause over the passages  term archaeology   Foucaults methodological reflection The Archaeology of Knowledge  appears in 1969 eight years after the first edition of Histoire de Ia folie  As   37     THE PHILOSOPHY Of FOUCAULT   Foucault notes in the latter book the methodology he attempts to construct  there is not meant to be a faithful reflection of what goes on in the earlier  books T he books he refers to are Histoire de Ia Folie the book on medicine  The Birth of the Clinic and the book we shall discuss shortly The Order of  Things In French ririe of the last book isLes Mots et les chases which in  English means Words and Things The Archaeology of Knowledge does nor  simply reconstruct a common methodology employed in the earl ier works  This in any case would be fruitless since their approaches although  broadly simi lar differ somewhat from book to book Instead Foucault  seeks to articulate a methodology that those books are to a greater or lesser  ex tent attempts to ach ieve Nevertheless much o f the broad framework he  offers there does capture what is going on in the earlier works   In the conclusion to The Archaeology of Knowledge Foucault sums up his  ea rlier projects this way   The posiriviries I have tried to establ ish must nor be understood as  a set of determinations imposed from the outside on the thought  of individuals or inhabiting them from the inside in advance as  it were they constitute rather the set of conditions in accordance  with which a practice is exercised in accordance wi th which that  practice gives rise to partially or totally new statements and in  accordance with which it can be modified AKDL 208 9   Vhar Foucault has in mind here is a very precise approach to history one  that resists the idea of continuities and the idea rlu t the historical structure  of knowledge in a given practice or group of practices during a given period  can be changed by the conscious efforts of individuals to change it for  example Tuke and Pinel    For Foucault there are certain regu larities that govern what can and  cannot legitimately be sa id in particular practices at particular rimes It is  nor that it is impossible to say certain things The I imitation is nor a physical  or a legal one It is rather episremic rhar is it has to do with knowledge  If certain unacceptable things are said or if things are said that might be  acceptable if uttered by the right authorities bur nor by this particular  person they will simply nor be recognized It would be li ke a spectators  getting up in a courtroom to declare an accused person either innocent or  gui lty Such a gesntre wou ld nor be recognized ln fact the person would  probably be though t mad   These regularities function as rules of a sort Bur they are nor conscious  ru les dictating what can be said They are nor recognized as limitations by  the speakers who are bound by them In addition these regu larities do nor  channel speech into particular claims they allow for the possibility of   38     ARCHAEOLOGICAL HISTORIES OF WHO WE ARE   debate and contradiction Instead they are unconscious strucrurings of dis course setting the character and boundaries of how debate and discussion  can happen A couple of years later in the English preface to The Order  of Things Foucault famously refers to these strucrurings as  the pos itive  unconscious of knowledge OT xi  T hese strucrnrings are not principles  dictated by the outside transcending the practice itse lf and then imposed  on it Bur neither are they a set of boundaries and conditions agreed upon  by the participants T hey are the framework the perspective by means of  which 1 the participants in d iscussion recognize one another in their  proper role as participants and 2 the statements of those participants are  recogn ized as contributions to a particular discussion or as establish ing  certain points or as making certain claims or as performing certain acts   Foucault introduces the term archive and says chat the archive defines  a particular level that of a practice that causes a multiplicity of statements  to emerge as so many regu lar events as so many things to be dealt with  and manipulated AKDL 1305 On that basis he defines an archaeo logy  Archaeology describes discourses as practices specified in the element of  the arch ive ibid 131 Here we can see the elusive idea Foucault is trying  to capture In cont rast to a view of history as continuous or progressive  archaeo logy takes history to involve particular scructurings of what can  and cannot legi timately be said as well as how and by whom they can  legitimately be said dur ing certain periods or at least in certain groups  of practices during those periods a point to which we shall return   Those st rucrurings can and do change W hen they change this is not  because of an improvement in knowledge or through the efforts of an  individual although those things can contribute to a change Foucault as  we saw earlier does not say much abou t why they change Bur because  knowledge is structured in this way however the change happens it con stitutes a break or a r ift with the previous strucruri ng   If we interpret Foucaults archaeology of si lence in this way then  Histoire de Ia folie does not appear to be what Derrida says it seeks to be  There is no such thing as an archaeology of si lence if by that we mean a  historical account of what is suppressed of what is not allowed to express  itself T he book on madness is not a book about madness It is a book about  reason about reason s monologue on madness Uhat Histoire de Ia folie  seeks is not to give vo ice to those who have been labelled mad as Derrida  points our no archaeology can do thar Rather it articulates the various  ways in which once madness is established as such the discourse on mad ness is structured The account of these structurings happens in three suc cessive stages the Renaissance the classica l period  and the early modern  period The focus however is on the classical period   If we see things this way the history we have su mmarized makes more   39     THE PHilOSOPHY OF FOUCAULT   sense and is more coherent T he book is an archaeology of the historical  srructurings the arch ives of reason in irs monologue upon madness   What then do we make of the phrase the archaeo logy of that silence  It is nor an archaeo logy of a silence itself bur rather an archaeology of a  silencing of the forms it has taken the successive structures of the discus sions it has el icited the practices of experimentation and treatment to  which it has given rise To pur the po int another way it is nor an archaeo logy of the mad it is an archaeology of us the ones who are caught up in  reason    Histoire de Ia folie is a discussion of who we are It focuses on one of the  most important aspects of our being our reason It discusses the way in  which reason has established then maintained the esrablislunent of irs  Other that which lies outside it that against wh ich it defines and defends  itself Moreover it suggests that reason is to be thought of as something  other than a timeless human quality Far from being the essential core of  who we are as philosophers from at least Descartes up to the present day  have thought reason is a mutating historical project It rakes different  forms at d ifferent rimes In much of the classical period for instance rea son is aligned with a certain morality a morality that was itself allied with  labour Reason Foucault suggests is bound to several conditions from  which it has a lways distanced itself history everyday practices and its  Other Reason is neither timeless nor ethereal It is instead temporal and  grounded in our world One might say of it what Foucault later says about  truth during an interview   Truth is a thing of this world it is produced only by virtue of mul tiple forms of constraint    Each society has irs general pol itics  of truth that is the types of d iscourse which it accepts and makes  function as true the mechanisms and instances which enable one  to distinguish t rue and fa lse statements the means by which each is  sanctioned    TP 131   The lesson of Histoire de Ia folie does nor concern those who have been  called mad at least nor directly It concerns those of us who have nor fallen  under that label It is contrary ro Derridas read ing a coherent discussion  of who we have been and of who we have become and it is addressed to  those who are capable of both understanding that discussion and recogniz ing themselves in it T he book leaves us at the th reshold of our particular  structuring of reason It offers witness to irs historical birth and allows us  to see the origin from which it came   Bur is it accurate Are the facts that Foucault brings forward in the book   40     ARCHAEOLOGICAL HISTORIES OF WHO WE ARE   acmal facts Do the facts point in the direction Foucault suggests There  has been some historical assessment of Foucaul ts works al though those  who read Foucault philosophically and those who read him historically are  unformnarely rarely in dialogue with each other My own orientation is  ph ilosophica l so I can offer little in the way of historical judgement of his  work However this is an area that should not be ignored Some historians  have found his work compelling6 Others have criticized it from a view point that seems foreign to his projects offering claims of fact that seem to  oppose his perspective bur do nor or claims that are irre levant to his per spective Sti ll others have quibbled with some of his claims bur found his  overall perspective intrigu ing   In order at least to get a sense of the historica l debate about Foucaults  work we can focus on an article that is particularly critical of Foucaults  history It illustrates both what kinds of critique might be relevant and what  might be less so An article by the historian H C Midelforr7 takes issue  with a number of historical claims Foucault offers Among his historical  criticisms we can isolate four of them for discussion   First Midelforr claims that contrary to Foucaults assumption there is  no record of such a thing as a Ship of Fools There are references to depor tat ion and exi le of mad persons to be sure   Occasionally the mad were  indeed sent away on boats Bur nowhere can one find reference to real boats  loaded wi th mad pilgrims searching for their lost reason Secondly the  grand renfermement Great Confinement was aimed not at madness or  even at deviance bur at poverty9 Moreover this confinement is moti vated nor by a new srrucmre of reason bur by an ecclesiastical tradition  of long standing that banished the poor T hirdly for the mad at least the  period of confinement does not end with the emergence of a new view of  the relation of reason to madness In fact it is only recently that the use of  large institutions for the insane has come under criticism Virh regard to  madness therefore we are witnessing the end of the age of confinement  on ly now as drug therapy and communi ty mental health centers increase  in popularity at the expense of inpatient hospitals Finally Foucaults  history is insensitive to differences across Europe He privileges the French  experience at the expense of other countries that have treated the mad very  differently from France Related to this Foucault neglects the internal his tory of France There is roo much diversity in any g iven period to reduce it  all to a particular structuring especially one of reason   The first criticism is an example of an irrelevant fact Foucault does  indeed claim that there were Ships of Fools sent away by towns in search of  their reason However nothing hangs on the fact that there were not  There were works of art depicting Ships of Fools and those considered   41     THE PHILOSOPHY Of FOUCAULT   mad were indeed sent away as Midelforr says and often on boars  W har Foucault is interested in is rhe rise of a certain fascination wirh  madness The existence of beliefs and arr abou t Ships of Fools regardless  of rhe real existence of such ships has no bearing on rhe emergence of rhis  fascination   The second criticism rhar ir is poverry rarher than madness rhar motiv ates rhe Grear Confinement is one rhar Foucault largely agrees wirh  He  points our as we saw rhe link between reason moral ity and work More over he rraces rhe decline in confinement ro a d ifferent view of poverry  Midelforr might insist here rhar be rhar as ir may ir is ecclesiastical tradi tion rarher rhan a change in rhe character of reason rhar morivares rhe con finement Bur rhar raises rhe question of why ir happens ar rhis particular  moment rarher rhan earlier If there is no change in rhe way people see  things why do rhe aurhoriries sudden ly starr confining large numbers of  their fel low citizens Although Foucault does nor offer a causal history  of events rhar led ro rhe Grear Confinement he does offer a view of how  people saw things such rhar confinement begins ro make sense ar rhar rime  when ir would nor have earlier Ascribing confinement ro a longstanding  ecclesiastica l tradition does nor explain rhis   The rhird criticism is an important although perhaps nor critical one Ir  raises rhe question of rhe relation of physical confinemenr ro rhe moral con straints exempl ified in rhe work of Tuke and Pinel Foucault d ifferentiates  we have seen between confinement as a general marrer and rhe rise of rhe  asylum However ir may well be rhar rhere is a more complex relationship  between physical and mora l confinemenr rhan Foucault admirs This would  nor derracr from his general claims abour reason and madness bur would  require a more nuanced view of rhe relation of physical and men tal bonds  rhan rhe one he has offered   The mosr urgent issue is rhe fina l one First Foucault ofren privi leges  France in his histories T his raises rhe question of how far one can general ize his conclusions beyond rhe French archive Midelfort refers to rhe work  of psychiatrist and historian Klaus Doerner enrirled in rhe English rrans larion Madmen and the Bourgeoisie A Social History of Insanity and  Psychiatry as a positive alternative ro Foucaulrs history of madness In  rhar work Doerner divides his history into rhree parts dealing wirh Eng land France and rhen Germany He finds both simi lari ties and differences  among these countries bur discusses each on rhe basis of irs own experi ence Oddly although M idelfort sees Doerners work as an alternative to  Foucaults Doerner himself does nor see ir rhar way He rakes issue wirh  some of Foucaults interpretations largely becau se as he acknowledges  his approach is more straightforwardly dialectica l rhan Foucaulrs bur he   42     ARCHAEOLOGICAL HISTORIES OF WHO WE ARE   accepts many of Foucaults claims without reservation Moreover he refers  to Foucaults book as the first important approach to a scientifi c sociology  of psych iarry 11   Doerners praise notwithstanding the question of the relevance of  Foucaults privileging of France for the experience of other countries is an  important one It is a question that concerns more t han historical accuracy  If as Foucault believes we are largely products o f a contingent history  then we can look nowhere else than at the particularities of that history in  order to understand who we have become Foucault knows this And to  understand ourselves arigh t we must understand how far a historical por trait drawn from a particular place can be generalized We cannot appeal to  some universal essence that lies within ourselves or our history in order to  give an account of who we are in general and especially of who we are  now There is nowhere else to turn bur to what has happened Of course  how we understand what has happened our mode o f approach to ourselves  and our history is also crucial Although this book is philosophical in ori entation the question of general izabiliry as well as that of historical accur acy should always be with us We shall return to both in the discussion of  the book on the prisons   In addition to the question of how far Foucaults histories can be gen eralized across Europe there is also the quest ion of interna l diversiry  Foucaults early histories those grouped in what is called his archaeo logical  period have been read as positing themes that characterize an entire  period In contrast to the later genealogical works wh ich focus more se lf consciously on particular areas of experience his archaeologies are often  understood as claiming that the themes he discusses rhe strucrurings he  cites app ly nor only to the specific areas under srudy bur across an entire  culture as well as across an entire continent Nor all of his interpreters  embrace this view 12 bur it is a common one and Foucault admits later that  it is a view that could easi ly be ascribed to his work   It is nor difficult to see how such a view could arise in regard to the book  on madness There he discusses reason as though it were a monolithic  thing covering a large swath of who we are When reason changes we  change Foucault does not say this He does not say that who we are is a  matter of reason Nor does he say that reason is always the same across a  particular culture at a particular rime However in the way that he focuses  on reason in the way he situates his discussion relative to thinkers  like Descartes in the way he creates a division between reason and irs Other   madness  he creates the impression that what holds for reason in the  particulars in which he discusses it holds for other aspects of who we were  and are   43     THE PHILOSOPHY OF FOUCAULT   Words and things   If Histoire de Ia folie leaves rhis impression The Order ofThings reinforces  ir In rhar book Foucault introduces rhe concept of rhe episteme a concept  rhar founds rhe books approach He defines his project rhis way   what I am anempring ro bring ro light is rhe epistemological field  rhe episteme in which knowledge envisaged a parr from all cri teria  hav ing reference to irs rational value or ro irs objective forms  grounds irs posiriviry and thereby manifests a history which is nor  rhar of irs growing perfection bm rather rhar of irs conditions of  possibility in this account what should appear are those configu rations within rhe space of knowledge which have given rise to rhe  diverse forms of empirical science   on the archaeological level  we see rhar rhe system of posiriviries was transformed in a whole sale fashion ar rhe end of rhe eighteenth and beginning of rhe nine teenth cenmry OT xxi i   This view of an episteme is we see ar once in keeping wirh rhe general  methodological approach Foucault describes in The Archaeology of Know ledge published three years later Although rhe larrer book does nor use rhe  rerm episteme rhe rerm archive plays a similar role In any case ar issue is  looking ar rhe posiriviries of our knowledge nor by means of an account  of rhe progress of knowledge bur rather by means of rhe srrucmrings rhar  in a given historical period form irs conditions of possibility The issue is  nor so much what is said or bener rhe rrmh of or evidence for what is said  bur rather how what is said arises from what can be said or at least legirim arely said ar a particular rime and place   Foucault sees rhis project as related to rhe book on madness bur also  different in important ways   The history of madness would be the history of rhe Orher of rhat  which for a given culmre is ar once interior and foreign therefore  to be excluded so as to exorcize rhe inrerior danger bm by being  shm away in order ro reduce irs otherness whereas rhe history of  rhe order imposed on things would be rhe his tory of rhe Same of  rhar which for a given culmre is both dispersed and related there fore to be distinguished by kinds and to be collected rogerher inro  idenriries OT xxiv   There are ar least three things worth drawing attention to in this passage  First rhe history of rhe Other he speaks of rhe archaeology of a silence is   44     ARCHAEOLOGICAL HISTORIES OF WHO WE ARE   referred to contrary to Derridas interpretation from the side of reason It  is how reason sees its Other not how the Other is in itself that the book on  madness addresses Secondly and this is the main point of the passage  whereas the book on madness defines reason by means of the foil it creates  for itself the current book seeks to define something not by what it opposes  but by what it is or by how it works That is why Foucault uses in this book  and the methodological one the term posi tivity The structurings he dis cusses are not limits They do not stop knowledge or claims of knowledge  from occurring They are posi tive srructurings they create the space in  which knowledge happens   Thirdly the passage speaks in a very general way about culture By  invoking the concept of the episteme Foucault seems to indicate  and this  passage reinforces it that he is addressing an epistemological structuring  that operates across all forms of knowledge in a cu lture or at least all  empirical sciences In The Archaeology of Knowledge he admits that this  would be a reasonable interpretation of the text writing that in The Order  of Things the absence of methodological signposts may have given the  impression that my analyses were being conducred in terms of cu ltural  totality AKDL 16 It is an interpretation that when the English trans lation appears in 1970 Foucaul t is at pains to distance himself from He  writes in the preface to the English translation that the book was to be not  an analysis of Classicism in general nor a search for a Weltanschauung  worldview but a strictly regional  study OT x   On the one hand in the original text it is difficu lt to see the various  epistemes he discusses as something other than arch ival layers that stretch  across the map of knowledge during particular periods On the other how ever aside from his general methodological claims he focuses his discussion  on three specific areas of knowledge those that have more recently come to  be cal led economics biology and linguistics He finds similar srrucrurings of  knowledge running across these fields and moreover similar changes in  srrucrurings during d ifferent rime periods   As with the book on madness the discussion unfolds in three stages  Foucault begins a little later with Renaissance though t then spends the  central parr of the book on the classical period and finally ntrns towards  more recent developments His treatment of the Renaissance does not  distinguish the three fields that are to become his concern with the excep t ion of an account of language that he appends to rhe end of the discussion  of the general episteme This also can contribu re to the idea that the  srructurings he discusses later are relevant for other fields of knowledge  aside from the three he focuses on Renaissance knowledge he finds can  be summed up in the idea of resemblance There are re lations of resemb lance among different elements and aspects of the universe The project of   45     THE PHilOSOPHY Of FOUCAULT   knowledge is to d iscover those relations Th is project cannot be carried our  through the use of empirical methods of discovery since resemblances  are an invisible aspect of the cosmos that is woven into it rather than some thing one can discover through observation or experimentation To discover  resemblances one needs to interpret the cosmos rather than to perceive it   To get a grasp of how resemblance structures knowledge one can appeal  to the example o f the microcosm and macrocosm The idea of microcosmic  and macrocosmic resemblances stretches at least as far back as Plato In  the Republic Plato offers what is one of the mosr lasting examples of their  relation in the history of ph ilosophy Socrates is seeking to discover what  justice in the soul is The chal lenge he confronts is that it might be difficult  to see justice at the level of the soul it might be elusive or undetectable He  offers his interlocutors the possibility of looking at something larger than  the soul in order to be able to see justice more dearly   Since we arent clever people we should adopt the method of  investigation that wed use if lacking keen eyesight we were told  to read small letters from a distance and then noticed that the same  letters existed elsewhere in a larger size and on a larger surfaceu   The larger object Socrates suggests is that of a ciry and so they design a just  city in order to allow justice to appear more perspicuously   The just ciry as it turns our is a harmony of three elements the mer chants who work to make money the guardians who protect the city  and the rulers drawn from among the guardians who rule the city This  harmony is reflected in the soul The merchants are like the souls desires  seeking satisfaction They form the appetitive parr of the soul The rulers  are like the souls reason guiding the soul along irs proper paths That is  the souls rational parr And the guard ians are rbe souls spiri t The spirit  is that which if it is nor corrupted by the a ppetites aligns itself wi th the  souls reason in order to keep one noble or honourable   In this example there are several salient aspecls First the discovery o f  justice as a harmony of parts o f the soul does nor arise through empirical  research bur rather through an exercise of analogy It is nor observed it  is instead recogn ized through a reflective enquiry Secondly the analogy  works from the larger to the smaller and back again as though the cosmos  is constructed so that cities and souls reflect each other There are invisible  bonds of resemblance that suffuse the cosmos the project of knowledge  is to understand them Finally although the brief summary here does nor  show this the work of interpretation that this analogy requires does nor  rely on anyth ing obvious that either the city or soul presents to Socrates  or his fellow knowledge seekers T hat it was the three classes of the ciry   46     ARCHAEOLOGICAL HISTORIES OF WHO WE ARE   that were the relevant factor in d iscovering justice is a maner of patient  theoretical construction and subtle reasoning It does not presem itself as  immediate or obvious Further finding their analogy in the soul requ ires  more reflection and interpretation T he project of drawing om resemb lances then is not a simple matter of seeing them It requires patiem imel lecmal work   The patience of this work becomes particularly evidem when one realizes  that resemblances can occur in a variety of ways Foucault isolates four  of them convenientia aemulatio analogy and sympathy Convenientia  occurs through proximity the soul is proximate ro the body and so each  is built ro resemble the other Aemulatio Foucault says is convenietia bm  withom spatial proximity it is resemblance at a d istance Analogy allows  for resemblances that occur by thematic likenesses between more disparate  objects Sympathy is a freefloating resemblance that suffuses the cosmos  These forms of resemblance form the framework within which the Renais sances epistemic project takes place   In this framework language functions as a participam rather than as an  external elemem The operation of language like other things is woven  into the fabric of resemblances that constitute the universe It is a namral  part of the cosmos The relation of languages to t he world is one of ana logy rather than signification or rather their value as signs and their dupl i cating function are superimposed they speak the heaven and the earth of  which they are the image OT 37 The langu age that articu lates the  world is also of the order of the world they are inseparable in the Renais sance episteme   And when they do become separated when the working of language is  no longer of a piece with the cosmos the Renaissance episteme has given  way to the classical one If Renaissance knowledge can be summed up in the  idea of resemblance then the classica l period receives its summation in the  word order Order is a matter not of analogy bm of representation If we  are to understand classical order we must approach it by way of language  as a representing medium   Representation begins when the re lation between the sign and what it  signifies is no longer a namral one  In the sevemeenth and eighteemh cen ntries the peculiar existence and anciem solidity of language as a thing  inscribed in the fabric of the world were dissolved in the functioning of rep resentation all language had value only as discourse ibid 43 There are  objects on the one side and the signs that represent them on the other Their  imernal bond is sundered In saying this however one must be careful It is  not that language has withdrawn from its place in the universe to become  something else something other Rather it is that the relation between  signs and their signification has lost its status as a namral one For instance   47     THE PHILOSOPHY Of FOUCAULT   Foucault says a sign can become an object for another sign a linguistic sign  can become the object of a representation T he issue then is between signs  and what they signify nor between language and the rest of the world We  might say that the change is a matter of lingu istic operation rather than  ontological status   What is the relation between signifier and whar it signifies in the classical  period The sign effaces itse lf before the object it signifies and in turn the  object reveals itself without remainder in the sign   The signifying element has no content no function and no deter mination other than what it represents it is entirely ordered upon  and transparent to it Bur this content is indicated only in a repre sentation that posits itself as such and that which it signifies resides  without residuum and wi thout opacity with in the representation  of the sign Ibid 64   The relation between sign ifier and signified is exhausted in the relation of  representation T here is no longer as there was in the Renaissance a silent  web of resemblance that would constitute the aerher in which signs and  their objects are immersed And there is nor yer as there will be later a  human consciousness that must be taken into account because of irs effect  on the operation of language T here is no third thing the relation is a bin ary one   It migh t seem here that representation does nor break the relationship  between words and things There seems to be an internal bond After all if  signs efface themselves before their objects is that nor because of some  deep tie berween sign and object Does nor representation without remain der imply that there is a bond between signifier and sign ified   Foucault is nor argu ing that there is no relation between a sign and irs  object We are nor yet in more recent views of language that see language as  a social phenomenon imposed on nature from without What no longer  ex ists in the classical period is a web of resemblances in which language firs  The internal bond that is lost is the aether of resemblance the cosmic play  of convenientia aemulatio analogy and sympathy rhar binds all of exist ence together It is that bond that is broken wi th t he emergence of classical  representation   If the primitive source of knowledge is that of representations then the  project of knowledge becomes that of ordering those representations We  should think of the term order nor as an overarch ing Order in which every thing has irs place bur rather as a project of ordering that is at the heart of  classical knowledge Our signs are no longer texts with hidden meanings to  be deciphered they are now representations that must be put in a proper   48     ARCHAEOLOGICAL HISTORIES OF WHO WE ARE   order so rhar understanding can occur One starts w ith the simple ones and  then bui lds more and more complex systems of representations Thus the  idea of the table the table that gives the proper order to things becomes  central ro the classical episteme   The sciences carry within themselves the project however remote  it may be of an exhaustive ordering of the world they are always  directed roo toward the discovery of simple elements and their  progressive combination and at their center they form a table on  which knowledge is d isplayed in a system contemporary with itself   Ibid 74   We must be clear here W hat Foucault is descrubing is nor the position  taken by various sciences  especially those concerning livings beings  money and value and grammar Order is nor what these sciences claim  Nor is he characterizing what they see themselves as engaged in  Order is  nor the project itself it is the framework the structuring of the project  Virhin this structuring many debates rake place T he structure of order  allows for opposition and cont radiction What it does nor allow for are  claims and positions that cannot be fitted within the context of order It  requ ires an ordering of representations into their proper tables   To see the project of order at work consider the emergence of natural  history Foucault points out that natural history is nor the same thing as  biology T he latter is concerned with the concept of life the former with  the concept of living beings Living beings need nor be brought under the  sway of a single concept unless there is already a commitment to that con cept underlying the episremic project Natural history does not have that  concept W hat ir has is a project of ordering   Ordering in contrast ro the episteme of the Renaissance starts with  observation We observe a plenitude of living beings in the world There is  no necessary hierarchy of order no Order rhar is presented ro us The  project of ordering lies in utilizing observation so as to ach ieve order Lan guage will be the lynchpin since representation allows objects to be given  to us as they are   Natural history has as a condition of irs possibiliry the common  affinity of things and language wi th representation but it exists as a  task only in so far as things and language happen ro be separate It  must therefore reduce this distance between them so as to br ing  language as close as possible to the observing gaze and the things  observed as close as possible to words Natural history is nothing  more than nomination of the visible Ibid  132   49     THE PHilOSOPHY Of FOUCAULT   For narural history the visible is the privileged means of access to the  observable It is the visible that can reduce the distance between things and  their terms more than the other senses However this reduction is only the  first step Nomination if it stays at the level of simple naming is nor  enough There is representation bur nor yet order The nomination of  natural history must create order among the d iversity of narure and the  names that represent it Nomination must create a srrucrure It does so by  means of   four variables only the form of the elements the quantity of  those elements the manner in which they are distributed in space  in relation to each other and the relative magnitude of each  element    For example when one srudi es the reproductive  organs of a plant it is sufficient bur ind ispensable to enumerate  the stamens and pisti l or to record their absence accord ing to  the case to define the form they assume accord ing to what geo metrical figure they are distributed in the flower circle hexagon  triangle and what their size is in relation ro o ther organs   Ibid 134   First then one starts with simple representations in this case the ele ments then one observes and records how those elements are combined in  terms of quantity spatial relation and relative magn itude And our of these  combinations one bui lds rabies T hose rabies show the place of each living  being relative to its neighbours One creates a taxonomy In this sense  one botanizes living beings As Foucault tells us The book becomes the  herbarium of living structures ibid 135   How are these rabies created This is the subject of much debate within  natural history during the classical period One approach would be to select  what seem to be the central elements and arrange the taxonomy around  them This of course can be accomplished in numerous ways depending  on the elements one selects at the outset  Another approach would be to  starr with an exhaustive description of a particular living being and then  move to the next one listing only the differences between it and the first  one and so on Here one does nor begin wirh a relatively arbitrary choice  of privileged elements bur with an arbitrarily chosen living being T hese  approaches are exclusive one cannot use both at the same rime However  they are both projects framed by the ordering characteristic of the classical  episteme   In the course of bui lding a taxonomy language itself undergoes reflec tion  As things are brought into a systematic relation with one another  so are the terms that represent them And because of this there is a close   50     ARCHAEOLOGICAL HISTORIES OF WHO WE ARE   relationship between narural history and language perhaps closer in a sense  than between narura l history and irs successor field  bio logy   ie must therefore nor connect narural history as ir was mani fested during the Classical period with a philosophy of life albeit  an obscure and still faltering one In reality ir is interwoven with a  theory of words   ir decomposes the language o f everyday life  bur in order ro recompose ir and discover what has made ir  possible   ir cri ticizes ir bur in order ro reveal irs foundation   Ibid 161   Near rhe beginning of rhe nineteenth cenrury rlhe classical episteme un dergoes an upheaval lr is one rhar wi ll induce episremic changes changes in  rhe srrucrure of rhe archive rhar frames rhe investigations of narural history  the theories of money and value and genera l grammar and perhaps the  entirery of Western knowledge depending on how generally one reads rhe  claims Foucault advances Narural history will become biology the theor ies of money and value will become economics and general grammar wi ll  become linguistics The change rhar occurs might be characterized as rhe  addition of a new depth or dimension to the world of knowledge   To see this new dimension we can rurn ro rhe emergence of biology Bio logy unlike narural history is concerned with life lr is nor an investigation  simply of living beings rhar are robe ordered bur of rhe organic nature rhar  underlies them This new investigation was to be based on a principle alien  to rhe domain of rhe visible  an internal principle nor reducible to rhe  reciprocal interaction of represemarions This porinciple which corres ponds to labor in rhe economic sphere is organic structure ibid  227  Li fe in biology labour in economics hidden grammatical structure in lin guistics these are the new concepts around which the project of knowledge  is to be undertaken   lr is nor simply rhar new concepts however important have been added  to rhe lexicon of rhe classical episteme These concepts do more than just  broaden an episremic srrucrure that is already in pol ace Instead they form  rhe pivot around which rhe entire srrucrure changes Once rhe depth of  an underlying reality is brought into the framework of knowledge the  goal of ordering and rhe assumption of representation are lost Ordering is  lost because ir is in thrall to the visible One orders the visible one brings  what can be seen and what can be said of what is seen closer together  However the depth introduced by the nineteenth century is nor of the  order of rhe visible bur rather that of an underlying srrucrure or narure To  investigate that is nor merely ro add a dimension to ordering rather iris to  abandon it   51     THE PHilOSOPHY O f FOUCAULT   Representation is lost because of the assumption that words and things  recall the French ririe of the book Les Mots et les chases no longer march  up as cleanly as the classical age thought they did Now there are elusive  depths and dimensions that undergird the visiblle and irs representation  One can no longer count on the effacing of the sign before the object or  the abil iry of the sign to render the object without remainder In fact it is  precisely the remainder that is of interest   This slackening of the bonds of representation corresponds to rwo spaces  of depth one on the side of the sign or the observer the other on the side of  the object For both human beings and the worlld they confront there is  more to be understood than presen ted itself in t he classical period This  more is nor that of the Renaissance with irs resemblances folded into the  cosmos It is instead the more of an elusive depth that always lies beyond  ones abil iry to grasp it conceptual ly   Those who have studied Kant will recogn ize this dual depth Foucault  characterizes It is the depth of the noumenon both on the side of the  object to be known and the subject who acts In fact Foucault comments  that the empirical studies of biology economics and linguistics are the  other side of the same epistemic framework rhar harbours transcendental  philosophy For the former   the conditions of possibiliry of experience are being sought in the  conditions of possibiliry of the object and irs existence whereas in  transcendental reflection the conditions of the possibility of the  objects of experience are identified with the conditions of possibil iry of experience itself The new posi tivity of the sciences of life  language and economics is in correspondence with the founding  of a transcendental phi losophy Ibid 244   Although as Foucault notes the character of t ranscendental philosophy  will change radica lly in the new episteme from that of Kantian phi lo sophy the introduction of depth can be gl impsed in the example of his  philosophy   This new episteme which Foucault thinks we are near the end of at  least arrhe rime of publication 1966 is characterized by a particular insrab il iry T he instabi lity can be grasped in the preceding quote There is an  oscillation in this episteme between the empirical and the transcendental  each forming although insufficiently the epistemic ground of the other  Because of the hidden depth on both sides of rhe equation neither the  empirical sciences nor transcendental ph ilosophy can complete their tasks  of grounding their knowledge The empirical sciences cannot do this  because the depth they seek is nor reducible to empirical methods they   52     ARCHAEOLOGICAL HISTORIES OF WHO WE ARE   must appeal to transcendental phi losophy Alternatively transcendental  ph ilosophy is a sefreflecrion on a self that always ultimately eludes the  reflection There is more depth than can be grasped by reflectors them selves rhus there is a constant appeal outside transcendental philosophy ro  the empirical sciences   This oscillation appears in four gu ises The first Foucault calls the ana lyric of finitude The person engaged in reflection or investigation is finite  in character and in knowledge As such finitude becomes both the object  of investigation in the arising human sciences of b iology economics and  linguistics and the limitation on knowledge of the investigation itself  since it is a human being who is doing the investigating The second guise  is the empiricotranscendental doublet in which human being man as  Foucault calls it is at once the ground and object of investigation The third  guise is the cogito and the unthought in which thinkers keep seeking  the unthought grounding of their own thought which in turns recedes  further toward the horizon as they pursue it Finally there is  rhe retreat  and return of origin It is an endless search for an origin that must be there  because it is founding but cannot be grasped precisely because it is found ing it founds the search that is seeking it 14   The underlying commonal ity among these four g uises is a kind of depth  that performs three roles at once First it is constitutive of our approach to  the question of who we are Secondly it is the object of investigation Since  representation can no longer be taken for granted one must delve into the  depths of man in order to d iscover the origins or seek the ground of know ledge Finally it is that which always escapes the attempt to grasp it It is a  depth that in the same gesture both constitutes who we are and eludes our  understanding it   What centres this episteme then is the idea Foucault calls man Man is  nor the human biological entity Nor is he the creature with reason nor  even Aristotles featherless biped Man is the privileged moment of the  current episteme Man is at once the source and object of investigation  the being in depth that creates the paradoxes inherent in the modern  framework of knowledge Man is what seeks to know himself bur in order  to do so must treat himself as at once the knower and the known and must  constantly oscillate between the two Man is at once the subject and the  object of knowledge This is of course an impossible task an endless one  that can never be completed For as close as one gets to being known one  must always recogn ize that it is oneself as knower  that is engaged in the  knowing and therefore that there is still something left over to be known  the parr that is doing the knowing It is like trying to see ones own eyes   Kant refers to Home as the ph ilosopher who awakens him from his  dogmatic slumber Foucault borrows that image saying that in the   53     THE PHILOSOPHY Of FOUCAULT   modern episteme we are in the midst of an anthropological sleep a rype  of dogmatic slumber that dreams only of man or better that dreams itself  as man dreaming of man That sleep is characterized by the emergence of  the human sciences the sciences of man and by man   For Foucault then man is a recent invention OT 386 This does nor  mean as some have misunderstood it that human beings are a recent  invention or that we have only recently come to recognize human beings as  something special with in nature or that we shall soon give way to another  type of creature What is recent is man as the privi leged source and object  of investigation   Man had been a figure occurring between two modes of language  or rather he was constituted only when language hav ing been situ ated within representation and as it were dissolved in ir freed  itself from that situation at the cost of irs own fragmentation  man composed his own figure in the interstices of rhar fragmented  language Ibid   Man the being of depth that arises when representation no longer captures  the relation of words and things is a historical ent ity And like all historical  entities man will pass and something new will arise Not human beings  man in the very particular sense that it has arisen in the current episteme   Foucaul t concludes The Order oThings with the oracular bur ultimately  historical claim that if the current episteme begins ro lose irs grip on us then  man would be erased li ke a face drawn in sand at the edge of the sea  ibid 397 We should nor rake this pronouncement as a prediction of  some kind of onto logical fall of human beings or their dissolution into  some other world Rather we should rake it as offering the possibility that  just as knowledge was once arranged in such a way that man as the privi leged figure of depth does nor occur so it can be arranged that way again  In the three epistemes Foucault investigates the posi tion of man as at once  subject and object of knowledge arises in only one There is no reason nor  ro believe that this episteme like previous ones will pass and with irs  passing will also pass man   The OrderoThings like Histoire de Ia folie is a book about who we are  about who we rake ourselves to be And in that sense it is at the same rime a  book about who we are nor Vhat the book accompl ishes is to rake a view  of who we are the view given through the recent ly arising human sciences  and specifically biology linguistics and economics and to show that that  view is historically situated The human sciences do nor tell us who we  are or better they do not tell us who we are in a way that is absolute  and unsurpassable Rather they are investigations into who we are that are   54     ARCHAEOLOGICAL HISTORIES OF WHO WE ARE   situated within a certain way of approaching us a certain episterne and irs  specific orientation T his does nor mean that we are not what the human  sciences tell us we are To claim that wou ld require a birdseye view of who  we are Bur if Foucault is right about the existence of epistemes there is no  birdseye view from which to pass such a judgement Rather his claim is  that we do nor have to rake ourselves as being what the human sciences tell  us we are There are other ways for us to see ourselves indeed there have  already been other ways The Order ofThings then is a book about who we  are in a very specific sense It is a book about the historical character of who  we rake ourselves to be   Although like Histoire de Ia folie this book concerns the question of  who we are it approaches irs subject marrer differently from the earl ier  book As Foucault notes rather than seeing us from the viewpoint of our  exclusion of the Other it seeks to articu late the structure of the Same It  tries to describe the historically situated frameworks in which we have  appeared to ourselves as living speaking exchanging beings There is  another difference as well Although the book on madness is concerned  nor only with the discourse on madness bur also wi th the knowledge of  madness The Order of Things focuses exclusively on knowledge Histoire  de Ia folie spends much of irs rime on theories o f madness and of particular  types of madness Bur it also discusses the treatment of the mad the  practices through which the mad were engaged manipulated confined and  observed The Order of Things is solely concerned with knowledge in irs  theoretical aspect Nevertheless both are concerned with the question of  who we are and especially with that questi on as it arises in our historically  situated knowledge of ourselves   Earlier we isolated five elements that are characteristic of Foucaults  approach to the question of who we are Foucault sees our determination  as collective as one that we cannot just shake off as complex as involving  both acting and knowing and as historically contingent We can see three  of these elements clearly in play in both of the books we have recounted  That Histoire de Ia folie and The Order of Things see our determination  as co llective historically contingent and one we cannot just shake off is  straightforward The collective character of our determination arises from  Foucaults account being historical rather than individual He focuses on  the way we see things or have seen them  and the way we act In contrast  for instance to Sarrres early work he does nor account for who we are by  looking at the individual bur rather at the framework of our collective  viewpoints   The archaeological method displays the historical contingency of our  being who we are Foucaults refusal to account for how epistemes change  reflects as we saw a eeriness about progressive views of history By allow  55     THE PHilOSOPHY O f FOUCAULT   ing historical breaks or disconrinuiries inro his narratives he rejects the idea  rhar each episteme is a necessary improvemenr on the previous one Bur in  such a rejection there is also a commirmenr ro historical contingency Since  later frameworks do nor necessarily stem from earlier ones rhe order of  historical frameworks is nor pregiven There is no particular reason why  represenrarion had ro follow resemblance or why the mad had ro be liber ated from physical bondage in order ro suffer moral bondage in rhe late eighteenth cenrury Foucault does nor deny rhac earlier events can cause  later ones However he does nor seek to account for that causal icy wh ich  implies rhar he does nor see a parrern rhar governs historical change His torical change is then conringenr   That we can nor just shake off the historical frameworks in which we find  ourselves is nor something Foucault argues for explicitly Rather ir follows  from his approach He is at pains for instance ro show rhar Tuke and Pinel  do nor initiate a new epoch in the rrearmenr of the mad bur instead reflect  larger changes rhar borh precede and accompany their work Foucault does  nor argue rhar nothing can be done ro change h istorical frameworks in  facr they do change Bur he does nor see rhose changes as being wrought  simply by ind ividual ini tiati ve One migh t wanr to argue here that since he  does nor account for historical breaks he must rlhink rhar nobody has any  ability ro conrribure ro historical change We are all simply prisoners of our  own epistemes   That would be raking Foucaults reticence ro account for change roo far  Foucault is agnostic abour our relation ro historical change nor atheistic  To say rhar we cannot simply shake off our h isroical heritage is nor ro say  that we can have no effect on it Can we as individuals or in a co llective  manner create historical change Foucault does nor tell us his views on  this His reluctance ro discuss how people affect rhe historical trajectories  he recounts has led many people ro think that he is a fatal ist This charge  has followed nor only his archaeo logical works bur his later genealogical  ones as well In the larrer case the accusation is more stinging because as  we shall see the genealogical works are more pol itically charged T heir  stakes concern who we are as a product of relations of power and specific ally relarions of power and knowledge W hen power is ar stake the claim  that we can do nothing about it seems more despairing or even cynical   However rhere seems robe no reason nor ro rake Foucaults histories ro  be anything other than what he often says they are rools to be used to un derstand our situation He does nor give us ontological accounts of who we  are and he is nor seeking to answer questions about free will and determin ism The freedom he accords us comes nor from w ithin rhe deep structure  of human beings bur from wi thin rhe fragi le and conringent nature of our  history Therefore he does nor see himself as owing us a general account of   56     ARCHAEOLOGICAL HISTORIES OF WHO WE ARE   the ways people can or cannot affect their historical siruarion bm instead  an accoum of the situation itself   There are rwo qual ities we have nor discussed yet the fact that who we  are is a maHer of both acting and knowing and the complexity of who  we are As ro the first it appears most clearly in the book on madness The  Order of Things is a more theoretically focused work Foucault does nor  discuss there the use of the human sciences in nontheoretical simarions  although he recognizes rhar there is an imeracrion between theory and  practice In the Archaeology of Knowledge for instance he writes rhar   the determination of the theoretical choices rhar were acmally  made is also dependem on another amhoriry This aurhoriry is  characterized first by the function rhar the discourse under smdy  must carry om in a field of nondiscursive practices Thus General  Grammar played a role in pedagogic practice    AKDL 678   Even in that work however he privileges the discurs ive level as ev idenced  by the terms archive discursive formarion and statenlent that govern  the methodological structure he erects   W hen he moves to his later genealogica l works Foucault will articu late a  deeper imeracrion between the discourse of the human sciences and their  practice and appl ication At this stage of his investigation Foucault is more  imeresred at the discursive level than at the level of practice although prac t ice does appear in the book on madness wi th regard to the rrearmem of the  mad and it appears as well in The Birth of the Clinic which describes the  r ise of clinical medicine and the views of life and death that arise in irs  wake   The issue of complexity is itself a complex one h depends in parr  on ones view of the srams of archaeo logy Ye have seen that Foucault  is unclear at this stage in his writings abom the range of appl ication of  his analyses Is the relation of reason ro madness in Histoire de Ia folie a  marrer all of reason Does the reason rhar rakes pacricular forms in relation  to irs Other characterize the enrire srrucrure of reason in a given period  If there is no such thing as an ah istorical Reason is there such a thing as  a historically simated Reason We might ask the same questions abom  epistemes about the extenr of their reach in particular historical periods  Sometimes Foucault characterizes them as structures rhar lie beneath emire  cu lm raJ formations At other rimes he denies this In The Archaeology of  Knowledge for instance he writes rhar The relations I have described  are valid in order to define a particular configuration they are nor signs to  describe the face of a cu lmre in irs totality ibid 159 When we turn to  Foucaults genealogical works we shall see a more clearly demarcated set   57     THE PHilOSOPHY Of FOUCAULT   of limitations on his ana lyses At the archaeological stage ir is unclear  whether the archaeological layers he uncovers are meanr to characterize a  smaller or larger parr of the terrain he is investigating   In viewing the last rwo characteristics of Foucaults work we have seen  rwo sets of questions arise The first concerns the relations between the  discursive and the nondiscursive Although Foucault claims at rimes to be  investigating both the archaeo logical works place their accenr on what is  said at the expense of what is done Is there a separable relation berween  the rwo or is it rather that in order to understand one requires at the same  rime an investigation of the other To understand what is said or what can  be said does there nor have to be an investigation of the doings in which  those sayings are caught up wh ich frame them and confer their legitimacy  or illegitimacy Alrernarively does the relation between the rwo nor also  flow in the other direction where certain say ings create or prevent or trans mute the doings they come inro conracr with Perhaps it would be best ro  drop the distinction between the rwo altogether and to invest igate the  practices in which both arise simultaneously   The other set of questions concerns the status of the archives Foucault  describes their specificity and their general ity Archaeology which works  across a particular chronological stratum seems ro imply a commonal ity  among d iscourses in a given historical period both within a culture and  across cu ltures Is Foucault committed to this Should we fo llow the lead  of the works themselves wh ich seem more expansive in this regard Or  should we instead rarify some of the commenrs he makes abour the works  often afterwards wh ich point to a more limited scope Foucault himself  seems to struggle with this problem   There is a third set of questions as well one that relates to the status of  the works themselves In The Archaeology of Knowledge Foucaul t tells us  consistenT with the approach of his wri tings that it is nor possible for us  to describe our own archive since it is from w ithin these ru les that we  speak since it is that which gives us what we can say AKDL 130 This  staremenr raises rwo questions one having ro do with the sratemenr itself  and the other with irs implication for his histories As far as the statement  itself goes there is a problem of what is known philosophically as reflexiv ity If it is nor possible for us to describe our own archive how does he  know that we speak within irs rules To know that wou ld seem to imply  that we can step outside our own archive at leasiT far enough to recognize  rhar it has a particular set of ru les Bur that is precisely what Foucault says  cannot be done To say that one cannot describe ones own arch ive is a  bit like saying I always lie There is something selfdefeating abour ir  since it assumes a srandpoinr that the sraremenr itself denies It seems that  the best Foucault can do in this area is plead ignorance abour the archival   58     ARCHAEOLOGICAL HISTORIES OF WHO WE ARE   nature of his own discourse His arrempt to simate us historically within an  archive is selfrefuting   The implication for his histories is this If we are speaking from within  our own archive and if its ru les and norms are as ungrounded and as  changeable as say that of the classical or the modern episteme what does  that mean for the status of his historical narratives Should we take them as  accurate depictions of the frameworks of knowledge that operate in the  periods he describes Or should we instead and perhaps more consisten tly  see them simply as descriptions that come from a particular archive no  worse and no berrer than competing descriptions that could be offered  from the perspective of different archives   Foucault concludes The Archaeology of Knowledge with a wrirren self interv iew It is an honest piece of selfreflection during which he asks  himself XIhat then is the t itle of you r discourse Where does it come from  and from where does it derive its right to speak How could it be legitim ated He responds thus  admit that this quest ion embarrasses me  more than your earl ier objections    my discourse far from determining  the locus in which it speaks is avoiding the ground on which it could find  support ibid 205 The question of the status o f Foucaults archaeolo gical writings is one that he never resolves It rema ins alongside the issue  of the relation of the d iscursive and the nondiscursive and the question  of the general scope of the archaeologies among the challenges facing  Foucaults archaeological project He does not adequately answer them  because he moves on to another project or at least modifies the project  enough to give it another name Genealogy rep laces archaeology   Should we reproach him for this Does he owe us an account of the suc cess or failure of archaeology to address these questions He does not think  so When he confronts himself at the outset of The Archaeology of Know  ledge with the charge that he keeps changing the character of what he is  doing he responds to himself by saying Do not ask who I am and do not  ask me to remain the same leave it to our bureaucrats and our pol ice to  see that our papers are in order ibid 17 This is I believe the right  response Not because one should never answer for anyth ing one wri tes  Bur because one need not answer for everything one writes every aspect  of ones perspective Sometimes it is enough just to move on   Many philosophers spend the early part of their careers staking our a  small piece of philosophical territory and the rest of their professional  lives patro lling that territory rather than investigating what else might be  our there It is for all bur very few phi losophers  those who can mine a  particular problem more deeply with each investigation always finding a  hidden seam with new riches  a sad and futile exercise Foucault does not  do this He moves on His archaeologies are a rype of invest igation his   59     THE PHILOSOPHY Of FOUCAULT   genealogies anorher If Foucaulr does nor offer us rhe model of phi lo sophical consistency if he changes direction several rimes over rhe course  of his career and if he loses or gains readers in rhe process perhaps we  should nor faulr him for rhis Perhaps we should see his

Paris and elsewhere  events that have  both d iscursive and nondiscursive aspects  alter the character of French  life They also alter the character of French thought To recount these  events in anything like the complexity they deserve is beyond the scope of  this book Moreover any approach to the events of May or  May 68  invites controversy No period in French history s ince the Second World  Var has generated as much discussion as these two months in the late  1960s Are the events revo lutionary or are they just the indulgence of  middleclass students Have they had a longlasting impact on French  culture or po litics or are their effects loca lized to a time and place Do they  contribute to the rise of an independent French approach to the world or  simply stall its economic development Are the events primarily a cu ltural  phenomenon or do they rise or descend to the level of politics One cannot  interpret the events without becoming implicitl y or exp licitl y com mined  on these and other quest ions 1   Let us be brief In May 1968 students at the university at Namerre go on  strike to protest their administrations temporary closing of the university  in the wake of demands for antiimperialist study T hese strikes are  soon followed by workers strikes and intersection of these st rikes brings  together at least temporari ly rwo sections of the French population that  are traditionally separate from each other In Paris barricades are built in  the st reets and it looks for a br ief period as though President de Gaulles  government might fall  It would be the first revolution in modern Western  Europe succeeding where the revolts of 1848 and 1871 fai l T he French  Communist Parry rakes a stand against the students and workers largely  because it is caught unawares by the events and does nor find itself in the  vanguard where it considers irs rightful place to be By mid to late June  civic order is restored The character of many French citizens sense of them selves however is transformed as is the landscape of French intellectual life   61     THE PHILOSOPHY Of FOUCAULT   Up until the events of May the French political scene could be nearly  divided into the communists on the left and the lilberals on the right There  are of course gradations in between bur the primary battleground con cerns these rwo ideologies One is either with Sarrre the communist or  Raymond Aron the liberal The events do nor change the libera l side If any thing they reinforce the liberal view of the irresponsibiliry of rad icalism  On the left however everyth ing changes The political bankruptcy of the  French Communist Parry which had aligned itself with the rightist de  Gaulle is there for al l to see No longer would communism in France be the  hope of the left Or more accurately no longer would the communism of  the French Communist Parry or any other party claiming to speak for the  masses be the lefts hope The Parry betrays the workers It does nor lead  them in the moment of transformation It does nor even follow it resists  from the righ t in the name of its own leadership T he left will have to look  elsewhere for its models   This change does nor involve a sh ift from one set of allegiances to an other There is at this rime no other systematic competing set of ideas to  embrace Parry communism does nor have an alternative And yet this as it  turns our is the good news The intellectual culture in France in the decade  or so after May 68 particularly in irs po litical thought is among the most  fru itful in recent history There is an explosion of po litical or politically  relevant thought from a number of angles that comes to occupy the place  vacated by the French Communist Parry Nor only Foucault but also G illes  Deleuze JeanFranois Lyotard Luce lrigaray Jacques Derrida Ju lia Kris reva Alain Badiou Jacques Ranciere and others provide political reflection  or politically charged phi losophical reflection that points in new directions  and offers new ways to conceive our relations m the world and to one  another T imes of crisis when the old order comes unglued and the  new one has not yet coalesced can act as a spur ro creativiry Think of the  Renaissance for instance The postMay period in French intellectual  culmre is one of those times   Foucaul t is not in Paris during the events of May He is teaching instead  at the Universiry of Tunis in Tunisia However soon after the events of  May he returns to France to head the ph ilosophy department at Vincennes  a gathering some would call it a ghetto of the French intellectual left  After the publication of The Archaeology of Knowledge he does not publish  a book for seven years H is shorter writings and activity though take on  an increasingly pol itical tinge This tinge is in evidence in the inaugural  address of his appointment to Frances most prestigious insti tution of  higher learning the College de France T here he discusses the will to  truth as a power imposed to limit discourse and prevent creative thought  and he announces his future research programme It comprises two aspects   62     GENEALOGICAl HISTORIES OF WHO WE ARE   The first is a critical one that isolates the forms of exclusion limitation  and appropriation of discourse AKDL 231 The second is a genealogical  one that shows how series of discourse are formed through in spi re of  or with the aid of these systems of constraint whar were the specific norms  for each and what were their conditions of appearance growth and varia t ion ibid 232   The second project is the one that Foucault eventually embraces And in  embracing it he sh ifts his focus from the more pure ly discursive to incor porate the nondiscursive as wel l He describes the rise and the effects  especially political effects of various practices and their intersection And  as he mentions in his inaugural address he gives this historical description  the name genealogy   What is genealogy Most of us are probably most familiar with the term  in its appl ication to familial lineage To trace a family genealogy is to trace  ones ancestors to fo llow backwards or forwards the marriage and kin sh ip lines that yield oneself ones siblings ones c hi ldren  There is some thing of this going on in Foucaults genealogies The idea of asking who  one is by way of tracing how one has arrived at this point is certain ly in  accordance with his method In addi tion as we shall see just as the roots  of a fami ly genealogy become more dispersed the further back or the fur ther forward one goes Foucaults genealogies do not found themselves  at a particular privi leged starring point TI1ere is no pristine moment of  origin no point of creation Everything begins dispersed without centre or  unity   However there are important differences as well First instead of t rac ing the evolution of marriages Foucault traces the evolution of practices  Secondly and fo llowing directly from this the question of who one is  becomes as it is in the archaeo logical works a collective question rather  than an ind ividual one The product of a Foucauldian genealogy is not an I  it is a we Thirdly in as much as fami lial genealogies seek to give a single  answer to the question of who one is and of course they need not do so  Foucault breaks with that approach Un like a fam ily genealogy of which  there can only be one genealogies of practices are many and various Ve  are involved in many different practices and although particular ones may  be more importantly determinative for who we a re no single one or no  single group has a privi leged position one that guides the others or to  which the others can be reduced Fourthly Foucaults genealogies are tied  to the politics of truth It is not simply practices that Foucault is interested  in it is the politics and epistemology of those practices and especially the  bond between their politics and their epistemology   The term genealogy is one that Foucault borrows from N ierzsche  Nietzsche uses it to describe the emergence of what he thinks of as force   63     THE PHILOSOPHY Of FOUCAULT   relat ions in regard to particular institutions or practices These forces are  broadly speaking active and reactive ones Active forces are at once crea tive and dest ructive if they are destructive though it is as a byproduct of  their creativity Active forces seek to express themselves whether by art istic or martial or athletic or other means Reactive forces by contrast do  not seek to express themselves They are as their name impl ies forces that  react to active ones Essentially reactive forces are those that are unable to  express themselves as active forces do so their form of expression is para sitical upon that of active ones T hat form of expression is largely negative  they seek to undermine the expression of active forces For Nietzsche then  reactive forces are in a close alignment with resentment with a hatred for  the expression characteristic of acti  e forces   The question for Nietzsche is given a particular institution or practice  what is currently dominating it active or reactive forces This is where  genealogy comes in  Genealogy is the tracing of the history of an institution  or a practice by asking which forces have taken hold of it active or reactive  ones One cannot project back from ones current position the meaning  or origin of an institution or practice History is in Nietzsches eyes the  struggle for dominance among and between active and reactive forces He  points out in On the Genealogy of Morals   that everyth ing which happens in the organic world is part of a  process of overpowering mastering and that in turn all over powering and mastering is a reinterpretatlion a manipulation  in the course of which the previous meaning and aim 1nust  necessarily be obscured or completely effaced   This approach has several elements that find their way into Foucaults  own genealogies First  genealogy does not search for an origin a well spring from which the practices one is investigating can be understood in  their essence For some who seek to understand particular practices the  key is to dig beneath all the historical transformations in order to discover  the original character of the practice Martin Heidegger for instance holds  that in order to understand the quest ion of Being we need to go back to its  original asking before it was buried under the Weight of the metaphysical  tradition Genealogy rejects this approach Of course all practices begin  somehow However their beginning does not give us any privi leged insight  into their essential character   The reason for this and this is the second element Foucault adopts is  that there is no essential character that practices contain For Nietzsche as  for Foucault what counts is not essence but historical legacy To discover  the character of a practice is to trace the roles it plays the intersections with   64     GENEALOGICAl HISTORIES OF WHO WE ARE   other practices it maintains the meanings ascribed to it and that emerge  from ir over the course of irs evolution Foucaul t departs from Nietzsche  in Nietzsches attempt ro interpret this evolution in terms of active and  react ive forces For Foucault there are no forces that form a framework  for interpretation However the difference here amounts to less than it  might seem   In Foucaults genealogical writings as in N ietzsches there is a st rong  normative flavour Foucault at rimes characterizes his works as description  rather than recommendation bur this is a bit disingenuous As we shall see  Foucault is clearly critical of the penal project of rehabilitation as he is  of the interpretative projects that have come to surround our sexual ity  Nietzsche uses valueladen terms  active and react ive  in his genealogical  studies They form the normative framework of his approach If Foucault  does nor have an overt normative framework he certainly knows what he  doesnt li ke what he finds in the term he sometimes uses intolerable This  is the third element he borrows from Nietzsche   Those familiar wi th Nietzsches and Foucaults writings might wish to  object here that although their genealogies are both normatively laden  there is a very different set of norms to which each is attached After all  Nietzsches view is aristocratic He has no use as he repeated ly insists  for anything democratic For him it is the strong and the creative that are  worthy he is nor concerned with the oppressed Foucault on the other  hand never ceases to speak alongside although never in the name of the  oppressed Vherher it is the mad prisoners homosexuals or outcasts he  embraces those who find themselves in positions of weakness rather than  strength   There is something to this objection Nietzsche indeed is no democrat   However it would be easy to make roo much of this difference for two rea sons First Nietzsches active forces are themselves in danger of becoming  outcasts The mass of humanity for which to be sure he d isplays no sym pathy  always seek to destroy or at least to margina lize active forces This  is why he says the strongest and most fortunate are weak when opposed  by organized herd instincts by the timid ity o f the weak by the vast  majority   Strange though it may sound one always has to defend the  strong against the weak Secondly there is an important similarity  between the objects of Nietzsches and of Foucaults criticism They both  target the mind less conformism that characterizes contemporary society  For Nietzsche that conformism is a product of the dominance of reactive  forces for Foucault it has more to do with historically grounded realities  such as the emergence of capitalism and the evoluiion of church doctrine  However both share a revulsion against conformiry that characterizes the  world each of them lives in   65     THE PHilOSOPHY OF FOUCAULT   The debt that Foucault owes ro Nierzsche in adopting the genealogical  approach becomes clear in an essay he publishes in 1971 a year after his  inaugural lecture at the College de France and four years before the  appearance of his first fulllength genealogy Discipline and Punish T he  essay entitled Nietzsche Genealogy History is at once a rendering  of Nietzsches genealogical method and an announcement of his own It  begins with the lines Genealogy is gray meticulous and patiently docu mentary It operates on a field of entangled and confused parchments on  documents that have been scratched over and recopied many rimes NGH  139 These words are perhaps a better characterization of Foucaults more  derai led approach than Nietzsches method of painting with broad brush  stro kes bur it does emphasize the historical character of both projects The  similarity deepens as the essay unfolds   After a critique of histories that rely on the concept of origins and grand  beginnings Foucault notes that Nierzsches genealogical method is engaged  in a twofold task Herkzmft and Entstehung or in rhe English translation  descent and emergence Together they constitute a historical approach that  abandons the ideas of history as having particular aims or goals as being a  unified goal wi th a decipherable meaning and as having an essential origin  that has made us who we are or alternatively from which we have strayed  Descent approaches history by means of seeking the separate dispersed  events that have come together in a contingent way to form a particular  practice Rather than looking for the golden threads that bind history to gether descent seeks the comingrobe of a practice in events that are often  small ignored close to the ground and disparate from one another Emer gence on the other hand describes the hazardous play of dominations  ibid 148 that forms the history of a given practice or group of practices  Emergence in Nietzsches view is a matter of the domination of active and  reactive forces Rather than seeking the meaning o f a practice in the goals it  sets itself or the ro le it sees itself as fu lfi lling Nietzsche asks whether a prac tice is oriented towards creation and expression or instead toward resent ment and smallmindedness Bur emergence can be seen and Foucault will  see it this way as a matter of what effects deleterious or helpful the uses to  which practices are pur give rise at different rimes and places   Together descent and emergence offer a view of history that traces the  emergence and dissolution of practices and of the uniti es those practices  temporarily form with other practices It is a history without origin goal  or meaning It is a history in which disparate practices come together and  then disperse in unpredictable ways and it is a history in which this coming  together and dispersing produce a number of unforeseen effects that  can resu lt in a variety of dominations T his does nor imply however that  recounting this history is po intless After all human beings are without   66     GENEALOGICAl HISTORIES OF WHO WE ARE   origin goal or meaning Genealogy then is a project of tell ing us about  who we are Ir tells us without reference to the framing assumptions of  much of the history of philosophy   And in doing so it tells us two other things as wel l It allows us to see how  aspects of ourselves that we thought were natura l or inescapable turn our  instead robe historical and in fact historically contingent We did nor have  to become who we are and in rurn we can become somethi ng other than  what we are It also allows us to see some of the effects of being who we are  now effects that perhaps we would rather nor be parry to   There is no single story of who we are that Foucault has to tell His  genealogies do nor seek to cover the broad sweep of our historical legacy  More clearly and more consciously than in his archaeo logical works  Foucault rakes his genealogies ro trace aspects of who we have come robe  of who we are now If our history is a matter of the unfolding of temporary  un ities from dispersed origins then who we are is a matter nor of any par t icular unity bur of a variety of overlapping and intersecting un ities of prac t ices Although at rimes Foucault uses images that suggest he is describing  an entire cultural formation a close reading of his genealogical works shows  that those images are rhetorical more than substantive In each case Foucault  describes an important parr of who we are and how we came to be that way  In no case does he rake himself as accounting for all of ir The writer John  Berger observes Never again will a single story be told as though it were  the only one 5 It is an observation that Foucaults writings embody   There are rwo major works of Foucaults rhar fall clearly under the  category of genealogy the book on the punishment enti tled Discipline and  Punish and the first volume of The History of Se1rality Of these only the  first is a fu llfledged historical study The latter is both methodological and  programmatic It offers a clear delineation of the method that was used in  the prison book and is to be used in a larger srudy o f sexual ity and it offers  a brief historical framework for the genea logical study of sexual ity The  latter project for reasons we shall discuss more fully below is never  completed Instead Foucault turns from his proposed study of sexual ity to  the larger project of selfmaking and at the same rime widens the historical  scope of his study He starts with the Greeks rather than as is his wont the  Renaissance or early postRenaissance   A history of the prisons   Discipline and Punish displays an important similarity ro Foucaults book  on madness In both as wi ll also be the case with rlhe book on sexuality he   67     THE PHilOSOPHY O f FOUCAULT   performs what we might cal l an inversion of a received view In Histoire de  Ia folie the inversion rakes place with regard to the work ofTuke and Pinel  On the received view both are thought to be liberators of the mad  unchaining them and releasing them from their barbarous conditions  Foucault argues that although this may be true there is an opposite move ment as well a rechaining of the mad Released from their physical bonds  the mad will now be bound by moral bonds that are as sure as if nor more  sure than the physical bondage to which they were previously subject   We must be carefu l here nor to misunderstand the inversion Foucault  performs He does not argue although the view has been ascribed ro him  that things were better in earl ier periods and ave now become worse  Nierzsches work often suggests this type of historical decline or regression  It is nor Foucaults position The inversion he performs is nor a simple one  in which we are to ld that things have become berrer when in fact they have  become worse To deny the assumption of a progressive history does nor  require rhar one embrace the assumption of a regressive history The inver sion Foucaults studies perform seeks to show that what has been called  a progressive history moment is accompanied by a movement that is also  deleterious This does nor reverse the assumption of historical progress  ir complicates ir   What is the story of historical progress that Fou cault reverses in his book  on punishment and the prisons It is a story we are all fami liar with even if  we have no background in penal study It is a story of penal progress from  vengeance to rehabilitation   In the early history of punishment punishment rakes the form of ret ri bution The offender is treated as something beneath or beyond human  concern Hav ing committed a crime the offender is subject to any form of  punishment the social body deems appropriate to mere our Torture phys ical and psychological abuse public humiliation these are all among the  range of punishments available to a society that wants on ly to get back at  criminals for the wrongs they have committed It is probably worth noting  that this sentiment which was once thought obsolete can be seen on full  display in the United Stares before the implementation of a death penalry It  is inscribed on the placards and etched in the faces of those who stand out side the prisons anticipating the execution T here are fewer reminders of  how little distance we have travelled from the rime of public tormre more  powerful than those gatherings   In any case so the story goes we have death penalty celebrations not withstanding become more civi lized Rehabilitation has replaced torture  and public punishment as the preferred response ro crime Rather than sim ply punishing criminals for what they have done we now seek to change  them make them into something that can navigate society in a different   68     GENEALOGICAL HISTORIES OF WHO WE ARE   way Crime on rhis view is nor simply an acr rhar requires vengeance ir is  a behaviour rhar requires inrervenrion The criminal is nor simply ro be  punished for commirring an acr Once rhe criminaO is in rhe custody of rhe  srare rhe proper approach is ro work on rhe criminal so as ro promote a  differenr sryle of engaging with the world a differenr behavioural reper toire Wherher by instilling proper work habits or offering insigh t inro  the causes of rhe aberranr behaviour or breaking individuals down boot camp style and rebu ilding rhem or reinforcing good habirs while seeking to  extinguish bad ones or by some combination of these criminals are not  simply to be harmed They are robe improved   In this way the rreatmenr of criminals has become more humane It is no  longer a ceremony of degradation or abuse Rather ir is a policy of im

lirde ro undermine thar  srory Foucault recounts rhe public rorrure of an artempred regicide named  Damiens that rakes place in 1757 The spectacle is gruesome Ir involves  burning and peeling skin from rhe offender drawing and quartering slicing  limbs all in an order rhar would seek to cause rhe maximum amount of  pain This account is immediately followed by one rhar could not provide a

is an exercise in vengeance rhe second an exercise in rehabilita t ion Foucaults placing of these rwo approaches side by side shows rhar  he recognizes that there is somerhing to rhe received view Bur ir is also  misleading Thar is where rhe genealogical history begins   Foucaults history does nor as his recitation of the case of Damiens ex empl ifies rake issue wirh rhe early parr of rhe received

THE PHILOSOPHY Of FOUCAULT   innocent until proved gui lty Recall though rhar former President Ronald  Reagans Anorney General Edwin Meese once defended rhe denial of  righ ts ro suspects by saying rhar if rhey werent guilty rhey wouldnt be sus peers However during rhe classical period gu ilt occurs by degrees Tlms  a semiproof did nor leave rhe suspect innocem umi l such rime as ir was  completed ir made him semigu ilty slight evid ence of a serious crime  marked someone as sl ightly criminal DP 42 A suspect rhen is always  deserving of rorrure   It is during punishmem rhar rhe criminals bod y is subject ro pain and  becomes public In France rhe procedure is called supplice which translates  imo Engl ish as torture However we should nor rhink of supplice as a  simple barbarity performed upon rhe body of rhe criminal Supplice is nor  chaoric or arbitrary lr is a measured and calculated response ro criminality  one rhar has rhree elemems rhe infliction of a measured amoum of pain  rhe regulation of rhar pain and rhe rirualisric character of rhe application  of techniques producing pain Suppice is a righrly choreographed public  rima of agony and ir finds irs sear in rhe narure of criminality itself   Criminal ity is often rhoughr of among other ways as an offence against  rhe social body This is as rrue of earlier periods as iris now However rhe  character of rhe social body in for instance preRevolmion France is dif ferenr lr is nor rhe people bur rhe sovereign rhe king who is considered the  bearer of rhe elemems of the social body Whereas in democratic regimes  ar least in principle rhe people are thought to be the constiruems of rhe so cial body in earlier monarchies rhe king plays thar role lr is nor as though  there are no people bur rather rhe

Criminality is an arrack on the social body on the body of rhe king It is a  personal arrack an injury anempred against rhe regal body   In order ro reestablish the sovereignty of rhe regal body rhe

lating that sovereignty themselves The  public execution Foucault says has a juridicopol irical function It is a  ceremonial by which a momentari ly injured sovereign is reconstituted It  restores that sovereignty by manifesting it at irs most spectacular DP 48   One can see then why punishment cannot be a blind rage However  agon izing it may be for the criminal it remains an expression of the sover eign and rhus must bear the stamp of both his power and his bearing In  order to do so it must be controlled To strike without control is a display of  weakness not strength    There are at least two potential difficulties with this particular exercise of  the power to punish The first is that the grand display of this asymmetry of  power can backfire Alongside the public awe at the power of the king and  alongside the fear that that power invokes it can also happen  and it did  happen  that the public comes to identify with the object of punishment  and rhus becomes resentfu l of the sovereign T his is particularly true when  the criminal displays dignity under torture or when the punishment seems  to go roo far into the realm of the spectacular or when the criminal derides  the authorities for their own abuses In cases like these the public comes at  rimes to identify with the criminal and this leads to resistance against these  exercises of sovereignty In add ition all criminal ity represents a rebell ion  against the current social order a rebellion that would find sympathy in a  large portion of a public who suffers under great d isparities in wealth and  comfort that are parr of the structure of that order T he cure for all this it  would seem would be to soften punishment to make it less an expression  of power and more an expression of justice   And indeed there is a reform movement that seeks to soften punishment  Bur nor only soften it A number of changes are raking place during the sec ond half of the eighteenth century   The sh ift from a criminality of blood to a criminal ity of fraud  forms parr of a whole complex mechanism embracing the devel opment of production the increase of wealth a higher juridical  and moral value placed on property relations stricter methods of  surveillance a righter partitioning of the population more efficient  techniques of locating and obtaining information DP 77   Because of these changes and in particular because of the change of prop erty relations to which many of these relate another concern comes to the  surface as wel l   Up to this point punishment is as sporadic as it is gruesome To be sure  the consequences of gening caught are dire However many people do not  get caught and this is the second difficulty with supplice The arrangement   71     THE PHilOSOPHY O f FOUCAULT   works tolerably wel l as long as the institution of private property is in irs  infancy Bur as it matures with it grows the necessity of a more universal  form of punishment Al l property must be protected and since property  is dispersed among many individuals protection from criminality must be  afforded to all of them   The true objective of the reform movement even it irs most general  formulations was nor so much ro establish a new right ro punish  based on more equitable principles as to set up a new economy of  the power to punish   so that it should be distributed in homo geneous circu its capable of operating everywhere in a continuous  way down to the finest grain of the social body Ibid 80   The question becomes how is this to happen How can one construct a  penal structure that will protect against all the perry crimes that had once  been tacitly rolerared while at rhe same rime generating universal respect  so that it does nor suffer the same problems as supplice   To this the penal reformers have an answer One must design punish ments that are cal ibrated to crimes so as to ensure deterrence If the loss to  be incurred outweighs the gain of the crime and if one is certain that by  committing that crime one will also incur that loss the crime is less likely  robe commirred6 To find the suitable punishment for a crime is to find  the disadvantage whose idea is such that it robs for ever the idea of a crime  of any attraction ibid 104 In addition the populace is less likely to  become upset with the authorities Since the response is nor ro perform an  outrage upon the body bur to deter crime then there is no spectacle to  which the public is called to react A sober system of measured punishments  is what is needed to eliminate crime  particularly crime against property  ro ensure public order and ro be capable of universal application   Why is it then that rather than adopting this system of punishments  each designed ro deter the crime it responds ro only one type of punish ment emerges for everyone during the early nineteenth century Why is it  that there emerges a single answer for all crimes an answer that remains  with us today W hy imprisonment   The subtitle of Discipline and Punish is La Naissance de Ia prison the  birth of the prison It is at this point that Foucaults genealogical method  begins ro emerge Up to this point it is easy ro thin k that the story Foucault  is telling is a linear one that it traces a singu lar th read through its chrono logical weave This would nor be genealogy as Foucault describes it in his  essay on Nietzsche It wou ld involve a unity of origin rather than a d isper sion that comes together into a temporary unity And because of this it   72     GENEALOGICAl HISTORIES OF WHO WE ARE   would invite a reading that sees history as either progressive or regressive  Either punishment is better and more humane than it used to be or it is  worse   This is nor how Foucault approaches the birth o f the prison To be sure  there is a certa in continuity between earl ier and later forms of punishment  They are both after a ll ways of dealing with criminal ity And moreover  both involve the app lication of particular techniques to the body How ever the later form of punishment which Foucault calls discipline is nor  merely a development from an insular history of punishment If it were  then one wou ld expect that the advice of the reformers of the late eigh t eenth century wou ld have been taken It is not In fact the emergence of the  prison is in direct contradiction to the ideas of the reformers Rather than  marching punishment to crime it affords a single punishment for all  cnmes   To account for this emergence Foucault looks beyond the prison to  other more farflung practices   The invention of this new po litical anatomy must not be seen as a  sudden discovery It is rather a multiplicity of often minor proc esses of different origin and scattered location which overlap re peat or imitate one another support one another distinguish  themselves from one another according to their domain of applica tion converge and gradually produce the blueprint of a general  method Ibid  138   Among these minor processes are the regimented rime schedules charac teristic of the monastery and the precisely calibrated movements that are  taught to the so ld iers of the Prussian army These and other practices  gradually converge on the issue of punishment and over the course of  the late eigh teenth and early nineteenth centuries yield the blueprint of a  general method of discipline   Discipline as Foucaul t uses the term is more specific than simply the  control of the behaviour of others It may be defined as the project for the  bodys optimization for turning the body into a well regulated machine by  means of breaking down irs movements into their smallest elements and  then building them back into a maximally efficient whole This project does  not simply concern individuals however It also concerns their relations  Discip line must ensure that space is properly partitioned so that individuals  can relate to one another in maximally efficient ways It must ensure the  proper rime coordination among activities as weJI as within them It is a  process that is applied both to bodies and to the interaction between them   73     THE PHilOSOPHY OF FOUCAULT   The ability to accomplish this requ ires an enclosed area in which the  movements of individuals and the partitioned space of their relations can  be monitored and intervened upon That is what a prison is   If discipl ine sounds like training for factory work it should It is also  however how schools are run break down what is to be learned into  manageable segments and then have students master each segment before  moving on It is how businesses are run how hospitals are run often how  athletics is taught and how we run our lives As Foucault asks Is it surpris ing that prisons resemble factories schools barracks hospitals wh ich all  resemble prisons DP 228   Foucaul t isolates three central aspects of disciplinary training hierarch ical observation normalizing judgement and examination Hierarchical  observation involves a certain economy of the gaze There are observers  and observed The observer is to monitor the observed from a hierarchical  distance so that the observer sees but is nor seen and the observed is seen  bur does nor see or at least does nor see the observer  In this way the  observer can see what the observed is doing what they are nor doing and  how well or poorly they are doing it For their part the observed since they  are continuously monitored become subject to the gaze of the observer  They must always be on They can never let up They must be as efficient  as possible   Normal izing judgement is a binary operation that works by means of  both conformity and individualization Conformity is to the norm itself  the standard that each must strive to meet individual ity is the requirement  of a set of interventions on particular individuals in order to get them to  ach ieve the norm These interventions are trained upon minute elements of  a persons behaviour They come to bear at very specific points in the beha vioural unfolding of an activity seeking to maximize it through rewards  punishments or other types of motivation Think of a child who cannot use  her fork in the proper manner Here the parent says first hold it like  this Good very good Now bring it down to your food No nor like that  thats wrong like this Yes better     The emergence of normalization is a revolution nor only in penal reform  but also in the conception and character of who we are Foucault describes  normalizing judgement as directly opposed ro earlier approaches to punish ment which operate  nor by hierarchizing but quire simply by bringing  into play the binary opposi tion of the permitted and the forbidden nor by  homogenizing bur by operating the division acquired once and for all of  condemnation ibid 183 In earl ier forms of punishment one does nor  worry about where one stands in relation to the norm or the normal The  reason for this is that there is no norm or normal There are acts that are  forbidden and others  the rest that are permitted For the former there   74     GENEALOGICAl HISTORIES OF WHO WE ARE   are dire consequences if one is caught For the latter there is no need for  intervention There may be t raditions govern ing behaviour bur there are  no norms of the kind discipline develops   Contrast that with our more normalized society Who among us does nor  wonder whether their behaviour is normal W ho among us is nor con strained by the concern that they may be weird or off or nor li ke everyone  else Who is nor driven in parr by the motivation to avoid the need for  counsel ling or therapy or some other intervention w hose goal is to pur one  back on the right track Who does not feel the shadow of normality over  their shoulder In o lder forms of punishment the binary division between  the permitted and the forbidden leaves one side of that division alone In a  society in thrall to normalization no behaviour is immune to scrutiny As  my therapist friends say everyone is a little sick so everyone can benefit  from some therapy When the say it they mean ir as an advertisement for  their profession bur it reveals a deeper truth one Foucault finds in the  emergence of discipline   The power of the Norm appears throughout the disciplines Is this  the new law of modern society Let us say rather that since the  eighteenth century it has joined other powers  the Law the Word  Parole and the Text Tradition  imposing new del imitations  upon them Ibid  184   We might recal l here the analysis in Histoire de Ia folie of the emergence  of the moral character of therapy in the practices ofT uke and Pinel The  bonds placed by these figures are no longer physical ones they are moral  and psychological Concurrent with the rise of normalization there is also  the rise of psychology as both a science of the normal and a practice of  turning the abnormal into the normal Psychology as a study o f and inter vention into human behaviour has irs roots and irs orientation provided  by the twin poles of conformity and individualization characteristic of the  normalizing judgement of discipl ine   Here we see at work one of the concepts for which Foucault has become  famous and at rimes notorious power knowledge It is probably the  most often misunderstood concept in his corpus The concept of power knowledge denies that one can hold knowledge to be divorced from power  that one cn partition off all the relations of power in which people are  involved in order to ach ieve a knowledge purged of politic impurities  a neutral ground so to speak Perhaps he says we should abandon a  who le tradition that allows us to imagine that knowledge can exist only  where the power relations are suspended and that knowledge can develop  only outside irs injunctions irs demands and irs interests ibid 27   75     THE PHilOSOPHY OF FOUCAULT   This does nor mean however rhar all knowledge is reducible ro power  relations or rhar knowledge is simply a mask for power T hat would nor be  powerknowledge ir would just be power Instead we should think of  knowledge as something that is embedded in inseparable from power rela tions bur sti ll a form of knowledge In fact as we shall see in detai l when  we discuss power in the context of the first volume of Foucaults history of  sexual ity the emergence of knowledge and its object can occur at the same  rime Psychological knowledge for example is parr of a larger whole  discipline that does nor simply understand bur at the same rime creates  llvho e are   To pur the point another way power does nor only stop things from hap pening It is not merely a negative or repressive operation It also creates  things If this is the case then psychological knowledge is not simply a mask  for power lr actually is knowledge bur it is knowledge of something it has  also participated in creating   These powerknowledge relations are ro be analysed therefore  not on the basis of a subject of knowledge who is or is not free in  relation to the power system bur on the cont rary the subject who  knows the objects to be known and the modalities of knowledge  must be regarded as so many effects of these fundamenta l implica tions of powerknowledge and their historical transformations   Ibid 27 8   In add ition to hierarch ical observation and norma lizing judgement dis cipline involves a third element examination We have all been subject to  it whether in school during job training or in a hospital The examination  forms an element of the feedback loop of discipline lr marks our where  each of us stands relative to the standard the Norm to which we are being  compared If hierarchical observation seeks to maximize efficiency by over seeing activity the examination provides the feedback necessary ro recog nize the degree to which that efficiency has been internalized the degree  to which ir has become parr o f us or in the terms we have been using has  become a parr of who we are now   Foucaul t sums up rhe elements of discipl ine and their operation in rhe  arresting image of Jeremy Benthams Panopricon Bentham rhe founder of  modern uti litarian moral theory offers in 1791 a design for a prison one  that is never built rhar he ca lls rhe Panopricon Essentially the Panopricon  is constructed like a ring around a central core T he ring holds the prison ers rhe cenrral core the guards The prison is constructed so that the guards  can look out and see inside all the prison cells The prisoners however  cannot see into rhe central core Therefore although one cannot watch all   76     GENEALOGICAl HISTORIES OF WHO WE ARE   the prisoners at once no prisoner can see who is being observed and who  is nor One must act as though one is always being observed since at any  particular momem one might be   Bur there is more In the Panopricon since one cannot see the guards  and since one must assume that one is being watched all the rime there  do nor actually have to be any guards in the cemral core The prisoners in  essence guard themselves They act as though they are under surveillance  even if there is nobody there to observe them And that Foucault con cludes is our condition Given the suffusion of discipline across broad  swaths of our society we are in a condition of whar he calls panopricism  Even if there is no one watching us even if we are not being monitored we  act as though we are We wonder why we are normal as we mentioned a  moment ago because we are our own prison guards In a society filled with  psychoservices from therap ists to social workers O personnel counsellors  there is no need for everyone to be watched As these services proliferate  most of us will begin to watch ourselves   We saw above that there are some cominuiries between penal d iscip line  and earlier forms of punishmem in particular that both had to do with  penal iry and that both are focused on the body We can see now that the  later forms of each are although cominuous in one sense in another sense  far removed from their earlier versions Penal iry is no longer a project of  punishment It is nor even strictly speaking a project of deterrence It is a  project of normalization of what penal theorists call re habilitation Rather  than vengeance there is care Rather than torture there is d iscip line Those  who currently impugn the prisons for being too soft on prisoners are right  in a sense The project of imprisonmem is no longer one of extracting a  price for an injury against the social body However those cri tics miss the  larger disciplinary whole imo which this softer rearmem firs   The role of the body has changed as we ll It has changed from being a sire  of pain to being a sire of normalization It is the place where our psycho logical stare our normalization is created When Foucault calls his study of  the prisons an elemem in a genealogy of the modern soul DP 29 we  can see why The modern soul is the psychological soul one whose moral  componems are embedded in a logic of rhe normal and the abnormal  We are held in thrall to this modern soul not simply because it is imposed  on us bur because at this particular rime in our history it is who we are  Or better since there is nothing that so lely is who we are it is as Fou cault says an elemem of who we are a cemrally imporram one And  because we are held in thrall to it and because it is one of the crucial  sources of our conformity it is no surprise when Foucault inverting the old  Christian formula declares that the soul is the prson of the body ibid  30   77     THE PHILOSOPHY Of FOUCAULT   O f course as many wi ll point our the prison as a project of rehabilitation  is a failure Recidivism rates are high many prisoners consider the thera peutic aspects of prison a joke and as we have come to understand many  projects of psychological therapy have at best uneven success in changing  attitudes or behaviour The prison as a sire of discipline has nor created the  kind of environment in which discipl ine can rake hold And yet the prison  remains the major response to criminal ity How does Foucault explain  this   He does nor deny the failure of the prison What he seeks to understand  instead is irs continuance in the face of irs failure There must he believes  be some function that prisons continue to serve if demonstrated fai lure is  nor enough to dismantle them In fact there are two one having to do with  prisoners themselves and the other with the society at large Regarding pris oners the prison becomes parr of an entire sysrem where cerrain criminals  who cannor be rehabi litated can at least be monitored Prisons parole  officers police informants all these become reliays in a larger system of  survei llance where criminal ity can be overseen at rimes even uti lized when  it can nor be el iminated T he dream of the early prison reformers or later  of the practitioners of discipline is indeed a d ream There will always  be criminality particularly in societies where goods are as unevenly dis tributed as they are in Western societies Therefore where one can impose  discipline successfully one does Vhere one cannot one uses the same  resources to construct a system of survei llance rhat can at least monitor  what it cannot change   The effects of the prison on the society at large are perhaps more import ant It is nor simply the prison itself bur the larger carceral archipelago  DP 298 composed of social workers psychologists psychiat rists per sonnel counsellors judges the legal system fami ly doctors and others of  which it is a necessary parr T he carceral archipelago generates important  effects on the texture of our society Near the end of Discipline and Punish  Foucault isolates six of those effects The carceral archipelago blurs the line  between the legal and the illegal allowing for conrinuous d isciplinary inter vention It can recruit the delinquents it creates in order to monitor crime  It makes the idea of punishment itself seem natural or inevitable particu larl y since it is done without violence but instead by means of softer d is ciplinary procedures It permits a new form of law one that is no longer  beholden to the binary opposition of the permirred and the forbidden It  allows the proliferation of procedures of examination and normalization  throughout society Finally it reinforces the importance of the prison itself  regardless of its failure as the ultimate and often most th reatening si te of  disciplinary intervention In short the carceral archipelago of which the  prison is a central element sustains the discipl inary character of society   78     GENEALOGICAl HISTORIES OF WHO WE ARE   even when it cannot accomplish the disciplinary project of rehabilitating  criminals   Discipline and Punish is Foucaults most sustained genealogical discus sion of who we are now We can see in it all the e lements of a genealogy  the dispersed character of origins the effects of what N ietzsche would  undoubtedly call reactivity the historical conringency of the unfolding of  practices the lowly character of the practices themselves that wind up con verging to create part of who we are We shall shortly turn to the view of  power that underlies this work a view that receives substantial elaboration  in Foucaults next book the first volume of his history of sexuality Before  that however it would be worth pausing again to ask after the accuracy of  Foucaults history of discipline It is a question that Foucault himse lf recog nizes as legitimate since in that next volume he ra ises it himself Discuss ing his view of power as creative rather than simp ly prohibitive he asks  Beyond these few phosphorescences the suggestive historical changes he  has just d iscussed in regard to sexuality are we not sure to find once more  the somber law that always says no The answer wll have to come our of a  historical inquiry HS 72   Perhaps the most sustained alternative to Foucaults history of the pris ons is Pierer Spierenbergs The Spectacle of Suffering7 Spierenberg sees his  own work as a contrast to Discipline and Punish and writes that his project  is one that attempts to construct a counterparadigm to Foucaults  Along the way Spierenberg makes a number of criticisms of Foucaults  work many of which seem to be based on a misreading of Foucaults book  For instance he writes that Foucault speaks of the political danger imma nent in executions which he considers the real cause of their eventual dis appearance Spierenberg concedes that there is resistance to executions  at rimes bur notes that there is no evidence that rh is alone leads to the end  of public executions As we have seen however Foucault s genealogical  method resists the very idea of a real cause Causality is complex and dis persed and Foucault indicates that the decline of public executions has as  much to do with economic and po litical changes as it does with any resist ance to the practice itsel f   Spierenbergs main thesis however is that Foucault is mistaken to think  that there is a sudden historical break in the areeighteenth and early nineteenth centuries that leads to the demise of torture and the emer gence of discipl ine Using arch ival research nor only from France bur also  from other places in Europe 10 particularly England and the Netherlands  Spierenberg seeks to show that the emergence of the prison is a slower  process occurring over a longer period of rime than Foucault ascribes to it  and that older practices continue to exist alongside the newer disciplinary  practices of the prison The fact that the completion of the privatization   79     THE PHilOSOPHY OF FOUCAULT   of repression rook abour rworh irds of rhe ninereenrh cenrury in most  Vesrern European counrries adds up ro a cri tique of FoucaulTs views  Does ir   First one must concede rhar Foucaul ts research is often cenrered on  France Spierenbergs work like Klaus Doerners on madness draws from  a wider range of counrries Secondly in as much as Foucault ascribes a rad ical break Spierenbergs work would serve as a corrective lr is nor clear  however rhar rhe ascribed break is as radical as Spierenberg makes ir our ro  be In his archaeological period Foucault talks in terms of decisive histor ical disconrinuiries The siruarion is more complicated in rhe genealogical  works Those involve emergences rhar appear more nuanced That there is  sooner or later a new historical siruarion is certainly one of Foucault s  claims Spierenberg does nor deny this However when Spierenberg calls  Foucault a srrucruralisr as he does in rhe rexr he seems robe rhinking  more of rhe approach of some of Foucaults archaeological works rhan his  genealogical ones   For instance when Spierenberg wrires rhar From his srrucruralisr per spective he is describing a sysrem and ir is irrelevanT ro him which particular  poinr in rime one picks ro invesrigare rhar sysrem rhar irrelevance would  app ly more TO an archaeologica l view

discursive rules rhar remains unril a historical break In a genealogical view  however rhe practices rhar converge and diverge do nor necessarily do so  in accordance wirh any larger cui rural or subculrural rhemes Who we are  is nor this ar one rime and that ar another The themes rhar comprise us are  fluid and historically staggered   In thar sense Spierenberg by according as much historical weight ro  what happens ourside of France as wirhin ir helps reinforce the fluid char acter of hisrory in a way that Foucault does nor emphasize in Discipline and  Pzmish Thar would make ir a conrribution ro a genealogical hisrory rather  rhan an undermining of ir The exrenr to which Sp ierenbergs analys is is his torically better than Foucaults is beyond my expertise ro say However as  I menrioned earl ier Foucaults work borh genealogical and archaeological  lies ar the inrersecrion of both philosophy and history We should see his  works then as engaging and open ro borh d isciplines   From rhe philosophical perspective there are severa l novel conrriburions  of Discipline and Punish Ir questions a progressive view of hisrory wirhour  embracing a regressive one lr inverrs rhe rrad

change rather than being immutable and if that his torical change is contingent then our history cannot be one of necessary  progress or regress Or again if knowledge is a matter of politics then the  Christian heritage of the privileging of the soul over the body can come into  question not only epistemologically but also politically   Underlying all of these contributions is another one Utilized in the book  on the prisons and explained in the first volume of his history of sexual ity  is a new view of the operation of power It is not that all of these other  changes are reducible to this new view of power Rather it is that they all  appeal to it moreover it gives each of them a force they would lack with out it At a first go we might say that for Foucault power acts as much as or  more through what it creates than through what it represses   There is a traditional view of power that informs almost all po litical  though t It can be seen particularly in the liberal tradition of political ph ilo sophy The view is rhar power works primari ly if nor solely by stopping  certain things from happening Here is a rough sketch In the social con traer ind ividuals give up certain of their freedoms to the stare In this way  the stare becomes extraordinarily powerful lr can intervene in peoples  lives in order ro prevenr them from do ing all sorts of things There must  then be checks placed upon the state Those checks prevent rhe stare from  overstepping its legitimate bounds The checks can be internal to the state  for instance a separation of powers of the kind the US Constirution pro vides they can also be external for instance in limiting the powers of the  state to dominate public discussion as in freedom of the press finally they  can be a combination of the rwo However these checks work they must  allow individuals to be able to conduct their lives with the protection and  support of but nor rhe undue interference by the state   This brief admittedly inadequate sketch of liberal political phi losophy is  meant ro illuminate rwo related themes rhar characterize rhar phi losophy  the centrality of the stare and the negative view of power rhar is the view  of power as repressive These themes lean upon each other If we look ar  power from the standpoinr of the state we are likely ro see something large  imposing and repressive Power is what stares have that can inrerfere with  the ability of individuals to carry out their lives Think of the mi litary the  police prisons From the other side if we look ar rhe state from the stand point of a repressive or negative power we are likely to see something  monolithic that needs to be curbed so that it does not become tyrannical   But suppose we approach power in a different fashion Suppose we turn  away from the state and look closer to the ground ar our everyday practices  Suppose we rake a genealogical turn and ask Where and how does a par t icular form of power arise instead of the liberal question of Who has   81     THE PHilOSOPHY OF FOUCAULT   power In rhar case power can appear very differently from the way ir  does in liberal theory This is nor TO say rhar Foucault denies rhar there is  such a thing as repressive power or rhar rhe stare possesses ir This is a com mon misreading of his work Rather ir is ro say that ofren rhe more effec tive forms of power come from below rather than above from our practices  rather than from rhe stare lr is also TO say rhar this often more effective  power operates by creating objects rather than by repressing them   lr should be emphasized here rhar rhe emergence of this form of power is  itself a historical marrer Ir relies on more advanced techno logies of com munication more dominanr population cenrres such as cities rhe rise of  medical and related health sciences and greater economic inregration   I f ir is true rhar rhe juridical system rhe binary system of rhe per mined and the forbidden with irs repressive view of power was  useful for represenring albeit in a nonexhaustive way a power rhar  was cen tered primarily around deduction prelevement and death  ir is utterly incongruous with the new methods of power whose  operation is nor ensured by r ight but by technique not by law but  by normalization nor by punishmenT but by conrrol methods rhar  are employed on all levels and in forms that go beyond the stare  and its apparatus HS 89 u   If creative forms of power are at one rime marginal they are now cenrral in  the practices in which we engage and through which we become who we  are who we are now   If we are ro deepen our understanding we musr ask two questions what  does Foucault mean by power and how does ir work T he first quest ion is  one rhar Foucaul t mostly avoids He does nor he tells us wanr to give us a  theory of power but rather to describe its operation in particular historical  situations Nevertheless using the term as cenrrally as he does he must  have something in mind And in an essay enritled The Subject and Power  he does offer a renrative defini tion of power   In effect what defines a relationship of power is rhar ir is a mode  of action which does nor act directly and immediately on others  Instead ir acts upon their actions an action upon an action on  exist ing actions or on rhose which may arise in rhe presenr or rhe  future SP 220   Foucaul t conrrasrs power and violence Violence forces a body ro do  something it compels without the possibility of resistance Power on the  other hand works by what we migh t call influence instead of violence Ir   82     GENEALOGICAl HISTORIES OF WHO WE ARE   works nor by rescrainr bm by inducing something to happen This is why  Foucault says Power is exercised only over free subjects and only insofar  as they are free ibid 221 Power works by taking an open field of pos sible actions and constructing certain pathways of actions that are more  likely co be taken Normalization for instance does nor work by violence  upon rhe body bm rather by observ ing and examining a body and lead ing ic  co become more efficiem   There is a kinship between chis definition of power and rhe hiscorical  comingency to which Foucault is committed If power works by influenc ing or by inducing a free body rather chan by force then its ho ld is more  fragile chan we might otherwise chink Although normalization lies deeply  embedded in our concepcion of who we are ic does so only by means of irs  influence and by irs inherence in so many of our practices T here are ocher  ways we can be ways that can be explored through the construction of new  practices Vho we are now is historically comingem   If chis is Foucaults view of what power is how does ic work Yhac can  we say abom the ways power relations in fluence or induce our behaviour  In the first volume of his history of sexual icy Foucault offers what might  be cal led his five theses on power power is nor a possession power is nor  exterior co ocher relations power comes from below power relations are   imemional and nonsubjeccive power always comes with resistance  HS 94 5 lr is worth pausing over each of these t heses   To chink of power as a possession is to think in accordance with the t radi t ional view of power lr is co seek co understand and regulate the enricy  usually the scare that has rhe most of it  Bm power can work wichom be longing co anybody Actions can const rain other actions without any bodys  possessing rhe power of char conscraim Tuke and Pinel for instance pos sess no power over the mad T heir imervemions are merely expressions of  discursive and practical regularities But chose imervemions actions upon  actions help co create and sustain a new type of bondage of the mad In the  terms we have been using their imervemions help make the mad who they  were to become Or again chose who work in the medical field or who  reach or who engage in psychotherapy do nor have the power of d iscip line  over chose they monitor or supervise Rather they are in a relation with  chose ochers char is itself one of discipline Normal izacion is nor something  they impose but instead something in which they participate   To say that power is nor exterior co ocher relations is to generalize rhe  lesson of power knowledge Knowledge is nor in a relation of exterioriry  co power Neither is health psychotherapy penal icy or as we shall shordy  see sex Ve muse be carefu l here though As we saw with knowledge co  say char ocher relations are nor immune co power is nor the same thing as  saying char they are all reducible co power char they are really about   83     THE PHilOSOPHY OF FOUCAULT   power Power is interwoven into these and other practices in complex  ways If one is to understand the operation of power within them it re quires a patient historical analysis of the way power arises within and across  practices nor a sweeping general ization about everything being simply a  marrer of power   This is in parr because power comes from below Power in the sense  Foucault approaches ir is nor a possession of rhe stare a marrer of the  economy or the expression of some overarching historical theme It lies in  the dispersion of everyday practices that are the aerher of our lives In my  rais ing of my children in the postal workers interact ion wi th customers  in the warden s observation of prisoners in the holidaymakers choice of  hotels there is power I r is nor a power that one possesses over another  there may be that roo bur that is nor what Foucault is gerring at  rather  it is a power that lies in the practices itself creating who we are through  our participation in them We would of course refuse to say that all of  these practices are nothing bur power at work To say that would be at best  silly probably meaningless There is more going on in what we do every  day than merely power And that would be Foucaults point Power is  everywhere to be sure bur this does nor mean that power is everything  The point that power comes from below from w hat Foucaul t sometimes  calls the capillaries reinforces that point   Foucaults phrase that power relations are  intentional and nonsubjecrive  has often been misunderstood It sounds as though there is a certain goal that  power has in mind even if that goal is nor the motivation of particular  ind ividuals Foucaults choice of words may reinforce this view  There is  no power that is exercised wi thout a series of aims and objectives Bur this  does nor mean that it results from the choice or decision of an ind ividual  subject HS 95 We need nor however read any anthropomorph izing  of power here Power relations themselves do not want or aim at or seek  to ach ieve anything We might berrer understand the idea if we use the  term oriented Power relations are oriented in certain directions They have  regu larities that conduce to some kinds of behaviour and nor others   Discipline involves a set of power relations that are oriented Histor ically a dispersion of practices  or at least elements of those practices   come together to induce individuals to become normalized and insepar ably to think of themselves in terms of normalization This orientation is  nor the aim or goa l of anything It is the product of various intersections  and borrowings in a particular historical context and with a recogn izable  set of consequences It is the task of a genealogy ro trace those intersections  and borrowings and to describe their consequences T he orientation of  intersections borrowings and consequences is what Foucault refers to with  the term intentional   84     GENEALOGICAL HISTORIES OF WHO WE ARE   The idea that Where there is power there is resistance ibid is an elu sive one It can be taken in at least rwo d ifferent ways The first way would  be to claim that in principle power requ ires resistance There can be no  power without resistance I am uncomfortable with this claim If power  is a set of actions upon actions that create objects in the way Foucault  describes it does nor seem necessary ro think of resistance as an inevitable  parr of power relations Since force is nor involved could there nor be  relations of power that are without resistance There is reason to think  otherwise However we might understand this fifth thesis in a weaker  sense It is nor rhar power relations require resistance and cannot exist  without ir bur rather that there always seems to be resistance where there  are relations of power In other words power does nor imply resistance  bur often comes coupled with ir This seems a muclh more defensible claim  justifying ir is a matter of turning ro the historical record And indeed  Foucault shows in Discipline and Punish rhar various power arrangements  have been mer with resistance even if those resisri ng do nor know exacrly  what it is they are opposing For instance near the end of the book  Foucault describes the criticism of penal discipline in workers newspapers  of the nineteenth century showing how they have an intu ition of the stakes  of discipline without a nuanced grasp of irs operation   These fives theses amount to a view of a type of power that does nor  merely suppress or repress bur rhar actively creates  W ithout anyones con trolling ir power arises in everyday practices orienting our behaviour and  our knowledge in particular historically contingent ways Ye rarely under stand these ways fu lly bur often rry ro resist them And by our partici pating in these practices we ourselves become embedded in relations of  power even when we resist them Ye become what those relations orient  us to become and we pave the way for others to become it as well To pur  the point another way power helps create who we are or at least who we  are now Recall here Foucaults earlier statement that we often know what  we do and why we are doing it what we do nor know is what our doing it  does What our doing it does is reinforce power relations rhar elude our  cogni tive grasp nor because we are d istant from them bur for the opposite  reason that they are so much a parr of who we are It is the project of a  genealogy ro display those relations before us in their proximity their com plexity and their historical contingency   A history of sexuality   The first volume of Foucaul ts history of sexuality sketches another genea logical project this one tied ro sex rather than discipline Although the next   85     THE PHilOSOPHY O f FOUCAULT   and lasr rwo published volumes of rhe history of sexuality rake on a d iffer em approach from rhe one outlined in rhe first volume rhe historical sketch  Foucault offers there has been as influential as his book on rhe prisons in  parr because ir invites a radical reorientation of how we rhink abour sex   The History of Sexuality Volume I is published in 1976 a year after rhe  book on rhe prisons lr announces and sketches a project on sexuality rhar  appears less radical now rhan ir does ar thar rime in parr because we no  longer live at a moment we would be rempred ro call one of sexual libera tion In rhe rhirry years since rhe publication of rhis book much of whar  seems novel rhen is now a matter of course If anything our sexual practices  are a subject o f arrack from rhe right rather rhan as ir appears rhen a  provocation by rhe left   At rhe beginning of rhe book on sexuality Foucault describes our rhen  current view of sex under rhe rerm rhe repressive hypothesis The repressive  hypothesis is a story abour our sexuality lr is a srory of sexual awakening  Once we were sexual ly repressed This sexual repression which has long  been wirh us perhaps achieves irs zenith in rhe Victorian period bur has  been sustained rhroughour much of rhe rwenrierh century Wirh rhe vari ous movements for liberation in rhe 1960s and here recall rhe evenrs o f  May 68 rhe recognition of rhe need for sexual liberation arises Sexual  repression after all is nor only bad in itself ir also conrribures to other  ills includ ing rhe repression of womens sexuality discrimination against  homosexuality a general cul rural conformism and rhe suppress ion of  other desires Now in rhe period of rhe late 1960s and early 1970s we  have liberated our sexuality and wi rh rhar liberation have opened the door  ro or her liberations from rhe constraints of bourgeois society   There is more rhan a little in fluence of psychoanalytic rhoughr in rhe  repressive hy pothesis The rheme o f sexual repression rhe idea rhar such  repression is linked to other social phenomena  in particular rhe sus raining of bourgeois society  and rhe focus on desire are all legacies of  psychoanalysis   In rhe United Stares and Britain where psychoanalysis has always been  less influential rhan during rhese years in France rhe possibility o f a psycho analytic background to rhe repressive hypothesis may seem to be strained  However ir does find irs way inro Anglophone countries through such  works as Herbert Marcuses Eros and Civilization In France rhe rise of  psychoanalytic rhoughr under rhe influence of Jacques Lacan makes ir dur ing rhis period almost de rigueur for leftists ro appropriate psychoanalytic  elements inro progressive theory Perhaps rhe mosr lasting of rhese works is  Deleuze and Guattaris AntiOedipus a book rhar rejects psychoanalysis  bur which on rhe other hand appropriates and reworks a Lacanian con cept o f desire   86     GENEALOGICAl HISTORIES OF WHO WE ARE   There are many questions one might put to the repressive hypothesis  Have we really liberated ourselves from sexual repression If so has this  indeed led us to other forms of liberation Hasnt sexual liberation simply  been appropriated by capital ism to open up new products and new types of  marketing Foucault however follows a different path He asks a question  that casts doubt on the founding assumptions of these other questions Has  there ever been he wonders such a thing as sexual repression If there  hasnt then not only could we not have liberated ourselves from it we can not wonder what effects this liberation might or might not have had   It wou ld seem odd to say that there has never been anyth ing like sexual  repression Does the Victorian period not exhibit much greater discretion  about sexual issues than we do Hasnt the open discussion of sex long been  a taboo subject To say that there never was sexual repression however is  not the same thing as saying that there was never any discretion in regard to  sexual matters   It is quite possible that there was an expurgation  and a very rigor ous one  of the au thorized vocabulary It may be true that a whole  rhetoric of allusion and metaphor was codified  At the level of  discourses and their domains however practically the opposite  phenomenon occurred There was a steady proliferation of dis courses concerned with sex HS 1718   Discourse on sex in periods previous to our own is discreet to be sure but  it is also pervasive   How does this concern with sex arise In accord ance with genealogical  practice Foucault finds its roots not in a single cause but in the convergence  of disparate concerns One of them has to do with the Catholic confes sional In the face o f the Reformation the confessional undergoes a change  Where previously one confesses forbidden acts now one must confess not  on ly the acts that one commits but also ones desires It is not simply what  one does that is the object of confessional it is what one thinks and wants  especially with regard to sex   According to the new pastoral sex must not be named imprud ently but its aspects its correlations and its effects must be  pursued down to their slenderest ramifications a shadow in a day dream an image too slowly d ispelled a badly exorcised complicity  between the bodys mechanics and the minds complacency every thing had to be told Ibid 19   If we recall the project o f norma lization from Discipline and Punish we can  see here the change from a binary logic of the pennitted and the forbidden  to a wider logic of the normal and the abnormal   87     THE PHilOSOPHY O f FOUCAULT   In addition to changes in the confessional there is an economic focus on  sex The beginnings of an industrial economy raise questions about how  populations are to be sustained and utilized   One of the great innovations in the techniques o f power in the  eighteenth century was the emergence of population as an eco nomic and po litical problem population as wealth population as  manpower or labor capacity population balanced between irs own  growth and the resources it commanded Ibid 25   Vhere there is concern with population there w ill also be concern with  sex how it happens what it leads to and how it should be regulated   There are other sources as well in biology in medicine in psychology in  pedagogy In schools for instance whi le sex is nor spoken of the architec ture of dormitories disp lays a greater concern with the partitions dividing  boys and girls What these various sources converge on is sex Sex as the  centrepiece sex as the object sex as the secret and ultimately sex as the  truth In d irect contrast ro the repressive hypothesis sex is nor something  hidden that has just come to ligh t What is peculiar to modern societies in  fact is not that they consigned sex to a shadow existence bur rhar they  dedicated themselves to speaking of it ad infinitum whi le exploi ting it as  the secret ibid 35 In this sense the sexual liberation of the period in  which Foucault writes is not a break from the past it is simply a continu ation of the concern with sex that has characrerzed the West for several  hundred years Moreover psychoanalysis wh ich frames the repressive  hypothesis is far from being an abandonment of rel igion in favour of  something more progressive or better grounded epistemologically It is  instead a form of the confessional carried on by other means   Sex is our truth in our sexual desire we discover the secret of who we are  and the key to proper social regu lation Over the course of the past several  cenmries sex has become one of the key pivots about which the answer  to the question of who we are revo lves And because power is insepar able from knowledge the investigation of sex is a political as well as an  episremic one T hat investigation is nor only a maner of discovery It is also  a matter of actions upon actions that create what is investigated Both in the  empirical and theoretical research into sex as welll as the individual confes sion of ones desires  to the priest to the psychoanalyst to the counsellor  or social worker  one is being studied and created Practices that centre on  sex are creating a sexual being or better d ifferent types of beings that are  defining themselves by their relation to sex   Foucault suggests four figures that arise from the concern with sex  They are elements of the creation as he puts ir of sexuality as a historical   88     GENEALOGICAl HISTORIES OF WHO WE ARE   phenomenon our of sex These figures are the hysterical woman the mas mrbaring ch ild the perverse adult and the Malthusian couple The hyster ical woman has her roots in earl ier views of sex The idea of hysteria comes  from the movement of the womb around the womans body The Greek  term hysterikos means womb T his theme is appropriated over the course  of the nineteenth century to link women and their nervous conditions to  sexuality Sex is the truth of the hysterical woman who is to be found in  almost all women   The masturbating child is the product of the d iscovery of the sexual  character of ch ildhood T he chi ld once though t to be presexual is now  thought and feared to be saturated with sexuality from an early age The  question arises of what to do with this newly d iscovered sexual character of  children In one of the recently published series of necrures from Foucaults  tenu re at the College de France Abnormal Foucault documents measures  used to channel ch ildhood sexuality measures that find their root in a pro fusion of texts from the middle of the eighteenth century on the dangers of  childhood masmrbarion In essence at least for bourgeois fami lies there  emerges a fear of outside caretakers as potential sexual abusers provoking  masturbation in ch ildren T his leads to a privileging of the nuclear fam ily as  the necessary condition for healthy ch ildhood sexuality and consequently  to the responsibility of the parents for a childs sexual upbringing The  childs sexuality is the trick by which the closeknit affective substantial  and cellu lar fam ily was constituted and from whose shelter the child was  extracted ALCF 257 15   The perverse adult is exemplified of course by the homosexual Homo sexuals are defined  and to this day remain defined  by their sexuality It is  the key to who they are T his does nor mean that homosexuality itself is a  matter of sex that is an obvious truth  It means that homosexuals them selves as people are defined by their sexuality W ho they are can be discov ered through an investigation of their sexual desires As Foucault sums it up   the sexual instinct was isolated as a separate biological and psych i cal instinct a clinical analysis was made of all the forms of anoma lies by which it could be afflicted it was assigned a role of  normalization or parhologization wi th respect to all behavior and  finally a corrective technology was sought for these anomal ies   HS 105   The perverse adult is the person defined by a warp ing of sexual desire That  warping fu lfi ls two roles First it warrants intervention by various psycho logical and social agencies Secondly since this waping is a possibility that  can befall all sexual desire it stands as a possibi lity for each of us We must   89     THE PHilOSOPHY Of FOUCAULT   al l be protected nor only against perverse adu lts themselves bur also  against rhe perverse adul t rhar lies in wait wirhin each of us One can see  here rhe soi l wirhin which Freudian psychoanalysis will rake roar   Finally rhere is rhe Malthusian couple This is rhe couple rhar is ideal  relative ro the social and economic needs of society It is a product of popu lation analysis and psychosexual research We might say in rhe terms intra  duced in Discipline and Punish rhar the Malrhusuan couple is the norm as  in normal against wh ich all existing fam ilies are compared And since  nobody or almost nobody ach ieves perfect normality the Malthusian  couple becomes the justification for intervention into peoples sexual lives  We all exist both in the shadow of and at a d isrance from rhe ideal of the  Malthusian couple which in turn provides both an ideal for us ro achieve  and the excuse for outside institutions ro monitor and control our sexual  lives or otherwise pur ro rake parr in the consriturion of and intervention  into who we are   In rhe final chapter of the first volume of his history of sexua liry Fou  caulr suggests rhar the sexual ity rhar emerges over the course of rhe eight eenth and nineteenth centuries is parr of a larger configuration rhat he  rerms biopolitics Biopolirics is a politics of living rhar concerns itself wirh  how to promote and intervene in human life It replaces the earl ier concern  with simply allowing one to live with an active intervention into the charac ter and srare of ones living One might say that the ancient righ t ro take  life or let live was replaced by a power ro foster life or disallow ir ro the  point of death HS 138 We must be clear here rhar the power rhar re places that ancient right does nor belong solely or even primari ly ro the  stare It arises as a more diffuse mechanism of power relations rhar come  from d ispersed sources and converge in a fluid and shift ing unity The fos tering or disallowing of life is a decision that is rarely made in the name of  or by means of a central government It emerges in schools hospitals social  agencies cl inics doctors offices health manuals and a myriad of other  places whose decisions may resonate with one another bur do nor arise  from a central core   With the concept of biopolirics Foucault returns ro and integrates his  ea rlier treatment of discipl ine He suggests rhar discipline may be one of the  rwin poles of the consrirurion of biopo lirics   starring in rhe seventeenth century this power over life evolved in  rwo basic forms    One of these poles   was ensured by the pro  cedures of power that characterized the disciplines an anatamo politics of the human bod The second somewhat larer focused  on rhe species body the body imbued with the mechanisms of  life and serving as the basis of the biological processes   T heir   90     GENEALOGICAl HISTORIES OF WHO WE ARE   supervision was effected through an enrire series of inrervenrions  and regulatory controls a biopolitics of the population HS 139   Discip line and population the individual body and the co llective group  T hese are the po les of biopo lirics What do the body and population have  in common Sexual iry   Sexualiry then can be read back inro some of the concerns developed in  the earlier book on the prisons T his does nor mean rhar the earlier book is  mistaken rhar the issue is really sex nor discipl ine The suggestion rather is  that the concern with sex brings a new dimension to the discipl inary inter ventions described in the earlier text Ye can see the ove rlap between the  two the focus on normality and normalization the concern with a persons  interioriry the soul in one case desire in the other the connection with  psychological and psychiatric practice During this period of his writing  Foucault often says that his concern is with what he calls in a play on  words subjectification or stbjectivation the creation of particular kinds  of subjectivity through the subjection to various practices of power knowledge What the books on discipl ine and sex accomplish is to describe  from two different bur convergenr angles the emergence of modern sub jecriviry In that sense these books reflect the genealogical method itself  Just as each describes dispersed sources of the un ities of who we are they  are themselves dispersed sources in that history Taken together they  account for two of the most important dispersions that form the historic ally contingenr sources for who we are now   Before turn ing to Foucaults last works and the concerns they ra ise it  remains for us to ask how the genealogical works we have d iscussed here fit  with the five aspects of Foucaults writings cited in the first chapter and  how they compare on these counrs wi th the archaeological writings The  first aspect is that of our collective constitution One can see that aspect at  work in the genealogical writings perhaps even more clearly than in the  archaeo logical ones Although both sets of works operate at the level of  social practices rather than the individuals creation of themselves the  genealogical works show how this collective constitution arises on an  everyday level Because the genea logical works are less abstracted from  our daily lives they show how a we or a group olf differenr bur overlapp ing wes arises not by imposition from instinttions or forces above us bur  from below where we live   Earlier we saw that the archaeological works although recognizing  relations between the d iscursive and nondiscursive elements of an arch ive  seem to privilege the former T his privi lege disappears in the genealo gical works in part because the distinction between the discursive and  nondiscursive itself disappears Since Foucault is concerned less with the   91     THE PHilOSOPHY O f FOUCAULT   archival shape of theoretical d iscourses and more with how particular  discourses of knowledge arise within concrete social practices the issue  shifts It is no longer a matter of the relation of the discursive to the non discursive It is one of how practices create forms of knowledge Vhen one  discusses a practice one need not draw sharp d istinctions between the dis cursive and the nondiscursive elements because at the level of a practice  they are entwined Vhat we think we know and what we do are in constant  interaction and in fact bleed into each other By focusing on practices  rather than on bodies of knowledge one can recognize this more clearly   We can see this for example with the emergence of the four figures  of sexual ity or of the selfmon itoring citizen of the disciplinary archipelago  In both cases the way one knows and the way one is and behaves are  entwined Our knowledge creates who we are and who we are in our  relarionshi ps of power helps to create our knowledge This of course is  another of the five characteristics of Foucaults works the close relation ship of acting and knowing Genealogys focus on practices as well as  the introduction of powerknowledge creates a type of analysis that  renders the discursive and the nondiscursive inseparable At the same rime  because these practices are social they form the collective character of  who vre are   This collective and pol itically charged character of who we are is at once  historically contingent and something we cannot just shake off The histor ical contingency is as strong here as it is in the archaeological works but for  a different reason In the earl ier writings the fragility of our history is dis played in the breaks and discontinuities it contains Different arch ives are  governed by different rules and norms and there are often shifts from one  arch ive to another T his shifting of archi ves blunts the force of any claim that  history follows necessary movement or has a single underlying theme In the  genealogical works it is nor so much the discontinuities that matteralthough  they are there  but rather the sh ifting and changing character of the prac tices themselves as well as their complex interplay with one another 16   T here is no necessary reason that sex should become so important to  who we are now any more than breathing or eat ing The intersection of a  changed Cathol ic confessional and the rise of population studies for exam ple cannot be ascribed to an underlying movement of history that they  both reflect T he Reformation does not have to ralke place in the way and at  the rime it does and even if it had to Catholicism does nor need to respond  to it by focusing the confessional on sexual desires rather than forbidden  acts At the same rime the rise of early capitalism does nor require the  emergence and importance of population studies Capitalism could be  studied and supported through other types of ep istemological approaches  Further the crossfertilization of the modified confessional and population   92     GENEALOGICAL HISTORIES OF WHO WE ARE   studies does nor have to centre itself on a historically constituted sexual ity  Even if both refer rosex they do so in d ifferent ways There is no historical  inevitability to their coming together to form a unury   Ye can see this historical contingency more clearly through the derailed  approach of genealogy than through a more broadbrushsrroke painting  of history and historical change Recall Foucaults depiction of genealogy  grey meticu lous and patien tly documentary From a great distance or  height our history may seem to have a necessary shape or pattern How ever when one begins to look at the complexity of our actual practices  when one approaches our lives at ground level the contingency of those  practices emergence and interaction becomes more visible   At the same rime and on the other hand the uniti es that emerge through  the contingent threads of our history fragile as they are are nor simply to  be shaken off Ye have seen that in the archaeological histories the fact that  action rakes place in an arch ive means that actions are framed by their his torical circumstances Tuke and Pinel cannot just do and say anything they  like what they do and say is both constrained by and rakes on irs meaning  through the circumstances in which it is done and said The genealogical  works are no different in this regard However by introducing the concept  of power Foucaults genealogies are more expl icit about the constra ining  nature of our practices Actions that affect other act ions are inescapably ac tions that we cannot simply shake off One need not embrace a conspiracy  theory of history to recognize that who we are is subject to force or elements  or relationships that to a greater or lesser extent are our of our control   This does nor imply as some of Foucaults critics have maintained that  we are helpless before our historical constitution that we are nothing more  than the machinations of power re lationsh ips Ye have already seen that  the claim that power is everywhere does nor imply that it is everything One  of the difficulties in understanding Foucaults work is that of thinking of  contingency and constraint roger her This is nor a d ifficulty that belongs to  some abstract or elusive facer of Foucaults work It is just something we are  nor used to Our intellecruallegacy largely provides us with rwo options  either we are free or we are determined Or if we are more nuanced about  it we have our areas of freedom and our areas of determination The for mer is an open space untouched by the causal relationships of the world  The latter is completely subject to those causal relationsh ips   Foucaults histories do nor subscribe to this view There is no parr of us  that is immune to the vicissirudes of our history And yet those vicissirudes  are nor made of iron They are fragi le contingent changeable Foucault as  we have seen does nor give us a solution to the philosophical problem of  free will and determinism Moreover his approach implies a different ori entation to the issue of constraint There is then no reason to saddle him   93     THE PHILOSOPHY Of FOUCAULT   with a view he does nor hold in the name of a theoretical approach that is  nor his   There remains the characteristic of complexily Genealogy leaves the  ambiguity of archaeologys relation to complexity behind Foucaults  archaeological studies trace the rules and norms o f particular archives This  leaves open the question of how general the arcl ive is Does it range over  an entire cu ltural formation or is ir more limited  If ir is the former then  historical formations are less complex than if there are d ifferent arch ives  governing d ifferent areas of a society or a cu lture Is ordered representa tion or reason s treatment of madness as folly a deep characteristic of the  classical age Do these aspects of the classical age describe that age in irs  entirety Or are they aspects or parts or areas of the ep istemological struc ture of the later seventeenth and eigh teenth centuries Migh t there be other  knowledges outside those of the theories of value living beings and  language that are nor oriented around ordered representation Might the  particular type of reason that engages with madness be only one way in  which reason operates T hese are questions that are ultimately unresolved  in Foucaults archaeological works   Nor so wi th genealogy Although there are ri mes when Foucault may  seem ro suggest a reduction of cu ltural complexity ro single themes some  for instance have read his concept of the carceral arch ipelago to ind icate  rhar the essence of modernity is carceral a carefu l read ing shows that each  book treats an aspect of how we have come to be who we are now nor the  entirety of it Are we disciplinary beings Yes Are we sexual beings Yes Is  there a relation between these rwo Yes Are they reducible to each other or  to a third unity that encompasses them both No Foucaults genealogical  works even more insistently than his archaeologies resist the temptation  of much of trad itional philosophy of the ph ilosophy that runs from  Descartes through ro Freud and Sarrre to discover the essential core of  who we are and to see the rest of who we are as expressions of that core   There are certainly more important aspects of who we are now and  sexual ity and discipline are among them Nor every aspect of who we have  come robe is an equa lly significant contributor ro rhar being We must nor  rake the lesson of this however to be that there are one or rwo aspects of  who we are now that are the essential ones The complexity of Foucaults  approach lies in carving a path between posing an essential ahisrorical core  of who we are and counting all aspects of our legacy as equally worthy of  discussion   T here is another question that remains one we have posed to the  archaeological writings The archaeologies are haunted by a question of re flexivity a question having to do with their epistemological status VIe can  summarize the question this way if all knowledge takes place in an archive   94     GENEALOGICAL HISTORIES OF WHO WE ARE   does this nor also app ly ro Foucaults archaeologies and if so does that nor  somehow undermine their claims However we answer this question with  regard to archaeology it is nor a question genealogy must confront The  reason for this has to do with genealogys re lation to complexity If there  are many different and irreducible practices in which we are or could be  engaged we can count genealogy itself as one of them Genealogy has irs  own norms and power relations ro be sure bur this does nor necessarily  undermine the historical claims it makes Foucault underlines this point  when in an interview in 1983 he responds to a question about his treat ment of reason by saying   I think that the blackmail which has very ofren been at work in  every critique of reason or every critical inqu iry into the history of  rationality either you accept rationality or you fall prey to the irra t ional operates as though a rational critique of rationality were  impossible or as though rational history of all of rhe ramifications  and all the bifurcations a contingent history of reason were  impossible CT IH 27 17   Recall how genealogy operates in the critique of psychology that arises  in the book on the prisons Foucault does nor criticize psychological know ledge for being fa lse In fact parr of irs t ruth lies in the fact that it contrib utes to creating what it studies The problem with psychological knowledge  lies in irs effects nor irs truth in the political character of what it creates  rather than in the episremic character of irs claims With genealogy then if  we were to ask genealogical questions about its claims if we were to do a  genealogy of genealogy or a genealogy of a parricullar genealogy we would  trace the emergence and descent of that genealogy asking where it comes  from and what the endorsement of it leads to There is no bar ro doing this  as long as one is willing to perform the spade work T hat is one cannot just  say that genealogy has effects of power that are unacceptable or intolerable  One must show it one must investigate the history itself Recall Foucaults  caveat with his own history of sexual ity he does nor yet know whether  beyond these few phosophorescences he will discover that the repressive  hypothesis is indeed correct It will require historical research to determine  T he same holds for genealogy   Genealogy then does nor face the problem of reflexivity that haunts  archaeo logy because it does nor reduce knowledge to a particular archive  and because it does nor claim that the objects of its critique are false It is  open to critique itself bur that critique must be shown nor just claimed  A critique of a Foucauldian genealogy if it is to be compelling must itse lf  be grey metiwlous and patiently documentary   95     CHAPTER FOUR   Who we are and who we might be   The Archaeology of Knowledge is published in 1969 Between 1961 and  1969 Foucault publishes six books He does nor publish another one until  the first genealogy appears in 1975 followed by the first volume of the his tory of sexuality a year later By then there are new themes such as power  and a new methodo logy that of genea logy The first volume on sex prom ises several more to follow   The domain we must analyze in the different studies that will  follow the present volume is that deployment of sexual ity irs  formation on the basis of the Christian notion of the flesh and irs  development through the four great strategies that were deployed  in the nineteenth century the sexual ization of ch ildren the  hysrerizarion of women the specification o f the perverted and  the regulation of populations HS 113  14   In 1984 the second and third volumes are published They appear just  before Foucaults death And in them there are new themes a new chrono logy and a new approach an approach that Foucaul t sometimes labels  ethics   Ethics   We already know that Foucault is resistant to pa1iroll ing the same intellec tual territory He has to ld us in The Archaeology of Knowledge that it is nor  for him to keep his papers in order bur for bureaucrats and the police He  says much the same thing in his preface to the second volume of the history  of sexuality The Use of Pleasure when he tells us that what motivated him   96     WHO WE ARE AND WHO WE MIGHT BE   is a curiosity that al lows him to stray afield of himself We shall ask more  about the character of this straying later For now it is enough that we nor  demand of him that he keep to the original schedule of announced works  In the meantime between the publication of the first volume of the history  of sexuality and the latter two volumes the evidence of a change in orienta t ion appears in his annual lecture series at the Col lege de France   Instead of beginning the investigation in the period of the Renaissance or  postRenaissance a period that has always been Foucaults starring point  Foucault turns his attention to ancient Greece and Rome The 1979 80 lec tures series On the Government of the Living discusses the theme of  governmentality a prominent theme of the next chapter of this book as he  finds it in early Chrisrian iry Bur the real break appears the next year in a  series of lectures entitled Subjectivity and Truth  It is in those lectures  wh ich are the basis for the third volume of the history of sexual iry that he  develops the theme that will occupy the eth ical period of his thought the  care of the self   The care of the self involves several changes to the project on sexual iry  First irs concern is nor simply with sex This should nor be surprising given  the thesis of the first vo lume that sexuality as the placement of sexual desire  at the centre of who one is has evolved over recent centuries Sexualiry is nor  an eternal phenomenon By returning to ancient Greece and Rome Foucault  shows us a period in which sex is conceived d ifferently from the way it is  now It is more integrated into other aspects of living Instead of ho ld ing the  secret to who we are sex is a parr of ones living For the ancients it is an  aspect that is to be taken up into the larger project of taking care of oneself   This first change is related to a second one In Foucaults previous works  he traces aspects of the history of how we have come to be who we are now  He starts with historical periods before our own in order to show in the  archaeo logical works the ruptures that have taken place and in the genea logical works the contingent emergence of our own situation from a very  different one We might say that the history he recounts allows him to do  two things one that we have focused on and another that we have nor ie  have focused on the contingency of historical emergence We have nor  focused on the related idea that people can conceive the world very differ ently from the way we do now That history did nor have to rake the path  it has should by now be a fami liar Foucauldian id ea In tracing that path  we have also seen that the stops along rhe way whether they are archives  or earlier arrangements of practices invo lve very different approaches to  things like madness and punishment than our own    W hy might this matter Of course one might say people saw things dif ferently in earlier periods What is the lesson o f that The lesson emerges  when we combine that idea wi th the recognition that the way people see   97     THE PHilOSOPHY O f FOUCAULT   things and indeed the way people are is historically contingent If we do  nor have to see things the way we once did if we d o nor have to be who we  once were then we do nor have to be who we are now Bringing into focus  different ways of being allows us nor only ro see the contingency of our own  historically given ways of being it allows us to feel ir Being brought into  the presence of another way of living getting a sense of irs themes irs para meters irs concerns allows us to understand more viscerally that there are  indeed other ways to live than our own T his does nor mean we have to  embrace those other ways Bur they can help loosen the grip of naturalness  that the present has upon us   The loosening of this grip is in evidence in the latter rwo volumes on  sexual ity If their goal is to permit our straying afield of ourselves then see ing how we could have lived otherwise is a tool in this permission We  should distinguish this tool from another one that is sometimes mistaken  for Foucaults intention Foucault does not offer us the latter two volumes  of the history of sexual ity in order to provide models for our own living lr  is sometimes though t that the sympathy with which he writes particularly  of Greek sexual ity implies that he wants us to return to it  I suspect that this  view arises largely because of the intersection of Foucaul ts homosexual ity  with the Greeks tolerance for it In an exchange in an interview from 1983  Foucault makes it clear that the Greeks do nor provide a model for him Q  Do you think that the Greeks offer an attractive and plausible alternative  MF No I am not looking for an al ternative yon cant find the so lution of  a problem in the solution at another moment by other people OGE 343   If Foucaults later studies focus on a different view of the role of sex from  our own and if they seek to loosen the grip our own views have on us by  immersing us in another view then this implies a third change a shift in  orientation in Foucaults thought Up until now we have said that the ques tion that occupies Foucault is that of who we are now In presenting us with  ways of seeing and living very different from our own however he changes  the question T he ancient Greeks and Romans are not who we are now  Moreover while our history has evolved from their legacy although nor in  a continuous thread what Foucault emphasizes in his later studies in con trast to the genealogical works is not their legacy to us but their difference  rom us It is not how the specific practices of the Greeks and Romans con verge with other practices in order to form who we are that matters here  Rather it is how d istant they are from our practices rhar is ar issue   This re location of focus has an impact on the question of who we are Ar  first glance we mighr say rhar ir shifts rhe concern from who we are now ro  who we once were Bur rhar is not enough As Foucault rells us he is nor  interested simply in knowing who we were H is research is never simply an  academic exercise The stakes here concern freedom rhey concern st raying   98     WHO WE ARE AND WHO WE MIGHT BE   afield of ourselves The object was to learn to what extem the effort to  think ones own history can free thought from what it silently thinks and  so enable it to think differently UP 9 So the shift is not the simple one  from who we are to who we were It is bener schematized in this way it is  from who we are now to who we might be Ye must be carefu l here  though Who we might be is not provided directly by the model of the anci ems Although there will be themes in the anciem approach to living that  Foucault endorses particu larly concerning the idea of the care of the self as  an aesthetics of existence the anciems do not provide us with a concrete  alternative Rather smdying them loosens the grip our presem has upon us  It allows us not only to conceive bur imaginatively to inhabit a differem way  of living It opens the door to our asking the questcon of who we might be   Alongside these three changes there are a number of cominuities with the  earlier works One of them is of particular momem Foucaults attemion  remains focused on practices on the strucmred forms of da ily living If he  writes abou t philosophers like Plato and Seneca it is with a d ifferent orien tat ion from the one the history of ph ilosophy has passed down to us He is  not interested in the anciems as theorists he is imerested in them as practi t ioners of what might be cal led true living To live r ightly to live according  to proper trmhs is the task of anciem philosophers rather than one of sim ply discovering the truth In this Foucault fol lows his comemporary the  ph ilosopher of amiqu iry Pierre Hadot to whom we will remrn Bm he also  remains faithful to his earl ier genealogical orientation of looking on the  ground at the practices that make up a life rather t han ascending to a more  purely theoretica l plane   If looking backwards from our perspective we see philosophy as a mat ter of discovering trmhs rather than orieming ourselves towards the proper  care of the self this is because we have lost the anciem approach to ph ilo sophy and with it the understanding of what anciem phi losophers were  doing In his lecture series of 1981 82 The Hermeneutics of the Subject  Foucault says   the more serious reason why this precept of the care of the self has  been forgotten the reason why the place occupied by this precept  in anciem culture for nigh on one thousand years has been obliter ated is what I will call  the Cartesian momem    It came  into play in two ways by philosophically requalifying the gnothi  seauton know yourself and by d iscrediting the epimeeia heautou  care of the self  HSLCF 14   Although the care of the self dropped our of phi losophical d iscourse  knowing oneself wh ich had been oriemed towads the care of the self   99     THE PHilOSOPHY O f FOUCAULT   became a matter of determining the conditions of a persons access to truth  Instead of mainraining itself as what Foucault sometimes ca lls a spiritual  project philosophical practice gradually transformed itself inro an episte mological one   What is the care of the self What is irs character and what makes ir a  philosophical matter Foucaults most sustained trearmenr of this concept  is in the recenrly published lectures from which the above quote is drawn  In those lectures Foucault traces the change in orienrarion of the care of  the self from Plato through Hellenic thought especially that o f the Stoics  and rhe Epicureans Vhat underlies Foucaults concern is the relation of  what he calls the subject and truth    This relation of subject and truth is a lens through which we can if we  li ke read the enrirery of Foucaults writings The archaeological work is a  matter of rhe subjects episremic placemenr in an arch ive By placing the  subject of knowledge in an archive Foucault rejects the phenomenolo gical t radition that he was brought up in and that his earl iest writings  susta in In phenomenology the subjects relation to truth is more immedi ate It is a matter of being able to see perspicuously almost in the sense of  Descartess clear and d istinct perception what needs to be grasped The  inrerference of history politics or language can all be overcome accord ing ro the phenomenological view However if knowledge is inescpably  located within the rules and norms of an archive if iris always historically  bounded then the possibi lity of a subjects immediate relation ro truth is  lost The relation of subject to truth runs through the arch ive   Genealogy mainrains the same rejection of phenomenology and adds a  political dimension to the historical one W hat one knows is nor a matter of  a pure seeing or grasping rather ir concerns a series of pol itical relation ships in which truth  or at least claims ro truth  is embedded   Of course Foucaults concern has never been w ith all areas of truth He  does not treat natural sciences such as physics and chemistry The truth rhar  concerns him has ro do with what he sometimes calls the human sciences  Psychology linguistics economics medicine psychoanalysis biology  these are the areas of truth rhar form Foucaults target We might say that ir  is nor a matter of subjects relation to rrurh bur rl1eir relation to their own  truth rhar lies at the core of Foucaults inreresr O r to put ir in the terms we  are using here the issue is subjects relation to who they are or ro who they  are now and as a part of this to who they rake themselves to be   This is what makes Foucaul ts discovery of the ancienr care of the self  fascinating ro him T he care of the self involves a differenr relation of the  subject to irs own truth  The care of the self whether Platonic Hellenistic  or early Christian requires one ro work on oneself in a way rhar trans forms who one is It is nor simply truth bur oneself rhar is at stake And in   100     WHO WE ARE AND WHO WE MIGHT BE   particular with Hellenistic thought the care of the self involves a lifelong  commirmenr ro selfcreat ion ro gerring free of who one is so rhar one can  become something else   Knowledge of the self at this level at least is nor then on the way to  becoming the deci phermenr of the mysteries of conscience and the  exegesis of the self which develops in later Christianity Useful  knowledge knowledge in which human life is at stake is a rela t ional mode of knowledge that asserts and prescribes at the same  rime and is capable of producing a change in the subjects mode of  being HSLCF 238   If we compare this idea with Foucaults own project of philosophy as  allowing one to stray afield of oneself the importance of the care of the  self becomes evidenr In both cases rhe relation of subject ro truth is nor  epistemological It is practical practica l nor in the sense of Kanrs moral  law nor in the everyday sense of helping navigate ones world smoothly  In many ways it is the opposite of the larrer sense of the practical The care  of the self requires one ro jettison ones normal relation ro the practical  world in favour of one that fai ls to conform to the expectations that are the  web of that world   The care of the self and Foucaults stray ing afield are practical because  they are both marrers of practice in rwo senses of rhar word First they are  marrers of how one relates to and engages in the social practices of which  one is a part They are nor merely projects of thought they are projects of  living Secondly to take care of oneself or to stray afield of oneself requires  practice lr requ ires a vigilant arrenrion to who one is being made to be  by the society around one and an often renewed commirmenr ro become  otherwise The ancienrs often engaged in what Pierre Hadar calls spiritual  exercises in which one repeats a variety of philosophical formulas to one self in order to keep reminding oneself of who one wanrs to be and of  the forces that are arrayed against ones achieving ir Marcus Aurelius for  instance often reminds himself in his Meditations that he will soon be dead  and forgotten so that he might stop lusting after fame Caring for onese lf  and straying afield of oneself are not simply produas of a single ep iphany  They requ ire constanr practice and renewed commitmenr   If the relation of subject to truth is in some ways common to both  Foucault and the ancients so is the goal of philosophical practice Ir is in  both cases a certain freedom a freedom that involves abandon ing some of  the norms that govern the society in which one finds oneself in favour of a  vision of a better way of living   101     THE PHILOSOPHY OF FOUCAULT   We should nor however interpret Foucaults project as identical to that  of the Stoics or of the ancients genera lly There are important differences  between Foucaults idea and that o f the ancient philosophers particularly  regarding the character of the freedom one seeks to exercise Among the  most important is that for the ancients there are proper ways to live and  the care of the self is required in order to achieve rhem Foucault writes in a  much later period one in which the idea of essentially proper ways to live is  foreign to many and certain ly to him So the care of the self is d ifferently  oriented It is not in the service of a right way of I iving a way of living that  would for the ancients be inscribed in the larger cosmic order Rather it is  in service of bringing reflective thought to bear on what one might make of  oneself One cares for oneself in the sense of having it matter what one can  make of oneself who one can create oneself to be   In an interview during this period of his work Foucault comments that   W hat st rikes me is the fact that in our sociery art has become some thing that is related only to objects and not to ind ividuals or  to life That art is something special ized which is done only by  experts who are artists Bur couldn t everyones life become a work  of art Why should the lamp or the house be an art object bur nor  life OGE 350   This view could not be expressed by a Stoic or a Platon ic philosopher It  orients the care of the self in a direction different from that of the ancients  bur at the same rime it reveals a ph ilosophical approach that concerns itself  not with conditions of truth bur with forms of living   In the lectures on the care of the self Foucault contrasts three paths for  caring for oneself that arise in the ancient world There is the Platonic path  exemplified in the d ialogue Alcibiades where Socrates advises the young  Alcibiades to know himself in the sense of discovering or recall ing who he  is There is the Hellenistic path in which caring for oneself is a confronta tion wi th and modification of who one is And finally there is the Christian  path which asks one ultimately not to modify bu t to renounce onese lf In  the second volume of the history of sexuality publlished two years later than  the lectures on the care of the self Foucault turns his attention to the anci ent Greek form that the care of the self rakes Here the framework is wider  than that of the Platonic path described in the lectures And yet it follows  the lectures in irs emphasis on three areas dietetics economics and erotics  a lthough it adds a fourth area on the re lation to truth  In the lectures  Foucault tells us with regard to letters of Marcus Aurelius The body the  fami ly circle and household love Dietetics economics and erorics These  are the three major domains in which the practice of the self is actualized in   102     WHO WE ARE AND WHO WE MIGHT BE   this period with as we see constant crossreferencing from one to the  other HS 161 Two years later this division is read back from the Stoics  into the Greeks as the framework for the proper construction of a life   Foucault offers a rich description of ancient wri tings concerning these  three areas Before ttrning to them he imroduces a term that does not  appear in the lecwres bm char frames the enquiry problematization Al though he does not define the term one can get a sense of it from the  passage in which he introduces it   It is often the case that the moral soliciwde is strong precisely  where there is neither obligation or prohibition In other words  the interdiction is one thing the moral problematization is an other It seemed to me therefore that the question that ought to  guide my inquiry was the following how why and in what forms  was sexuality constitmed as a moral domain Why this ethical con cern that was so persistent despite its varying forms and intensity  Why this problematization UP 10   Vhat is a problematization Foucault contrasts problematizations with  obligations prohibitions and interdictions The latter three terms will be  familiar to us from their role in currem moral thinking We tend to con sider the moral realm precisely as one of obligations and prohibitions  We might say that we think of the moral realm as divided into three areas  the prohibited the permitted and the required There are to be sure  gradations within them For instance there are acts that are permitted  bm discouraged or forbidden except under certain exceptional circum stances Bm the broad framework is one of d isallowances allowances and  requ tremems   However much of the normative intervention imo peoples lives  and behaviours does not fall under this simple rubric If moral theory is a  matter of sharp d ivisions the practice of living is more often a matter of  problematizations   Ve might say at a first go that problematizations occur regarding those  areas of life that are considered problematic For an area of life to be prob lematic is not for it to be a problem as in a problem to be overcome  Rather it is for that area of life to be fraugh t Instead of prohibitions  there are dangers Instead of obligations there are opportunities Instead of  allowances there are multiple ways these dangers and opporruni ties can  be navigated Like our traditional conception of the moral realm a prob lematic realm and in Foucaults view much of the moral realm is in fact  a problematic one is normatively laden But those norms have less to do  with the question of whether and more with the question of how And   103     THE PHILOSOPHY Of FOUCAULT   correlatively they are less concerned with ind ividual behaviours and more  with realms of life   Foucaults earlier works have prepared us for this idea As he tells us in  the second volume   There was the problemarizarion of madness and illness arising our  of social and medical practices and defining a certain parrern of  normalization a problematizarion of life language and labor in  discursive practices that conformed to certain epistemic rules  and a problemarizarion of crime and crimina l behavior emerging  from certain punitive practices conforming to a disciplinary  model UP 12   We must always be carefu l when Foucault reads his earlier works in light  of his later projects He often reinterprets what he has done in light of his  current project Here however the idea of problematizarion caprures an  aspect of the trajectory of his work Much of w ho we are is consriru red  nor by allowances and prohibitions bur by norms embedded in practices  that determine how we go about constructing w ho we are and what we  know Foucaults work whether archaeological genealogical or ethical  has a lways been a marrer of the historical investigation of norms that deter mine that construction   One might want to object here that the introduction of the idea of a  problemarization runs afoul of the concept of power Foucault develops in  his genealogical works In Discipline and Punish for instance Foucault sees  the operation of power undergoing a historical change Before the eight eenth century power operates on the binary model of the permirred and  the forbidden It is on ly in the last two hundred years that a more nuanced  type of power emerges one that can normalize or d iscipline subjects By  seeing problematization in an a historical fashion by seeing it as something  that concerns the ancients as well as the moderns is Foucault abandoning  this view of power Is he saying that power has always been positive and  creati ve as well as negative and restrictive Is he moving from a more his torical view to a more essentialist one   The situation may seem to be even worse for Foucault Nor only may  the inrroducrion of the concept of problematizar ion have removed power  from history it may even have inverted modern and premodern forms  of power Our current moral conception is dominated by obl igations  permissions and prohibitions Ancient morality as Foucault stresses is nor  So it might seem that in fact the type of power associated with normaliza tion and the d isciplines is more properly seen in ancient practices than in  modern ones It is the moderns who operate by means of a repressive power  whi le ancient practices create subjects through various problematizations   104     WHO WE ARE AND WHO WE MIGHT BE   In replying to this objection we must first d istinguish our concept ion of  morality from our practice of it Regarding power Foucault writes in the  first volume of the history of sexual ity that   One remains attached to a certain image of power law of power sovereignty which was traced out by the theoreticians of righ t and  the monarchic institution  It is this image that we must break free  of that is of the theoretical privilege of law a nd sovereignty if we  wish to analyze power within the concrete and historical frame work of its operation HS 90   The operation of power has changed but our conception o f it remains  bound to earl ier models of its operation The same is true for morality  Our practice of morality as Foucaults problematizations show is more  complex than our r igid division of it into three areas This is why Foucault  particularly in his works from 1975 on focuses on practices rather than on  theories or better why he focuses on theories on ly in their role of arising  out of and relating to practices   Yet another worry might encroach here Foucault argues that our con ception of ourselves on the one hand and who we are on the other cannot  be divorced But in his view of power and my extension of this view to  morality he seems to do precisely the opposite He says that our po litical  and moral views do not reflect who we have come to be Is there a prob lem here No For Foucault our conception of who we are comes more  from our practices than from political or ph ilosophical theory Who we  are is a matter o f our practices Vho intellectuals think we are is o ften a  matter of theories that although they are connecte d with certain practices  in their own right are often connected with practices that have less to do  with who we are than with an intellectual legacy that has more tenuous  relations to the practices that actually determine us This does not mean  that those theories are entirely divorced from who we are any more than  the rise of a positive creative form of power has entirely disp laced the  negative power theorized by those under the sway of powerassovereignty  Vhat it means is that those theories have yet to grasp what is happening  on the ground a grasp that Foucault turns to genea logy and then to eth ics  to achieve   W ith this in mind we can turn back to the initial worry that Foucaults  introduction of the concept of problematization th reatens to undo the his torical character of his conception of power In considering this objection  we should first ensure that we have distinguished problematization from  power They are not the same thing although indeed they are related  Where problematization occurs there is indeed the possibil ity of a power   105     THE PHILOSOPHY Of FOUCAULT   relat ionship of actions constra ining other actions W hat do we make of the  idea then embraced by Foucault during his genealogical period that the  operation of power is more negative and repressive in premodern Europe  and more positive and creative which bear in mind does not mean better  in modern Europe   I believe there is a shift here in Foucaults thought but it is less stark than  it may appear Problematization does open the door to a power that creates  subjectivity but there are limits to its abi lity to do so that are bound by the  technology and social state of the ti mes Recall that in order to monitor  populations in the way that biopower seeks to t here must be certain eco nomic conditions in place there must be concentrations of people and  there must be the abil ity to collect in formation across populations Or  again in order to discipline a larger group of people one must have the  technology to monitor that group Vhat makes negative repressive power  more prominent in premodern societies is perhaps among other things  the inability to engage in certain forms of control that many types of posi tive creative power require   This does not mean that there is no creative power in ancient practices a  point that Foucaults later studies do not deny To be sure Foucault does  not consider power in his d iscussion of the care of the self In an interview  from 1984 Foucault has this exchange   Q T hus there has been a sort of shift these games of truth no  longer involve a coercive practice but a practice of selfformation  of the su bject   MF Thats right It is what one could call an ascetic practice tak ing asceticism in a very general sense  in other words not in the  sense of a morality of renunciation but as an exercise of the self on  the self by which one attempts to develop and transform oneself  and to attain to a certain mode of being EC 282   Here the distinction Foucault allows the interv iewer to makes seems at  least to me too rigid It is not that the games of truth involving the care of  the self do not concern power Rather it is that power is not the focus of  Foucaults analysis There can be power in the way one is asked to care for  oneself Problematizations open up certain paths and d iscourage others  they involve actions upon actions that contribute to creating certain ways  of being However the power that inheres in these practices and that does  help create its subjects may not have the same coercive force as later forms  of creative power that require more technological advancement and d iffer ent economic conditions   106     WHO WE ARE AND WHO WE MIGHT BE   In the pre face to the second volume of the history of sexuality where  Foucault d iscusses the change in his approach from the one originally om lined in the first vo lume he seems to see problematization as more closely  entwined with power   To speak of sexual ity as a historically singu lar experience a lso pre supposed the availability of tools capable of analyzing the peculiar  characteristics and interrelations of the three axes that constitute  it 1 rhe formation of sciences saviors that refer to it 2 the sys tems o f power rhar regulate irs practice 3 the forms within which  individuals are able are obliged ro recogn ize themselves as sub jects of this sexual ity UP 4   T he first rwo axes are of course archaeology and genealogy The third  axis is what requ ires a chronological reorientation because in order to  accomplish ir Foucault believes he must analyze the practices by which  individuals were led to focus their an ention on themselves ro decipher  recogn ize and acknowledge themselves as subjects of desire ibid 5   Thinking of ethics and with it rhe issue of problemarizarions as an axis  that intersects with the axes of archaeology and genealogy brings it in closer  contact with power This in turn allows that power even creative power  can be an aspect of ancient forms of problematization This is where there  is I think a sh ift in Foucaults thought It is where power as a creative and  not merely repressive force can appear in ancient practices of living But the  sh ift is one of emphasis not an overturning of a historical view of power  Foucaul t does not say that rhe creati ve power he d escribes in the genealo gical works is nonexistent in the premodern period Rather ir emerges as  the dominant form of power the one most in need of analysis By introduc ing the concept of problematization by ascribing it a place in all his works  and by seeing ir as an axis that intersects with power he o pens the door to a  recogn ition that d ifferent types of creative power can occur in different  time periods Yet by the same token he can also say rhar the more urgent  forms of rhar power are the more recent ones for economic po litical and  technological reasons   Foucault does nor say any of this because he does nor address the prob lem However it is a perspective that allows us ro see both the continuity  and discontinuity of rhe later project with the earl ier ones   W ith this view of problematizations in hand we can ask how the  problematization that emerges among the ancients relative to sex occurs As  Foucault has emphasized sex in the ancient world is not yet what he would  call sexuality lr does not yet stand as the secret key to open the mysteries of  who one is it is not the centrepiece of ones identity Rather it is embedded   107     THE PHILOSOPHY Of FOUCAULT   in a larger ethical realm the realm of the care of the self What is this realm  like What makes something an ethical matter If we are to understand the  ancient care of the self we need to know in general what ethical space looks  li ke and then more specifically how that space is filled by ancient practices   Foucaul t isolates four elements of the ethical the eth ical substance the  mode of subjection the ethical work and the relos Together they form the  framework of eth ics or more generally of any moral practice On this view  moral theories of the type we have already discussed those that focus on  obligations and prohibitions would find their place within the larger realm  of eth ical problemarization   The ethical substance is this or that parr of himself that the ind ividual  must determine as the prime material of his moral conduct UP 26 Over  the course of history different ethical substances have been determined  For instance many modern ph ilosophers believe that behaviour is the  ethical substance For others like Kant the ethical substance is the will  It  need nor be either of these however It can be rhe soul or desire or the  emotions or passions   T he mode of subjection the French here is mode dassujettisement  which can be t ranslated as mode of subjection or mode of subjecrificarion  becoming subject to or becoming a subject  and Foucault probably has  both meanings in mind is  the way in which the ind ividual establishes his  relation to the rule and recognizes himself as obliged to pur it in practice  UP 27 For instance if I en list to fight in a war my country has declared I  can do so for many reasons I can en list because  believe it is my duty as a  citizen o f the country to protect it I can enl ist because I owe it to my fami ly  to protect them alternatively my enl istment can come from my sense that  the country we are fighting poses a threat to a larger world order that must  be maintained or that to refuse to fight might endanger the lives of inno cent people whom I have never mer but to whom I am morally obliged In  al l these possibilities lies the question of my relation to what is asked of me  and in that re lation I estab lish myself as a particular kind of ethical subject   The ethical work is the work that one performs on oneself nor only  in order to bring ones conduct into compl iance with a given rule bur to  attempt to transform oneself into the eth ical subject of ones behavior  ibid If in the mode of subjection one establishes how the ethical has a  hold on one in the ethical work one realizes that hold through what one  does Suppose I decide that my moral net ought to be cast more widely than  I have previously thought I am obliged nor only to people I care about bur  also to those I have nor mer but who are suffering in their own right How  might I establish myself as the kind of person who exhibits this obligation  I might read novels about people in other culmres who are undergoing  forms of deprivation that do nor affect people I know Alternatively I   108     WHO WE ARE AND WHO WE MIGHT BE   might travel ro some of these cultures Yet again I may decide that I do nor  need ro experience their suffering bur instead ro su brracr parr of my weekly  paypacker and give it to an organization that deals with poverty in foreign  countries All of these methods are modes of ethical work   The last element of the ethical framework is the relos An action is nor  on ly moral in itself in irs singularity it is also moral in irs circumstantial  integration and by virtue of the place it occupies in a pattern of conduct  ibid 278 The relos we might say is the point of moral conduct Is one  to conduct oneself morally in order to become a certain kind of individual  And if so what kind A person o f reason as Kant would have it A man of  selfmastery as will be the case for the ancient Greeks A person o f virtue  Or is the point of moral conduct instead to contribute to a certain kind  of world as the uti litarians wou ld have it In each case there is an ethical  vision involved a goal towards which the instances of conduct that estab lish or express certain relations ro a particular ethical substance are d ir ected That goal is rhe ethical relos   Together these elements form the framework of ethical action As Fou cault notes in all of these there are matters of conduct and practices of se lf formation Modern moral views rend to emphasize the conduct over the  selfformation wh ile the ancients rend in the other direction For instance  modern moral philosophers more often think of the ethical work in terms  of what one does to accomplish moral goals than in terms of who one  becomes by the conduct one engages in In that way there can arise the  emphasis on the permitted and the forbidden that seems to many ro be the  heart of modern ethics If Foucaults characterization of the eth ical is right  however that emphasis rakes place within a larger framework of practice  that has other elements that are formative of ethica l subjects bur that may  not be theorized as clearly Otherwise put ethical practice may outrun  ethical theory just as certain modern practices of power lie beyond the  theories of power meant to account for powers operation   Ethics In Ancient Greece   If this is the general shape of ethical space or alternatively of the historical  trajectory of ethical problemarizarion then we are prepared ro ask what  that shape looks like for the ancients In parricula Foucault is concerned  with that shape as it bears upon sex Sex is nor in itself a separate prob lematic area in ancient living an area wi th irs own particular ethical  problematizarion Rather it is parr of the larger arena of pleasures of  aphrodisia Foucault leaves the term aphrodisia un rranslared he uses it as   109     THE PHilOSOPHY Of FOUCAULT   a term of art Broadly it has to do with pleasures associated with certain  types of activity Not only sex but also food wine and relations with boys  are activities associated with aphrodisia  What all these activities have in  common is that they involve an intense pleasure one that could tempt a  person roward excessive indulgence Excessive indu lgence in mrn upsets  rhe narural order of living   For the Greeks aphrodisiac pleasures are nor morally suspect in them selves as they will be larer for Christian practitioners but rhey are inferior  The activities from which rhese pleasures arise are nor among rhe noble act ivities Aphrodisiac pleasures have a role in ones living but iris a secondary  role The intensity of rhese pleasures however threatens co make them  a primary focus of ones life Although rhey are secondary in rhe proper  order of living rhey may become a primary focus of arrention   It was jusr this acuteness of pleasure rogether with rhe anraction  it exerrs on desire char caused sexual activity ro go beyond rhe  limits char were ser by narure when she made the pleasure of rhe  aphrodisia an inferior subord inate and conditioned pleasure  Because of rhis intensity people were induced ro overrurn rhe  hierarchy placing these apperires and rheir sat isfaction uppermost  and giving them absolute power over rhe soun UP 49   How rhen is a person to approach rhe pleasures of aphrodisia of which  sex is an element rather rhan rhe whole In Chrisrcan thoughr the approach  will be centred on renunciation Aphrodisia will be associated with temp ration and therefore with sin the erh ical relation co rhe pleasures of  aphrodisia musr then become one of abandonment or barring rhar mar ginalization One can begin ro see here rhe birth of a conflicted anirude  roward sex one rhar remains wirh us roday if sex involves a rainred pleas ure bur is yet an unavoidable activity rhen indu lgence in ir is ar once neces sary and indecent Necessary because of procreation indecent because of  rhe inescapably impure pleasure ir enrails The Greek arcimde coward such  pleasures is more measured Renunciation is nor the proper relarion ro  rhem rather ir is knowing how and when to indulge   Foucault iso lates rhree elements in rhe knowhow of ones proper rela tion co aphrodisiac pleasures need t imeliness and srams There is no shame  in sex rhere is however a shame in overindulgence One needs ro engage  moderately One should be guided in ones sexual relations as in one s  cul inary acriviry and ones consumption of wine by need Vhere rhe need  is not urgem one should refrain Thar way concrol remains wirh rhe sub jeer of pleasures  the individual  and not wi th the pleasures themselves  Again rhere are righr and wrong rimes co engage in rhe acriviries char yield   110     WHO WE ARE AND WHO WE MIGHT BE   aphrodisia rimes of day rimes of the monrh rimes of the year Physicians  in particular are concerned wi th understanding the proper rhythms of  aphrodisiac indulgence Finally there is a concern with the status of those  who indulge that is perhaps most foreign to us now Particularly in mens  relations with boys issues of the class status of the partners the positions  taken during sexual activity active or passive and the age of the parrici panrs become matters of reflection in order ro determine their proper levels  and balance   If moderation is the proper relation ro aphrodisia then the person who is  capable of moderation is the person who can control his in the Greek case  the ethics involved only concern men desires One must become a master  of oneself One could behave ethical ly only by ad opting a combative atti tude toward the pleasures   These forces could nor be used in the moder ate way that was firring for them un less one was capable of opposing  resisting and subduing them UP 66 This idea of mastery and particu larly rhe image of barrie against pleasures may sound Christian Ir has a  differenr inflection though In Christianity one masters these pleasures  because they are ultimately robe renounced They are nor to be conrrolled  bur to be in so far as possible abandoned As wil l later become the Chris t ian and then Cartesian approach the pleasures of aphrodisia are pleas ures of the body Since the body is immersed in sin one must seek ro  overcome irs pleasures ro the exrenr rhar ir is in ones power to do so   None of this characterizes the Greek approach ro mastery The pleasures  of aphrodisia may be fraught they may be dangerous bur their dangers are  nor matters of sin They are nor irremediably indecenr Instead the dangers  of aphrodisia have ro do with upsetting the natural order of pleasures and  activities Selfmastery does nor require renunciation Aphrodisia remains  bur it remains under the cont rol of the subject of irs pleasures Foucault  refers to images used ro describe this mastery for instance Platos image  of the ream of horses wi th irs driver or Aristotles discussion of the ch ild  in relation ro the adult It is not necessary to kill the horses or the child bur  instead to ensure rhar they remain under ones direction and conrrol   Vhar does this selfmastery yield  lr yields a sort of freedom Freedom is  the goal of the ethical relation to aphrodisia This freedom is nor as we  moderns may think either a freedom from deterministic forces or from  political oppression It is a freedom in the self s relation to the self This  individual freedom should nor  be understood as the independence of a  free will  Irs polar opposite was nor a natural determinism nor was it the  wi ll of an allpowerful agency it was enslavement  the enslavemenr of  oneself by oneself UP 79 As Foucault poinrs our this freedom is virile  in character It is active rather than passive and involves power rather than  the mere absence of coercion   111     THE PHILOSOPHY Of FOUCAULT   In this sense the Greek approach to freedom and selfmastery brings  together two quali ties that often appear dissociated to us now viri lity and  moderation We often think of virility as a matter of imposing ones will  The virile man bends others to his desire Moderation on the other hand  requires one to refrain rather than to impose Combined in rhe same per son however viri lity and moderation become a mastery of self an impos ing of ones will by means of moderating ones desires T his in Foucaults  view is the Greek approach to ethics   In this approach we can see the four elements of ethics Foucault cites  The ethica l substance is aphrodisia It is that parr of the person that is the  subject of ethical reflection and practice The mode of subjection is the  knowinghow associated with need rime and srarus It forms what Foucault  calls a type of saviorfaire instead of being a set of permissions and prohibi tions it forms a sense of how to navigate among dangerous bur nor neces sari ly impure desires The ethical work is the barde itself the t raining and  effort required to bring the promised pleasures o f aphrodisia under ones  control The relos is freedom   Returning to themes from the 1982 lectures Foucault claims that the  selfmastery sought by the ancient Greeks is al igned with a particular form  of truth For Plato for instance in order to master oneself properly one has  to know oneself to recollect who one is Again we should not confuse the  philosophical relation to truth here with the relation that has come down to  us through what Foucault calls  the Cartesian moment It is nor a matter  of ep istemology of understanding the conditions of the subjects relation  to knowledge It is a practical relation a relation to truth as one of the  conditions for a person to achieve freedom The ancient relation to t ruth is  subsumed under the larger project of the care of the self It is nor that the  truth of things independent of oneself does nor matter Rather it is that  that truth matters in as much as it bears on ones relation to oneself One of  the current criticisms of contemporary phi losopby is that it concerns itself  with matters that are of interest only to the specialist it is d ivorced from  how we actually live Nor so ancient ph ilosophy in Foucaults view since  the project of ancient phi losophy is nothing other than the articulation of  proper ways to live   In this relation to truth Foucault discovers what he calls an aesthetics of  ex istence He contrasts this to the hermeneutics of desire o f later Christian  pracuce   Now whi le this relation to truth constitutive of the moderate sub jeer did nor lead to a hermeneutics of desire it did on the other  hand open onto an aesthetics of existence And what I mean by this  is a way of life whose moral value did nor depend either on ones   112     WHO WE ARE AND WHO WE MIGHT BE   being in conformity with a code of behavior or on an effort of  purification bur on certain formal princip les in the use of pleas ures in the way one disrribured them in the limits one observed  in the hierarchy one respected UP 89   Ve can recall the hermeneuric of the self from the first volume of the  history of sexuality There one learns to confess who one is in order to  learn ones narure Cenrral to this is of course the confession of ones  sexual desire In conrrast the truth of ancienr thought is bound not to a  hermeneutics not to an inTerpretation of who one is through a reading of  ones desire bur to the project of learn ing how to l ive   One might ask here whether the hermeneutics of desire that Foucault  discovers in Christianity is to be found in its earlier versions This would  seem to be a revision of his view from the first volume where he sees it aris ing in response to the Reformation He does not address this issue bur I do  not bel ieve a revision is necessary here The confessional is throughout irs  history skewed towards even if not exactly a hermeneUTics Even when it is  on ly a maner of saying what one does those doings are still ones own To  confess them is to pur oneself before another in the context of the larger  project of renunciation or purification Later when what is required is  the confession of desire the hermeneutic character of the confessional  becomes cenrral Bur the strucrure of the confessional is never far from a  hermeneutics   This confessional srrucrure is d isranr from the ancient project that relates  truth nor to what one tells bur to what one learns As Foucault puts it in the  1982 lectures   Now the subjects obl igation to tell the truth about himself   did  nor exist at all in Greek Hellenistic or Roman Anriquiry The per son who is led to tell the truth through the masters discourse does  not have to say the truth about himself He does nor even have to  say the truth And since he does not have to say the truth he does  not have to speak HSLCF 364   In the confess ional one tells the rrurh in ancienr practice one learns it  This learn ing rakes place in four areas dietetics economics erotics and   in relation to truth Dietetics is nor only about diet bur concerns the general  health regimen A proper health regimen requires moderation and timel i ness Foucault suggests rhar there are rwo types o f an enrion paid ro diet etics a serial vigi lance and a circumstanrial one The serial vigilance  concerns the order in which activities are performed activities were nor  simply good or bad in themselves their value was determined in part by   113     THE PHILOSOPHY Of FOUCAULT   those that preceded them and those that followed UP 1 06  C ircumstan tial vigi lance requ ires an awareness of the circumstances in which the activ ity is to rake place  the climate of course the seasons the hours of the day  the degree of humidity and dryness of hear or cold the winds the charac teristic features of a region the layout of a city ibid One must in engag ing in a proper health regimen follow a reasonable order of activities It is  imperative nor engage in excessive or deficient exercise sex or eating to  be aware of where and when the aphrodisiac pleasures are to rake place  and at all times to maintain control over oneself in any engagement   If sex has a d istinctive character in ancient dietetics it is because it more  than other activities is associated with vio lence expenditure and death  The sexual act is a violent one involving a surge of spasmodic activity that  threatens a persons selfmastery It also involves expenditure Sex involves  the imparting of lifegiving forces they are transferred from oneself to an other and thus entail an expenditure of ones own life forces Fina lly there  is in Greek thought an association of sex with death as there is in the  French language orgasm being le petitmort Just as sex brings life that  bringing of life is in recompense for lives that are passing away In regard to  the d ietetics of sex Foucault concludes that   The sexual act d id not occasion anxiety because it was associated  with evil bur because it disturbed and threatened the ind ividual s  relation with himself and his integrity as an eth ical subject in the  making if it was nor properly measured and distributed ir carried  the threat of a breaking forth of involuntary forces a lessen ing of  energy and death without honorable descendents UP 136 7   Economics in ancient thought concerns the running of the household  For the ancients of course the man is the proper ru ler of the household  This idea extends further among the Greeks to a lack of symmetry with  Plato an exception here regarding household obi igarions lr is not just rhar  there are different duties involved for the husband and wife The nature  of obligation is different The woman is obliged ro the husband bur the  husband is obliged to himself The project of the wife centres on fidelity  whereas for the husband it concerns selfmastery Thus it is that if adultery  is a wrong it is nor because a man has betrayed his wife rather it is because  a wife has betrayed her husband and because another man has betrayed his  civic duty toward that husband In sum then   The husband is selfobligated in this respect since the fact of being  married commits him to a particular interplay of duties and   114     WHO WE ARE AND WHO WE MIGHT BE   demands in which his reputation his relation to others his prestige  in the city and his willingness to lead a fine and good existence are  at stake ibid 182 3   Erorics is the most vexed of the aphrodisiac activities This has to do  in particular with the fact that it concerns love between men and  between men and adolescem boys For Christian ity the problemarization  of sex is centred on the woman bur for reasons just memioned the  problemarization of sex among the ancient Greeks does nor arise there It  arises in the sexual relations between males On the one hand these rela tions are characterized by equality since each of t he partners is an equal  citizen of the ciry On the other hand since the ethical requ iremem placed  on each is one of an active selfmastery the issue of passiviry becomes more  urgent The reason is that sex for the ancient Greeks is in dissociable from  penetration Penetration requires an active subject and a passive subject To  become penetrated is to become dominated to be mastered instead of mas ter This in itself is a d ishonour but the dishonour extends to questioning  ones ability to govern oneself and even more generally to taking ones  proper place in the governance of the ciry When one played the role of  subordinate parrner in the game of pleasure relations one could not be  truly dominam in the game of civic and political acriviry ibid 220   This question becomes even more complex when the issue is one of  sexual relations between men and adolescem boys On the one hand boys  like women are objects of beaury and can be appreciated and approached  as such On the other hand boys are to become men free citizens of the  citystate For a boy to allow himself to be dominated by another male is to  imperil both his imegriry and his reputation among fellow citizens This  seems to pur the boy in a paradoxical situation where neither acceptance  nor refusal can operate without leaving an unseem ly remainder   We can begin to see here why although the Greeks engage in rather  than prohibit sex between men their eth ical problematizarion of this  sex does nor provide a contemporary model for Foucault Nor only as he  indicates is there no possibi lity of a return to ear lier models of living In  addition there is an irresolvable comradiction that lies at the heart of  this problemarizarion namely the d ifficulty caused in this sociery that  accepted sexual relations between men by the juxtaposition of an ethos  of male superiority and a conception of all sexual imercourse in terms of  the schema of penetration and male domination ibid    Foucaults treatment of the relation of sex andl truth is more clipped  drawing from Plato and particularly from the Symposium He suggests that  the question of truth in regard to sexuality is one of true love It arises in the  relation between men and boys since women are nor considered equals and   115     THE PHILOSOPHY Of FOUCAULT   so are unable to rise to the occasion of true love For Plato however the  question of true love is transformed in Socrates lunds into the question of  the nature of love It becomes a re flection on Eros This leads Socrates to  endorse a love that is removed from physical relat ions between people and  turns toward a love of higher things This ntrn presages the later Christian  privileging of renunciation al though it does so not as much th rough what it  rejects as through what it seeks   The third volume of the history of sexuality extends the themes of the  second volume into the first two centuries of our era We will not follow  this extension in derail here In the 1982 lectures Foucault offers a more  detai led discussion of the care of the self in general The third volume on  sexual ity focuses on the care of the self as it bears on sex particularly in  regard to health marriage and the relation to boys Foucault summarizes  the changes from the Greek approach to these matters   A mistrust of the pleasures an emphasis on the consequences of  their abuse for the body and the soul a valorization of marriage  and marital obligations a disaffection with regard to the spiritual  meanings imputed to the love of boys a whole attitude of severity  was man ifested in the thinking of philosophers and physicians in  the course of the first two centuries CS 39   These changes may sound Christian and indeed early Christian ity draws  from them However they appear in a Hellenistic context that inflects their  meaning toward a form of selfcultivation rather than selfdenial   Foucault notes rhatthese changes stem in good part from a d ifferent view  of marriage and marital obl igations on the one hand and a different polit ical situation Imperial Rome as opposed to the Greek citystate on the  other The transformation of the view of marriage is one in which the wife  becomes a more relevant factor therefore beginning to shift the basis of  love from that between males to that between a male and a female Regard ing politics there are a number of modifications including the complex  bureaucratic institutions for governance that Rome develops T hese re place the more personal democratic institutions of the Greek citystare and  require changes nor only in the public sphere but also in the economic  sphere and the interpersonal one   Foucaults last two volumes on the history of sexuality are published  just before his death T hey have been welcomed by many scholars of  ancient though t if for no other reason than they confer on ancient studies  the cachet associated with Foucaults name Because Foucault is nor as  he openly admits a scholar of ancient thought one might ask after the   116     WHO WE ARE AND WHO WE MIGHT BE   accuracy of his inrerprerarions of Greek and Hellenistic texts and the con texts in which they are written Perhaps the most renchanr criticism of his  read ing emerges from the French scholar Pierre Hador whom Foucault  rakes as a model for his own orientation toward rh e ancienr texts   One of Haders most imporranr contributions to the study of ancienr  ph ilosophy lies in his idea that ancient ph ilosophy is cenrred on the question  of how one should live Ancienr ph ilosophy is nor as anachron istic inter pretations wou ld have it a project of inrerprering the world It is a matter  of figuring our how one should conduct ones life Therefore ph ilosophers  are not limi ted to those who have particular doctrines they defend A philo sopher in the ancienr world is anyone who conducts his life according to  a proper doctrine of how one should live To approach ancienr though t this  way opens it not only to a d ifferent inrerprerarion bur also to a differenr  ph ilosophica l sensibility One no longer asks whether the doctrine is cor rect in the sense of having explanatory power lnstead one asks whether it  provides a compelling picture of how a life should be conducted   The affinities Foucault finds with Haders approach are obvious Not  only is Foucaults general method of focusing on knowledge as it arises with  practices convergent with Hadots work his speclific treatment of ancienr  ph ilosophy ph ilosophy before the Cartesian momenr as a matter of the  care of the self is in line with Haders Indeed Foucault credits Hadors  work as an influence on his own reading of the ancienrs3 In turn Hadot has  written an article Reflections on the Idea of the  Cultivation of the Self  that offers his assessmenr of Foucaul ts approach4   Hador o f course is in sympathy with Foucaults emphasis on the care of  the self and on his approach to ancienr texts rhrough practices rather than  through abstract reflection However in Haders eyes Foucault misses a  crucial element of ancienr thought one that renders Foucaults interpreta tion anachron istic in its own way For the ancients the care of the self is not  directed solely toward ones selfdevelopment There is a larger cosmic  conrexr within which one cares for oneself and the goal of such care is to be  in accord with that larger conrext The universe has a structure and for  many ancienr thinkers a relos a goal To live properly is to live in accord ance wi th that structure or to contribute in the right way to that telos For  instance the Stoics think that the unfolding of the cosmos is a display of  reason the universe although always in flux accords with a rational prin ciple We might say that the universe expresses Reason with all the COI1110 tat ions the capital letter brings with it In being caught up in the everyday  concerns of ones life one neglects or is blind to that Reason and therefore  does nor live in the proper relation to it T he poinr of caring for oneself for  the ancienrs is to be able to atmne oneself to the larger conrext in which  one lives   117     THE PHILOSOPHY Of FOUCAULT   To pur the point another way it is nor freedom as Foucault would have  it bur objectively proper living that is the relos of ancient practices of the  self Hadar says   One seeks to be ones own master to possess oneself and find  ones happiness in freedom and inner inde pendence I concur on  all these points I do think however that thi s movement of inter iorization is inseparably linked to another movement whereby one  rises to a higher psychic level    wh ich consists in becoming aware  of oneself as a parr of nature and a portion of universal reason   Foucault as a product of twentiethcentury thinking fai ls to recogn ize the  larger cosmic framework assumed by the ancients In the wake of Nietzsche  and others who pronounce and work within the context of the death of  God Foucault forgers that for the ancients the existence of such a frame work is inseparable from their thought   If Hadar has the proper interpretation here and Foucault admits that he  is no scholar of ancient thought what difference would this make for our  relation to the last two volumes of the history of sexuality It wou ld intro duce a greater distance between our lives and those of the ancients To the  degree that we do nor see the universe governed by the type of Reason or  natural hierarchy or cosmic order characteristic of the ancients we are less  likely to make ancient living a model for our own Is this a problem for  Foucault In one way no and in another way yes Foucault is clear as we  have seen that he does nor rake the ancients as a model for contemporary  living He describes their lives in such a way as to loosen the grip ours have  on us His project is motivated as he puts it by the only kind of curiosity  in any case that is worth acting upon with a degree of obstinacy   that  which enables one to get free o f oneself  It is not because we should follow  the ancients that he seeks to understand their lives bur because they allow  him to see the contingency of our own selfunderstanding In this sense his  fa ilure to recognize the larger universal context they assume in their living  is nothing more than an interpretative mistake that needs correction   There is a sense however in which the error Hada r ascribes to Foucault  does cause his project a difficulty or at least introduces a cautionary note It  is clear that Foucault is attracted by the orientation of the care of the self  He finds it an attractive alternative to the current philosophical orientation  an orientation driven by concerns that are divorced from the question  of how a life might go When he complains that we think of objects bur  nor lives as works of art he is suggesting that the care of the self self cul rivarion may be a way of introducing aesthetic considerations into the  conduct of living Indeed he calls the ancient Greek attitude an aesthetics   118     WHO WE ARE AND WHO WE MIGHT BE   of ex istence And perhaps the reason he neglects to consider the wider  cosmic context in which the ancients think is that he seeks to bring the idea  of the care of the self closer to us If the ancients do not provide a model  for living at least we can borrow and rework for our purposes an important  element of their ph ilosophical approach   If Hadots reservations are right then we must be circumspect in that  borrowing and reworking We cannot simply remove the orientation and  apply it ro our lives because that orientation brings wirh it an assumption  or ser of assumptions that we can no longer embrace T his does nor mean  rhat we cannot use rhe orientation at all  bur it does mean rhat we musr  be carefu l We musr see rhe orientation provided by rhe care of the se lf  for what ir is in the ancient world and if we are tO adopt elements of rhe  ph ilosophica l orientation it provides we musr recognize rhe opportun ities and dangers of rhe transformation we shall be purring it through This  vigi lance is nor foreign ro Foucaults thought It is he after all who calls  our attention to derails that more general d iscussions often miss In rhis  case we musr apply his criterion ro his own work wirh all the caution rhis  impl ies   Ir remains for us in this chapter ro assess Foucaulirs work on ethics in rhe  light of the five characteristics I have suggested lie at the core of his rhough r  All five characterist ics are in evidence although at rimes in different ways  from the way rhey appear in some of the earlier works First iris clear as is  rhe case across the t rajectory of Foucaults work rhar rhe determination of  who the ancients are is a collective one Although the evidence for how that  determination works is more scant rhan in recent history  ar times  Foucaults interpretations are based on the few extant rexrs rhar address a  particular problem  he always assumes that these rexrs are reflective of a  broader social and historical context lr is not what individuals recommend  bur how a people approaches life rhar interests him Thar is why he focuses  on problematizarions His rask is to discover in regard to sex the norma rive issues the ancient Greeks and then the Romans face and what paths are  open ro navigate them   If Foucault retains a commitment ro collective d etermination however  rhere is a different in flection in his later work We lll ighr ar the risk of over simplifying say that rhis collective determination is more in flected toward  a collective selfdetermination In the archaeological works there is no dis cussion of how rhe determination of who we are happens This is because of  his focus on historical discontinuity In rhe genealogical works there is  more of a causal story bur rhar story involves power In rhe ethical writings  rhe introduction of concepts like care of rhe self and selfculrivarion seem ro  lend a sense of selfcontrol ro peoples construction of who they are that is  missing up unti l that po int In facr many critics of Foucaults early writings   119     THE PHILOSOPHY Of FOUCAULT   have been sympathetic to the later ones T hey rake Foucault as finally con ceding the importance of the role of subjectivity that is missing from both  archaeology and genealogy   My own view is that it is easy ro overstate the differences between  the earl ier and later works on this poim To be snre the idea of the care of  the self and the oriemarion toward selfmaking appear more prominemly  in the writings on ancienr thought However this is primari ly because  in Foucaulrs view the care of the self provides the framework for the  ancienrs view of their relation ro their lives If as the genealogical wrirings  suggest we ofren see ourselves rhrough rhe lens of psychology the ancients  ofren see rhemselves rh rough the lens of selfcare The ancients are no more   and jusr as importanr no less  able ro jerrison rheir co llective determina tion rhan we are   T his is nor to deny that Foucaulr believes rhar there can be fru itful bor rowing from rhe anciem framework for rhinking a bour our lives However  rhar borrowing will be in the service of living orherwise rhan we do now  And rhar project rhe project of living orherwise is never far from  Foucaulrs writings W hen he engages in genealogy for instance he does so  wirh rhe goal of showing us that since who we are now is rhe product of a  conringent history living otherwise is always avai lable ro us Perhaps rhen  rhe difference berween the erhics and rhe earlier works is rhat the erh ical  works in add ition ro providing alternative views o f how people have lived  offer positive elements robe appropriated It is not that Foucault has redis covered the subjecr The consrirurion of who we a re rhe construction of the  subjecr is always for him both co llective and comingent Rather it is rhar  rhe oriemarion of his wrirings is less overtly cri tica l than ir is of our more  recent history   These considerations also address the second characteristic of Foucaults  rhoughr rhar who we are is not jusr somerhing we can shake off T his is as  rrue of rhe anciems wirh rheir care of rhe self as ir is of us If as we have  seen power operates differenrly in the ancient world rhar is nor because  rhere is no power bur because the forms ir rakes correspond to the social  economic and technological orientation and capaciries of the rime Fou caulr does not argue rhar rhe ancienr Greeks or Romans are freer than we  are now Nor does he argue rhar they are less free When Foucault discusses  freedom his concern is nor the more and the less T he quesrion of free will  and determinism is nor a rouchsrone of his thoughr That we cannot easily  shake off the dererminarions of our hisrory is a central commirmenr of his  rhoughr Bur rhar rhose dererminarions are comingenr and rherefore can be  shaken off is just as cenrral a commirmenr W hether ulrimarely this shak ing off is a marrer of free will or anorher form of determinism is a question  rhar does nor interesr him   120     WHO WE ARE AND WHO WE MIGHT BE   The determinacion of ancienr Greek and Roman lives is as complex in rhe  ethical works as iris in rhe earlier studies W ho rhey are is nor rhe result o f a  single overarching or underlying rheme Ir is rhe product of a network of  inreracring practices and concerns T hose practices and concerns converge  on problemarizarions rhat are difficu lt to navigate and sometimes as in rhe  case of Greek male sex paradoxical or con tradicrory Moreover rhe last  rwo volumes of the history of sexuality are nor discussions of Greek life per  se but rather of a single rhread in rhar life the rhread of sex Foucaul t holds  rhar thread ro be of great momenr in the fabric of ancienr life Bur he  nowhere argues rhat ancienr life can be understood solely by reference to  sex or rhat rhe problemarizarions of sex are rhe only problemarizarions in  rhe ancienr world To rhe conrrary if we are to believe the lessons of rhe  first vo lume rhe arrempr ro make sex rhe pivor of understanding who one is  is precisely the project of normalization rhar Foucault seeks to overturn   In the archaeological works rhe question of complexity is a vexed one  To be sure rhe archives Foucault describes are complex The rules and  norms he discovers in them are elusive and difficu lt to isolate from rhe prac t ices and rexrs he studies On rhe other hand the question of generality  haunts his archaeological writings He seems uncertain abour the exrenr to  which rhe themes he unfolds are supposed ro be characteristic of a larger  social or cultural context By conrrasr rhe genealogical works are clearly  limited in scope Who we are is a product nor of a single ser of themes  bur of differenr intersections of d iverse practices that follow a complex  and con tingent historical trajectory Discipline is one theme biopower  another In rhe genealogical writings Foucault ho lds ro Bergers dictum  rhar we can no longer te ll a story as though ir were rhe only one   The last rwo volumes of the history of sexual iry although they treat a  single theme do nor betray rhe lesson of genealogy They remain faithful  to the idea rhar who we are is a product o f a comp lex history that can nor  be reduced ro a dominanr theme or movement or process T here is no  Archimedean point for understanding rhe ancients any more than there is  for understanding ourselves   The fourth characteristic of Foucaults rhoughr rhe intimacy of acting  and knowing is on full d isplay in rhe ethical works If one is nor careful  one mighr be tempted to say that rhe ethical works show a more inrimare  bond between action and knowledge than rhe earl ier works This would be  a mistake although there is a r ighr idea in ir Foucaults argument is nor  rhar rhe ancients have a deeper bond between their rrurhs and their lives  bur rather rhar they see themselves as having a deep bond The philosoph ical rrurhs with which the ancients are concerned contribute ro the care of  rhe self Those who practise such a care are drawn to rhe rrurhs rhar wi ll  assist them in rhar practice   121     THE PHilOSOPHY O f FOUCAULT   Compare this with the psychological truths characteristic of the discipl in ary regime On the one hand there is no formal project of selfcare charac teristic of the ancients either in psychology or in phi losophy On the other  hand and more important one sees who one is and how one should act in  terms of the psychological truths that form the epistemic framework of dis cipline One may not see oneself as constructing a life in the same way as the  ancient Greeks bur one is concerned with being normal and conforming  to the psychological concerns that preoccupy rhe carceral archipelago  The difference here is less than it might seem from a standpoint that sees  a stark division between genealogy and ethics It is less than it might seem  if we draw too sharp a line between constitution and selfconstitution  As Foucault reminds us with the concept of problematizarion beyond the  morality of duties and obligations there are always spheres of behaviour  that are the object of scrutiny ambivalence and uncertainty It is nor  that the ancients face problematizarions and we moderns do nor Rather  ir is rhar different problemarizations face each One of rhe important  problemarizarions for the ancients concerns sex in irs role in the care of the  self for the moderns it concerns ones psychological stare or ones sexual  desire in relation to normality   The last characteristic of Foucaults though t is t hat of the historical con tingency of who we are We have already seen the operation of this contin gency in the discussion of our collective determination In that discussion  the theme of freedom was broached It is perhaps fining ro end a considera tion of Foucaults treatment of the ancients with a d iscussion of the ro le of  freedom in his though t   There are many who see in Foucault parrico larly in his genealogical  works a po litical fatal ism Everything is a maner of power the product of  unseen forces insidiously determining who we are There is no reason to  struggle and no point in struggl ing anyway since we shall on ly wind up in  another nexus of power Among those who see Foucaults earlier works  this way there is often a sigh of relief that greers rhe appearance of the eth ical works After all here we are faced with a subject that can create itself  make something of itsel f rather than being merely a node in an evolving  system of power   However there is no great divide between the earl ier works and the later  ones T he concept of problemarizarion should make that clear Foucault  nowhere argues that our lives are completely circumscribed by the arch ives  he describes in the archaeological works or the powers he recounts in the  genealogical ones Conversely he nowhere clairns that the care of the self  is free from the constraints of the practices and norms of the rime Quire  the opposite To ask whether Foucault sees us as having free will or as  being completely determined by the contexts rules norms and powers he   122     WHO WE ARE AND WHO WE MIGHT BE   describes is to ask the wrong question It is to impose the free will debate on  a set of texts for which it is irrelevant This is nor to say that the debate itself  is nor important or that irs results do nor have an impact on how we see  Foucaults works Rather it is to say that Foucaults writings cannot be read  through the lens of that debate without distorting them   What then are we to make of the idea of freedom How does it apply to  Foucaults works if at all  There are two separate questions we might ask  here only one of which we shall answer One question concerns the nor mative status of the term freedom How does Foucault justify his criticism  of disciplinary power or his embrace of the care of the self or an aesthetics  of living as an exercise in freedom W hat reasons can he give us for valuing  the latter and nor the former Is it simply a matter of personal preference  and if nor why nor If certain forms of power must be abandoned and  others nor how do we mark the difference between the two These are  difficu lt questions ones that Foucaults writings do nor address except per haps ro invoke rhe term intolerable with regard ro particular practices or  power arrangements They are questions we cannot address here without  raking the discuss ion roo far afield bur are certainly worth the ask ing6   The other question is what does this freedom consist in If it is nor a  matter of carving our a space o f free will then what are we to make of the  freedom Foucaults works seek to offer us One hint for understanding it  relies on returning to Foucaults reference in the peface to the second vol  ume on sexuality to curiosity Curiosity in Foucaults sense means stray ing  afield of oneself Freedom for Foucault lies in this straying afield of who  one is Bur what is this straying   Our history yields a particular complex of practices with their ru les  norms problemarizations knowledges and power arrangements Each  of us participates in some of those practices By participating in them we  subject ourselves to some of those ru les norms problemarizarions know ledges and power arrangements That is how we become who we are Our  practices are laden with a pol itically ethically and episremically charged  history that infuses us through the practices we engage in What Foucault  describes with different inflections in all his works are important moments  and elements of that history It is a history that is at once constitutive and  contingent it makes us who we are bur nor by necessity If we understand  our history understand who we have come to be and understand that  we do nor have to be that then we are faced wirl the possibil ity of being  something else That is our freedom    We must be clear here To say that we can be something else is nor ro say  that we can be anything else We cannot simply choose who we are to be  The recogn ition of how we have come to be who we are does nor eliminate  the history that has brought us here It does nor eliminate the context in   123     THE PHilOSOPHY O f FOUCAULT   which we choose nor the constra ints that contex t imposes Moreover the  complexity of our historical legacy allows us to question some areas of our  lives but not all of them at the same rime We may question aspects of who  we have come to be bur we cannot step outside ourselves leap from our  own historical skin to choose our lives from some vanrage point beyond the  vagaries of our history and context To stray afield of oneself is not to recre ate oneself our of whole cloth Rather it is to experiment wi th who one  might be to t ry other ways of being that may turn our to be more tolerable  than who we are now In Foucaults wri tings and in his life the theme of  experimentation as an alternative to being who we are now is salient To  stray afield of ourselves is precisely to experiment with who we might be   What characterizes experimentation is its probing and tentative charac ter W hen we experiment with who we might be we do so in the knowledge  either that we might fai l or alternatively that we might succeed only to  find that our success has created another form of intolerability After all  the intersection of practices that has brought us to this point was not  intended to del iver us here Discipline and biopower are not the products  of design bur of a history that could very well have been otherwise In the  interview where Foucault den ies that he sees the Greeks as providing a  model for contemporary living he tells us   My point is not that everything is bad bur that everything is  dangerous wh ich is not exactly the same as bad If everything is  dangerous then we always have something to do So my position  leads not to apathy but to a hyper and pessimistic activism   OGE 343   If everyth ing is dangerous if everything is capabe of yielding the intoler able then we must be vigilant not only abou t who we have come to be but  also about who we seek to make ourselves to be We must look as we create  raking account not only of what we intend bur of what actually happens  YJe must bear in mind Foucaults dictum that people often know what they  do and why they do it bur not what their doing it does T his is what it  means to treat a life as an experiment   To be free is to be able to experiment with who we are It is to be able to  make ourselves into something other than what we have come to be to play  with overturn undercut rearrange parody go beyond the legacy that we  are And to do so is mostly if not always or completely a collective project  Freedom occurs as a we nor as an I It should be clear to us why this is If  our determination is collective if who we are is a product of a history we  share with others then any form of experimentat ion is likely to rake place  alongside others as wel l It is difficult although perhaps not impossible to   124     WHO WE ARE AND WHO WE MIGHT BE   imagine that a single person can succeed in strayng afield of themselves  when the rest of the social field in which they are immersed remains  unchanged Even to engage in so litary activities  writing or painting for  instance  is to respond to current social norms and expectations if perhaps  through rejecting them And it is to imagine others who are willing to  engage with ones own efforts either through reading or viewing or writing  or painting in turn   To experiment requires that there are others who are willing to experi  ment that there is a we wi lling to jettison the intolerable for something  that is perhaps better The freedom to become who we might be is like the  history that brought us here at once co llective and contingent As there is  neither necessity nor individuality to our historica l inheritance so there  is neither to our freedom  We face our possibi lities as a darkly lit path  together with those who are willing to travel it with us   125     CHAPTER FIVE   Coda Foucau lts own straying afield   Do not ask me who I am and do not ask me to remain the same  leave it to our bureaucrats and our police to see that our papers are  in order   How is one ro say something about Foucaults life in the wake of this  request Can one say anything at all without betraying him Or are we to  dwell within the irony that this thinker who told us so much about who we  are now and opened doors to our asking who we might be is someone about  whom we are barred from asking who he was   We cannot do biography T his much is clear We cannot say Foucault  is this he is nor that Or bener if we want to say who Foucault is we need  look no further than his writings T here he seeks ro tell us who we are who  we are now and he among us History nor psychology is what is required  to know who we are and to know the conti ngency of that who so we can  make ourselves into something else so that we can rake care of ourselves  mould ourselves into a work of art   We cannot place Foucault nearly in a set of psychological categories  and think we have remained within the ambit of h is own though t And yet  in the wake of this last chapter in the personal seeking his thought displays  there perhaps there is a way to say something about him that would reveal  a bit about his own selfcreation without placing him within an episremic  framework that his works constitute a constant srruggle to abandon   T his much alone for standard biography Foucault was born in 1926  and died in 1984 From here let us ask instead wh o he made himself ro be  We may ask this in many ways bur we shall let three suffice here Foucault  made himself a writer a political activist a sexual experimenter There is  more we could say and some biographers have attempted it 1 Our interest  here is nor in canvassing a life bur in seeing in Foucaults life an answer to  the question of who one might be how one might st ray afield of oneself  given who one has been made to be   126     CODA FOUCAULT S OWN STRAYING AFIELD   First a writer This is the most obvious aspect of who Foucault makes  himself to be and for that reason the one whose implications we are most  likely to miss When Foucault tells us late in his life that he writes to stray  afield of himself this is in keeping with the quotation from fifteen years  earlier that opens this chapters coda We know the aim of his wri ting to  tell us who we are now in irs contingency and this in order to open the  question of who we might be Bur what might this have to do with Foucault  himself the writer Is he lost to his writings Are they projects whose moti vation lies solely wi th their intended effect on his audience   Hardly This is nor how it is when one writes or at least when one writes  anyth ing worthwhi le To write about who we are who we have come to be  is nor only to recount a history it is to undergo it to feel irs movement as  well as irs contingency viscerally Vhen Foucault says he writes to become  something other than what he is this is nor on ly as a result of the writing It  is nor something that only comes afterwards when the work is completed  when iris whole when the words have been said To think otherwise is to  see a writer above his writing rather than within it Foucault makes clear  however that his writing is always an experiment a way of making himself  into something It is a way of making himself into something other than  he is   In his writing Foucaults present both emerges in irs fullness and loses irs  grip upon him That is where the power of the writing lies It is nor just a  fantasy It is nor just that Foucault frees himself in his head by writing He  does nor merely rake a journey if a true journey on a personal intellectual  itinerary If our present has us in irs grasp if it can make us believe that  who we are is who we must be this is nor solely by convincing us with  arguments It is nor solely cognitive it is affective as wel l Maybe even  more so To see the present in irs contingency then is not just to recognize  it by argument or by history It is to feel it And that is where the writing  assumes its significance   For Foucault wri ting is nor on ly a matter of telling us histories we should  know It is nor only tell ing himself such histories It is for him to undergo  those histories affectively It is to navigate the currents that have brought us  here and to see firsthand not on ly with his mind bur with the rest of his  body the openings that appear among those currents Vriting is a matter  not on ly of telling himself what he needs to know in order to take care of  himself It is itself a way of taking care of himself of making himself by  means of straying afield of himself   For some writers this is enough Foucaults co lleague Deleuze responds  to a cri tic who mocks him for writing about journeys he does not take  If I stick where I am if I dont travel around li ke anyone else I make my  inner journeys that I can only measure by my emotions and express very   127     THE PHILOSOPHY Of FOUCAULT   obliquely in what I write 2 This is nor Foucaults way To write is indeed  to make oneself into something else There are other ways as well and  Foucault chooses some of them   For instance politics There is a long history of the involvement of  French intellectuals in public political discourse This will strike many in  the United States in particular as strange Public debate in the Uni ted Stares  seems bereft of intellecruals On the one hand most of them have aban doned the field especially philosophers who have created a discourse that  often seems to immunize itse lf against public understanding On the other  hand those who place themselves  or are placed  at the centre of public  debate seem themselves immune ro intellecrual rigou r Nor so in France  where ar least since Sarrre the role of the public inrellecrual in modern his tory is taken for granted In Foucaults case ir is nor surprising that the  events of May 68 push Foucaul t as he arremprs ro grasp the operation of  power into the role of raking public stances and engaging in debate about   current 1ssues   Among those issues there are four that may be worrh noting First he  becomes involved in 1971 in the formation of the movement Groupe  dInormation SliT les Prisons GIP  This group works alongside prisoners  in order to call attention to prison conditions to unjust punishment and to  the political namre of the penal system Undoubtedly it in forms Foucaults  own thinking His nex t book published four years later is Discipline and  Punish However although Foucault is a leader in this movement he does  nor act as its spokesperson T his wou ld be a violation of his thought One  does nor tell prisoners what they should think one allows them ro speak  for themselves One works alongside prisoners nor in their name The pub lications of the GIP use information gleaned from firsthand conracr with  prisoners and also create space for prisoners themselves to write about their  own experiences and offer their own analysis of rhe prison system   In 1979 Foucault briefly becomes involved in the plight of the Vietnam ese boar people Recall that in the late 1970s many Vietnamese fled the  communist dictatorship of Vietnam by boar often raking dangerous jour neys in flimsy ships and often refused entry by countries such as the United  Stares and France wh ich contributed so much ro rhar country s destruc tion  In 198 1 Foucault participates in a press conference where he reads  a document that nor only signals his solidarity with the boar people bur  eloquently stares rhe bonds rhar might exist among all those who are sub jeer ro power He says   There exists an international citizenry that has its righ ts that has its  duties and that is commirred ro rise up against every abuse of  power no marrer who the author no marrer who the victims After   128     CODA FOUCAULT S OWN STRAYING AFIELD   all we are all ruled and as such we are in sol idariry   The wil l of  individuals must be inscribed in a reality that the governments  wanted to monopolize This monopoly must be wrested from them  bit by bit each and every day 3   Foucault is in sympathy with those who stand against aurhoriry In one  case this leads him astray During the Iran ian revollurion of 1979 Foucault  visits Iran several times as a journalist and becomes taken with the move ment against the Shah He speculates that an Islamic movement against the  government might offer new models for living and for selfgovern ing mod els that reject both liberal democracy and the roraUrarianism of many post colonial regimes This optimism is mistaken and Foucault soon distances  himself from it Among many whose view of Islamic movements is more  measured Foucaults sympathy for the Islamic resistance is thought to be  naive and he is excoriated in the French press for it For a while he with draws from public comment on current affairs   Nor permanently though Virh the rise of Solidarity in Poland Foucault  again lends his name and his time to a resistance movement against ru lers  In this he goes against the established left In 198 1 the Social ist Franois  Minerrand becomes Frances President ushering in hopes for a renewal of  the left in France The government however never fulfils these hopes  Early on it offers a signal of irs movement toward the centre by refusing to  stand with the Solidariry movement against the Po lish communist regime  Foucault refuses to support the governments stand and alongside other  prominent intellectuals openly supports Solidariry   There is a common theme among these four po litical involvements  They are all in support of movements against established authority In two  cases Vietnam and Poland Foucault opposes the rule of communists in  the case of Iran he opposes those who support the Shah in the name of  anticommunism With the GIP he works alongside prisoners against those  who rule them and more important who silence them There is a reason  for this one that is in keeping with Foucaults genealogical orientation   In an interview in 1977 Foucault distinguishes what he calls universal  and specific intellectuals Universal imellectuals speak in the name of  humaniry   For a long period the left intellectual spoke and was acknow ledged the right of speaking in the capacity of master of t ruth and  justice He was heard or purported to make himself heard as the  spokesman of the un iversal To be an intellecrual meam something  like being the consciousnessconscience of us a ll  TP 126   129     THE PHILOSOPHY Of FOUCAULT   The specific imellecrual by conrrasr does nor represem humanity He does  nor represem anybody Instead he works alongside those who struggle  providing imellecrual rools in specific areas that can be appropriated by  rhose who are capable of resisting rhe imolerable in their own name If rhe  universal imellecrual courts rhe danger of speaking in rhe name of others  rhe specific imellecrual courts the symmetrical danger of fa iling to see rhe  larger picrure wirhin which he operates The task Foucault argues is ro  remain a specific imellecmal without losing sighr of the general politics  of truth within which those struggles rake place   One can see Discipline and Punish and rhe first volume of rhe history of  sexual ity in this lighr They follow specific threads of our history of rhe  consrirurion of who we are now Ar rhe same rime they have larger and  more general implications They caprure imporram ways in which rhe pol itics of truth  powerknowledge  has infi ltrated our society Foucaults  pol itical involvemems reflect rhe same approach and attirude On the one  hand he works a longside and in solidarity wirh SIPecific struggles He does  so nor in rhe name of humanity bur in the name of rhose struggles them selves On rhe orher hand there is a larger issue ar srake one thar informs  all his involvements We are all ruled and as such we are all in solidarity  Against those who would rellus who we are and where we should stand  whether rhey be from rhe established right or rhe established left  Foucault  stakes our a position rhar resists the rrurhs rhar we are told are the only  truths on offer   In rhe interv iew where he speaks of universal and specific imellecruals  Foucault says   The essential political problem for rhe inrellecrual is nor ro criti cise rhe ideo logical contents supposedly linked to science or to  ensure rhar his own scientific practice is accompanied by a correct  ideology Foucault is referring here to Louis Althusser and con temporary Marxist imellecruals but rhar of ascertaining the pos sibility of const ituting a new politics of rrurh TP 133   We can see this possibi lity ar work in Foucaults public pol itical stances  lr is nor in rhe name of or against an establ ished ideology rhar he speaks  He aims instead towards rhe possibility of seeing who we are and where we  are differently from how we have been raughr This is whar makes him  so maddening politically for those who rake comfort in received political  caregones   Finally sexual experimenration Much has been made of the lasr years  of Foucaults life in rhis regard He speaks of his own homosexuality  and more notoriously in rhe eyes of some he engages in rhe practice   130     CODA FOUCAULT S OWN STRAYING AFIELD   of sadomasochism James Mi ller has written a breathless biography of  Foucault that derai ls his sexual experimentation and his encounters in the  bathhouses of 1980s San Francisco He ascribes it to Foucaults search for  limitexperiences and fascination with death4 Foucaults death of AIDS  seems to some to confirm this read ing of his sexual life I suspect the truth  is both more pedestrian and more in keeping with Foucaults intellectual  orientation Near the end of the first volume of his history of sexual ity  Foucault tells us that The rallying point for the counterattack against the  deployment of sexuality ought not to be sexdesire bur bodies and pleas ures HS 157 Why nor see his sexual experimentation in that light  Foucault himself offers this interpretation of his sadomasochist activities  The practice of S M is the creation of pleasure   and that s why SM is  really a subculture Its a process of invention S M is the use of a strategic  relationship as a course of pleasure physical pleasure   To create ourselves is in Foucaults view an experin1ent It involves  straying afield of onese lf in order to see where that may lead Foucaults  sexual experimentation should be seen as exactly that If it is titillating to  some this is nor because Foucault has chosen to titillate bur because his  experimentation has crossed the boundaries of rheir own experience   In writing politics and sex Foucault seeks He experiments His life  like his works is restless There are those who srray afield by immersing  themselves in a single activity seeing what it offers where it leads them bur  always further down a single road Foucaults selfcreation is different He  is in constant renewa l He does nor allow himself ro become comfortable  on a particular piece of terrain before he moves on Do not ask me to  remain the same There are many ways to experiment many ways to create  or to rake care of oneself many ways towards a new politics of truth In his  own life Foucault explores a number of them bur leaves behind enough  markers for us to go further along our own chosen paths   131     CHAPTER SIX   Are we still who Foucault   says we are   As I wri te this it is rwenryone years since Foucaults death His last pub lished book that does not deal with ancient practices is twentynine years  old Since his death we have seen the rise of the internet DVDs cell  phones gated communities Tivo sport uti lity vehicles email and instant  messaging The United States has started three wars two in Iraq and one in  Afghanistan Terrorism not communism is the chosen enemy of what  would charitably be called Vesrern democracies Neoliberalism has come  to replace welfare liberal ism in many quarters as the reigning economic  phi losophy of the stare Europe has made steps toward integration the  Soviet Union has disintegrated China seeks to position itself as the next  great national power as the Uni ted Stares squanders irs resources irs mi lit ary and irs good wil l In short much has changed   To admit that much has changed requires us to ask of Foucault a ques tion that is an ineluctably Foucauldian one Are we st ill who Foucault has  said that we are Do we remain the norma lized beings of discipl ine the  empiricorranscendental doubler the man of The Order of Things the  products of biopower the moral legacy of a Reason that seeks to keep its  madness at bay Are the accounts Foucault offers us still accounts of the  character of our being Or have we moved on Are we in another episteme  another archive another genealogical moment from the one Foucault has  brought us to   Foucault writes that his work is a contributon to a history of the  presenr DP 31 Is that present the same one we now inhabi t Or are we  in another presenr one that requires another thinker and another history  To be sure Foucault sees himself in N ietzsches term as an untimely  thinker Bur to be untime ly is to think aga inst the grain of ones rime to  offer a thought outside or beyond the rime in which one lives To be  untimely is nor the same as being anachron istic Are Foucaults works still  untimely or are they merely behind the rimes   132     ARE WE STILl WHO FOUCAUlT SAYS WE ARE   Are we now different   There are many who believe we have moved on that Foucaults works de scribe the emergence of the period before the one we are living in Foucault  never uses the term postmodem which for some srands as an indicator of a  new historical condition JeanFranois Lyorard would be among those  who embrace the term and the novelty it implies For others who either do  nor use the term such as Jean Baudril lard or who reject it as empty or  misleading like Gilles Deleuze there is still reason ro think that our history  has taken another turn that we need new concepts and new analyses if we  are ro understand who and where we are now as well as what we might  become   Some may respond by saying rhar twenty or thirty years is nor a long  rime Historical change is more often gradual than nor particu larly when  what is at stake is nor revolutionary upheaval bur more often the quotidian  practices rhar make us who we are Bur we need look no further than  Foucaults own works ro see that this is nor true In The Birth of the Clinic  a work we have nor discussed here Foucault traces the change in medical  views o f disease and rhus of the relation of life and death from a model of  disease as essence ro one of disease as lesion T his change rakes place from  the end of the eighteenth century ro the beginning of the nineteenth in a  period of little more than rwo dozen years BC chs 9  10   We cannot avoid a confrontation with the question of Foucaults relation  to the present There is no phi losophical fiat by w hich we can spare him  scru tin y any more than there is a ph ilosophical manoeuvre that would  allow him to be dismissed wi thout being read although there are some  who would wish the latter Even if we cannot and we will nor close the  debate on this question we must surely open it After all the stakes concern  who we are now Are we now still who Foucault says we are   Ve can refer ro the three thinkers cited a moment ago in order ro engage  this question Deleuze has written a small bur influential piece arguing rhar  we have gone beyond the historical juncture Foucault designates as the  discipl inary society Baudrillard argues that Foucaults concept of power  no longer applies to a world that is more virtua l than real Lyorard does  nor simare his famous work The Postmodern Condition in relation ro  Foucaults writings bur we can draw from it and related works the conclu sion that we have entered a new historical period one characterized by a  new type of capitalism Between the three works we can simare the three  most important characteristics that many have invoked at rimes with the  term postmodern ro argue rhar we have entered a new historical situation  fluid networks of control the rise of the electronic media the emergence of  transnational capitalism and rampant consumerism These characteristics   133     THE PHilOSOPHY O f FOUCAULT   are we shall see related Each thinker though p laces the accent on a dif ferent aspect of that relation   Deleuzes Postscript on Contro l Societies is only a few pages long It is  however one of the most often d iscussed of Deleuzes wri tings No doubt  this is in part because it is one of the most accessible Bur it is also one of  his most engaged attempts to offer an account o f the world we inhabit  It does nor as do many of his other works refer to the present either in  passing or indirectly It directly asks the question of where we are How are  we situated historically logically and programmatically Written in 1990  it is prescient in irs reference to the unfolding character of our rime   Deleuze begins the text by situating himself in re lation to Foucault  Foucault associated disciplinary societies with he eighteenth and nine teenth centuries they reach their apogee at the beginning of the twentieth  century  But Foucault also knew how shortlived this model was The  latter remark is not mere ly a gestu re of generosity Near the end of Dis cipline and Punish as Foucault is describing the tenacious abil ity of the  prison to survive its ongoing failures he notes the suffusion of processes of  normalization across society and remarks that  In the midst of all these  mechan isms of normalization wh ich are becoming ever more rigorous in  their appl ication the specificity of the prison and irs role as link are losing  something of their purpose DP 306 As a prediction of the future of the  prison in the United States at least this is premature However the thrust  of the remark is aimed not so much at the prison itself as at the idea that  normalization may nor in the future requ ire disciplinary enclosure   This is the idea that an imates Deleuzes  Postscript  Yiere in the midst  of a general breakdown of all sires of confinement  prisons hosp itals  factories schools the family2 The confined areas in which d iscipline is  instilled are no longer operative We are no longer subject to the particular  training that discipline invo lves because the closed and enclosing sires in  which that training has happened have lost their integrity This is not to say  and Deleuze does nor claim that these sires have become entirely irrel evant Rather it is that they are no longer central to the historical dynamic  that is unfo ld ing T he d isciplinary society is giving way to what Deleuze  calls control societies   The reason for this has to do with what Deleuze calls the logic of control  societies He cites several differences between the logic of discipline and  that of control First the temporal movement of discipline is circular and  in control it is endlessly forward In d iscipl inary societies you were always  starring all over again as you went from school to barracks from barracks  to factory while in control societies you never finish anything 3 Disciplin ary societies move individuals from enclosure to enclosure At each enclo sure one is moulded accord ing to the ways Foucault describes in Discipline   134     ARE WE STILl WHO FOUCAUlT SAYS WE ARE   and Punish In control societies by contrast chis serial mou lding does not  exist One is instead always moving to the next thing and the one after chat  whether it be as in Deleuzes example continuing education wi th continu ous assessment or the next fashion the next ph ilosophy of management  the next relationship Discrete spaces do not matter in ch is continuous move ment they can happen in any space or with electronic communication in  no particular space at all   Similarly disciplinary societies work within particular parameters and  contro l societies work with modulating fluxes   Money perhaps best expresses the difference between the two  kinds of societies since discipl ine was always related co molded  currencies containing gold as a numerical standard whereas con trol is based on floating exchange races modulations depend ing on  a code setting sample percentages for various currencies   Just as discipline occurs within a circular time associated with discrete  spaces and control works with an endless time tlat is not pegged to any  particular space discipline appl ies norms and values both to individuals  discipl ine and groups biopower and control floats among and between  individuals and groups subscimcing codes for norms   To understand the difference between codes and norms we might use  the analogy of quantum physics and Newtonian physics For Newtonian  physics the universe consists in discrete elements in particular lawful re lations The laws are li ke the norms of a disciplinary society Quantum  mechanics on the ocher hand works with probabilities rather chan laws  Ic is not chat there are no regularities and chat everyth ing is chaos Rather  there are probabilistic regularities chat are associated with the movement of  the whole rather chan of any particular element within chat whole Codes  are like chose probabilistic regularities   As an example one might chink here of the movement of fashion No  longer are the styles produced by designers the standard by which ochers  create clothing Now clothing and shoe companies send employees into  urban areas to discover what the dominant youths usually males in chose  areas are interested in In add ition there is a range of niche produces chat  seek to appeal co increasingly narrow market demograph ics The fashion  industry does not impose a sec of sartorial norms it modulates a code chat  arises from an array of sh ifting interests   Finally the logic of capitalism has changed Ic is no longer concerned  with production chat can be farmed out to less developed countries  Rather it focuses on what Deleuze calls metaproduction the oversigh t  coordination and marketing of production Markets are won by caking   135     THE PHilOSOPHY O f FOUCAULT   comrol rather than by establish ing discipline by fixing rates rather than by  reducing costs by transforming products rather than by specializing pro duction 5 Discip line is associated wi th factory product ion and factories in  rurn with the esrablishmem and maimenance of norms Comrol societies  do nor need a particular space because nothing is made and no norms are  imposed One might say that the lmerner or perhaps the laptop com purer is  ro comrol societies what factories are ro d isciplinary ones   Movemem without end or enclosure modulating codes and meta production these are the aspects of comro l societies the societies rhar  have replaced disciplinary ones Far from being chaotic these societies are  indeed regu lated not by imposing regimes of order in specific spaces bur by  imervening in the fluid and probabilistic unfold ing of the activities rhar  constitute them Deleuze does not argue that there is nothing left of dis cipline but he sees a new historical political and economic arrangemem  unfolding that is one step beyond the arrangement Foucault describes   One might ask of Deleuze whether comrol really is very different  from normalization or whether it is instead a modification Certainly as  Foucault admits there seems to be less urgency for enclosed spaces Ac cording to Foucault the reason for this is that normal izarion has so deeply  infi ltrated our society that one does not have to construct discrete spaces in  order to insti ll it Is this very different from what De leuze calls control   Although the idea of diffuse oversight is characteristic of both non enclosed normalization and comrol there are st ill important d ifferences  Deleuze is describing a dynamic d istinct from tha t of Foucaults discipline  Normalization involves the training of individuals according to particular  standards ir requ ires personal imervemion and oversight This is one  reason why earl ier societies could not have a project of normalization  normalization requires a certain leve l of social interaction and technolo gical communication processes associated with the rise of capital ism Vhar  Deleuze sees however no longer requires an ind ividual ized inculcation  of particular norms Rather it is a more amorp hous matter involving codes  and probabilities To be sure there are certa in nor ms in the broad sense of  the term There are sartorial fashions ways of acting and tal king things  people find valuable and so on However norms are products nor of  individualizing projects of normalization They are codes that arise across  societies that individuals pick up more or less as they go along Later we  shall return to the question of whether in fact COiltrol has rep laced normal ization as well as the d iscipline that produces it  For the momem it is  enough to recognize rhar they are d istinct processes   Recently Deleuzes friend Antonio Negri along with vlichael Hardt  has written a book Empire that extends Deleuzes discussion on control  societies6 They argue that the world is moving away from the structure of   136     ARE WE STILl WHO FOUCAUlT SAYS WE ARE   nationstates characteristic of the previous few centuries at least in much  of the world and towards a more fluid structure comprising nationstates  transnationa l corporations and nongovernmental organizations Although  the United States might be dominant among nationstates it cannot dom inate the world in the way say that Britain did during the heyday of imper ialism What Hardt and Negri call empire is distinct from imperialism  precisely in that the laner is structured by discrete nationstates pursuing  their interests through subjugation and exploitation whereas empire is  structured by fluid and intersecting political and economic networks with  no particular centre and only relatively demarcated geographic boundaries  Empire they argue has three imperatives the inclusion of all an affirma t ion of differences and a management and hierarchization of those differ ences In this sense what is often called posnnodemism and the rising force  of fundamentalism are coordinate ideologies one embraces the new sint arion uncritically the other rejects it by seeking ro move backwards Like  Deleuze Hardt and Negri do not claim that there are no winners and losers  in this new situation or that contro l does nor exist  Rather they claim that  winners are not to be seen as a particular class of people who can manipu late the system from above  everyone is included and that they are not to  be associated solely with a particular class or nation They are those who  monitor exert a measure of control over and benefit from the operation of   emp1re   Deleuze Hardt and Negri focus on the structure of the new historical  situation they believe we inhabit Baudrillard by contrast focuses on the  content and in particular on the technological content of our current his torical juncture Baudrillards early writings invert the tvlarxist concern  with production arguing that a radical analysis of society ought instead to  focus on consumption In his view our identities as producers have been  surpassed by our identities as consumers if we are to understand ourselves  it is the latter that should receive the analyt ical weight More recently his  work has been associated with hyperreality the replacement of concrete  lived realiry by a virtual electronic reality that is now the true aether of  our lives Hyperrealiry if not by name is already on d isplay in a work  Baudrillard publishes in 1977 a year after Foucaults first volume on the  history of sexuality Entitled  Forger Foucault it is an argument that the  operation of power Foucault describes is already outmoded Foucaults  genealogical works depict a world that no longer exists   Something tells us   that if it is possible at last to talk with such  definitive understanding abom power sexuality the body and dis cipl ine even down to their most delicate metamorphoses it is  because at some point all this is here and now over with7   137     THE PHilOSOPHY OF FOUCAULT   Forget Foucault levels a number of charges against Foucaults work  including the already refuted idea that Foucault reduces everyth ing to  power and therefore subverts his own position Baudrillards most interest ing thought however is that Foucaults stress on the role of power is part  of a productivist model of society of the kind that Baudrillard criticizes in  Marx We need to rep lace the concept of power with that of seduction if we  are to understand what is going on in our society   In what sense is the idea of power productive We have already seen it  One of Foucaults most striking challenges to the trad itional conception of  power is that in his view much of the power tow hich we are subject works  not by repression bur by creation Rather than preventing us from being  who we are or from realizing our true nature power operates by making us  who we are YJe are produced by power In this sense Foucaults work is in  Baudrillards eyes continuous wi th Marxs They operate on different ter rains bur they both embrace a view of reality that emphasizes the produc tion of that real ity   Baudrillard argues that this conception of power   is sti ll turned toward a reality principle and a very strong truth  principle it is still oriented toward a possible coherence of politics  and discourse power no longer pertains to the despotic order of  what is forbidden and of the law bur it still be longs ro the objective  order of the real   Here is where we can see the emergence of the idea of hyperreal iry At first  glance it might seem incongruous to accuse Foucault of too strong an  attachment to a reality principle and particularly to a very strong truth  principle Is it not Foucault after all who introduces the concept of  power knowledge a concept that seems to weaken rather than strengthen  our attachment to what we consider our truths For Baudrillard however  Foucault has not yet jettisoned the most important attachment the attach ment to a real ity to be analysed   Consider Foucaults dictum on the soul in Discipline and Punish   It wou ld be wrong to say that the soul is an i llusion or an ideo lo gical effect On the contrary it exists it has a reality it is produced  permanently around on within the body by the functioning of a  power that is exercised on those punished DP 29   This is the reality pr incip le Baudrillard refers to Power produces a real ity  that genealogy in turn can describe or account for It can tell truths about  it because there is something our there something produced for truths  genealogical truths  to be true of   138     ARE WE STILl WHO FOUCAUlT SAYS WE ARE   In Baudrillard s eyes a realiry produced or not that can be theoretically  accounted for is precisely what we no longer have Ve live in a world  governed not by a reality but by a virtuality that has no realiry In the terms  used by Baudrillard in Forget Foucault we are not produced we are  seduced   To begin to grasp this idea we can turn to a later text of Baudril lards Simulations T here he offers a chronological summary of three  orders of appearance that have governed our relation to reality since the  Renaissance    Counterfeit is the dominant scheme of the classical period from the  Renaissance to the industrial revolution    Production is the dominant scheme of the industrial era   Simulation is the reigning scheme of the current phase that is con  trolled by the code9   W hat is the d ifference between simulation and production If produc t ion works by creating realiry simulation works by feigning one There  is no real world in which our lives take place or better the real world is  no longer of any account The world in which our lives take place is a  simulated world one given to us by images that either no longer reflect the  real world or no longer need to We are plugged into images via our media  especially television and the internet that simulate a realiry T hat simulated  reality is now our own There is no longer a real ity principle because the  concrete reality described by those like Foucault s till in thrall to thinking  in terms of production has been rep laced by a s imulated reality that is  neither produced nor preexisting There is nothing or need be nothing  beyond the image In an arresting encapsulation of his view Baudrillard  tells us that   Disneyland is presented as imaginary in order to make us bel ieve  that the rest is real when in fact all of Los Angeles and the America  surrounding it are no longer real but of the order of the hyper real  and of simulat ion 10   Seduction is a matter of simulation and the hyperreal rather than of pro duction and the rea l To seduce is to die as reality and reconstitute oneself  as illusion 11 Seduction works not by creation bur by lure   Seduction is that wh ich is everywhere and always opposed to  production seduction withdraws something from the visible  order and so runs counter to production whose project is to set   139     THE PHILOSOPHY OF FOUCAULT   everythi ng up in a clear view whether it be an object a number  or a concept 12   Consider the activity of seduction in the everyday sense of the term To  seduce someone is not to dominate them to subject them to ones wi ll  Seduction does not make an appearance on the scene as something visible  It works more by what is suggested but not there rather than by what is  there To seduce someone is not to impose somerhing it is to set things up  so that they do the imposing they make the move they fill the void left by  the seduction itself   In Baudrillards view if there is such a thing as power in our current situ ation of hyperreality it operates not by production but by seduction   against Foucaults functional vis ion in terms of relays and trans missions we must say that power is something that is exchanged  Not in an economical sense bur in the sense that power is executed  accord ing to a reversible cycle of seduction challenge and  ruse   power seduces by that reversibility which haunts it and  upon which a minimal symbolic cycle is set up 13   The reversibil iry of seduction is Baudrillards answer to the question of  how to resist power Seduction is a game It is a game that can be played by  either side In fact the complexiry of this game is such that it can become  unclear who is seducing and who is being seduced   The law of seduction takes the form of an uninterrupted ritual  exchange where seducer and seduced constantly raise the stakes  in a game that never ends And cannot end since the dividing line  that defines the victory of the one and the defeat of the other is  illegible 14   Baudrillard substitutes the game of seduction for the couple power  resistance in Foucault Rather than a power that impresses itself against the  resistance it meets in reality there are the reversible lures of seduction that  work without reference to a realiry that wou ld coalesce them   In a world of simulation it is seduction rather than power that is the  motor of po litical and social movement and exchange Seduction has no  reference to realiry and nothing within it ever becomes solid or stable  Seduction  never belongs to the order of nature but that of artifice  never  to the order of energy but that of signs and rituals Foucaults genealogy  of power remains stuck in the previous historical epoch the epoch that  ended wi th the rise of simulation and hyperrealnty We are governed not   140     ARE WE STILl WHO FOUCAUlT SAYS WE ARE   by relations of power but by the seduction of images in a game without end  that we too participate in    JeanFranois Lyotard s The Postmodern Condition is perhaps the most  famous of all discussions of postmodernism The Postmodern Condition is  commissioned in the late 1970s by the Quebecois government as a report  on the current state of knowledge The themes of rhe book however have  been taken to have much broader app lication than just the ep istemic one In  the book Lyotard defines postmodernism as incredulity toward meta narratives 16 This definition which he admits at the outset oversimplifies  matters points towards an attirude that characterizes posnnodern move ments in literarure art academics and politics We might put rhe core idea  this way Humaniry has for much of irs history seen itse lf in rhe context of a  larger narrative in which each of our lives is an element This larger narra t ive brings together the smaller narratives that const itute our knowledge  of ourselves and our world In that way it is a metanarrative a narrative  under whose umbrella other epistemic and moral narratives find their place   For much of human history  at least recorded human history  our  meta narratives have been rel igious in nature During recent centuries how ever other meranarratives have come to compete with and often to replace  religion Lyorard points to two metanarratives that have situated our know ledge over the past several centuries One is the Enl ightenment narrative  that sees the rise of science as a liberation from the supersti tions of the  past The other is the Hegelian metanarrat ive of the spirit coming to self understanding In both cases there is a story about the operation of our  knowledge that places it in a broader narrative context   One of the ro les and perhaps the major role of this context is to justify  our knowledge This just ification is a broad one It is not a justification in  the sense that a science experiment justifies a hypothesis Meranarratives  justify knowledge by offering it a sense of meaningfulness or significance It  is the role that knowledge plays whether it be in the service of coming closer  to God or of the liberation of humaniry from superstition or of the process  of the spirits coming to know itself that justifies knowledge as a whole   The incredulity toward metanarratives that characterizes the postmod ern condition is a wariness towards this larger justifying picture In the  postmodern condition which is our condition there is a loss o f belief or  faith that knowledge can be justified as meaningfu l or sign ificant This leads  to a crisis of knowledge since rhe point of epistemic projects now becomes  uncertain   In The Postmodem Condition Lyotard provides an alternative view  of knowledge that he believes will fill the hole left by the decline of  metanarrative I would like to focus on another aspect of his thought My  concern here is not what Lyorard says might serve as a better just ifier for   141     THE PHILOSOPHY Of FOUCAULT   knowledge bur what he says acrua lly does serve as the justifier T he latter  has to do with capitalism and the criterion of justification is what Lyorard  calls performativity Performariviry has to do nor with moral justification  nor with spiritual uplift nor with liberat ion it has to do with resu lts In the  absence of a credible meranarrarive what justifies knowledge are the resu lts  it can give in terms of efficient app lication to or manipulation of our world   What however justifies performariviry Thar is a question that once  wou ld have been answered by appeal to a meranarrative Performariviry  wou ld be justified by some story in which we saw ourselves playing a role a  story that wou ld tell us who we are and at the same time what role perfor marive knowledge plays in making us who we are Bur there is no narrative  li ke that any longer at least none that grips most of us Performativiry must  be irs own criterion irs own justifier which is to say that ir is unjustified   Even if we can live with performativiry being unjustified however there  is still another question that remains unanswered lhich types of perfor mariviry ought ro be fostered This again is a question ro which a meta narrative might offer an answer Lcking that however how have we come  to approach it After all efficient functioning depends on what one is  trying to be efficient about What are the criteria or the goals that allow  us to decide how to direct the performativiry o f our knowledge In The  Postmodem Condition Lyotard does nor offer us an answer ro this  question bur he begins ro suggest one near the end of his later book The  Differend He constructs his answer in terms of the relation of capital ism to  rime bur I would like ro simplify it a bit in order to focus on a key phrase  Capita lism does not consrirute a universal history iris trying ro consrirure  a wo rld marker while deferring ir since it also needs the gaps between  national communities 17   A universal history is meranarrative Capital ism does not supply a meta narrative It supplies a world marker What govern a world marker are not  values of the kind one might find in a meranarrarive values that confer  meaning or sign ificance W hat governs a world marker is exchange In the  void left by the loss of meta narratives capitalism has stepped in and offered  exchange as the gu id ing standard for performativiry How does it work  Those who have studied elementary economics will be famil iar with the  operation T hose forms of efficiency to be fostered are those that people are  will ing to exchange for Performariviry is to be d irected toward what the  market ho lds as valuable and what the market holds as valuable are those  things for which people are will ing to exchange something in order to  receive or own Stripped to irs essentials performariviry is to be directed  towards what people will buy   One might want to argue here that the distinction drawn between a uni versal history and a wo rld marker is misleading In particular the idea that   142     ARE WE STILl WHO FOUCAUlT SAYS WE ARE   rhe former embodies values and the other does nor is wrong Does rhe  srrucrure of exchange nor embody irs own values perhaps nor rhe values of  traditional meranarrarives bm values nonetheless If meranarrarives pro more values of service ro God or liberation from superstition does rhe rise  of performariviry and particularly o f exchange nor promote rhe va lues of  individual choice Can we nor say rhar where once common national or  human values reigned values rhar brought us rogerher in a common strug gle or destiny now we are beholden ro individualist values rhar are more in  keeping with rhe dispersed mulriculrural world in w hich we live The issue  is nor one of choice between values and no values bm between rhe rypes of  values embraced And if this is t rue is ir nor also true rhar conremporary  capitalism does have irs own meranarrarive one involving the rise of indi vidual choice and freedom from culrural or social or national or ideo logical  hegemony   The objection is a forceful one However I do nor believe rhar ir is in rhe  end compel ling lr is nor rhar there is no privileging of individual choice in  our world There certainly is And it is nor that rhar privileging is nor held as  a value The problem is rhar from the perspective of the individual and  particularly rhe ind ividual consumer ir is held as a personal value nor a  common one With rhe dominance of exchange each of us believes in our  own individual choice Each of us believes rhar we should receive what we  desire We do nor hold this as a value for others a value rhar brings us  rogerher a value rhar would form rhe basis of a metanarrarive Rather we  might say we hold ir as a personal right rather than a un iversal value   Moreover from rhe perspective especially of rhe corporations rhar en gage in performariviry and rhar drive rhe world marker values are nor an  issue Profit is If rhe current world is more in thrall ro a world marker than  ro national enriries or traditional meranarrarives then one of rhe results of  this has been the decline of the concept of common values generally and the  r ise of a profit motive rhar does nor answer the question of what rhar profit  is for Its srory ends wirh pro fir nor with any values rhar underl ie ir just as  individual choice rests on personal desire rather than on the general value  of such choice for humanity   In Lyorards introduction of rhe world marker as rhe arbiter of per formari viry we can see rhe intersection between his rhoughr and rhar of  Hardt and Negri Whereas Hardt and Negri are concerned with rhe srruc rure of forces in rhe emerging transnational world order Lyorard focuses  on rhe marker and rhe way performariviry and exchange work in thar  marker Both works however see what we might cal l a horizontal integ ration of markers and transnational entities d isplacing while as rhe quote  from Lyorard notes nor entirely replacing rhe old vertical order of  national entities rhar confront or interact wirh one another as exterior ro   143     THE PHILOSOPHY Of FOUCAULT   one another The rise of transnational entities particularly of transnational  corporations has been documented exhaustively in recent years   Masao Miyoshi for instance derails in a 1993 article the transition from  colonialism to transnational ism particularly with regard to the decline of  nationstares and the rise of transnational corporations 18 He argues that  transnational corporations are beginning to replace multinational ones  as their allegiance to particular nationstares d iminishes and their global  mobility increases Miyoshi notes that among rhe effects of the rise of  transnational corporations are a loss of concern for the we lfare of indi genous populations a homogenization of wealthier classes across national  borders a greater disp lacement of workers who fo llow the migration of  jobs environmental degradation arising from a lack of concern about local  conditions and a cooptation of academic institutions to which trans national corporations provide funding and from which they receive  expertise If we think of the structure of control that Deleuze depicts the  transnational structure delineated by Hardt and Negri and the rise of  performativiry based on exchange that Lyorard d iscusses these effects of  rransnationalism wil l nor seem foreign to us   From another angle we can also see the intersection between Lyorard s  thought and Baudrillards early inversion of Marx ism Recall that before  Baudrillards turn toward hyperrealiry he argues that Marxs focus on  production should be turned around It is consumerism nor production  that forms the core of contemporary capitalism Alongside the rise of  rransnationalism the emergence of consumerism is another effect of the  substitution of performativiry and exchange for the values embedded in  meranarrarives This might seem un likely After all one might ask is nor  performativiry a matter of production rather than consumption Does it  nor have to do with efficiency in what is made regardless of the ultimate  point of making it On the other hand what gu ides performativity is  exchange It is consumption that determines wlhar is to be produced If  Lyorard is right here then people think of who r hey are more centrally in  terms of what they consume than in terms of what they make It is the  houses they live in the cars they drive the clothes they wear the restau rants they ear in that determine who they are to themselves rather than  the jobs they do Performarivity yes but performariviry in the service of  consumption   Lyorards thought then like that of both Deleuze and Baudrillard  argues that we have entered a new historical period There is a break what  Foucault might call a historical discontinuity between earlier historical  epochs and the one we are inhabiting now We are no longer who we were  thirty or even twenty years ago Whether the stress on who we are now  should be placed on the structure of the world we live in irs increasingly   144     ARE WE STILl WHO FOUCAUlT SAYS WE ARE   virtual and mediated character or the loss of meranarrarives in favour of  performari viry and exchange we must recognize that histories that deposit  us in the mid1970s can no longer account for who we are A new chapter  or a set of new chapters must be written The genealogies must be ex tended Ye are no longer who Foucault says we are   There is much to consider here In order to address these ideas ad equately l would like to proceed in three stages First it would be worth  addressing each proposal individually from a Foucauldian perspective  Each l think has shortcomings in as much as it proposes that we have  moved beyond Foucaults though t We must bear in mind however that  Lyorard does nor address Foucaults thought directly so we are read ing  that idea into his perspective Secondly the three proposals share a  commonal ity in their approach that make them in an important way dis riner from Foucaults own approach I wou ld like to show that from  Foucaults perspective this commonaliry is a weakness in as much as these  approaches are attempts to account for who we are now Finally however  I believe that it is undeniable that the changes these thinkers discuss are  important ones I would like to recognize that by appeal to the lectures  that Foucault gives at the College de France in 1979 These lectures which  have just been published and as of this wri ting remain untranslared can  be read as a contribution to the historical changes Deleuze Baudri llard  and Lyorard discuss T his contribution offers a d ifferent stress from that of  each of the other three However it is po inting in a direction that would  nor be entirely foreign to the intersection of their t hough t   Deleuze argues that we now live in a sociery o f control Our lives are  characterized by a lack of particular enclosures a new temporal rhythm  codes instead of normalization and meraproducrion We have already seen  that Foucault is ready to concede the decline of particular enclosures as a  sire of discipline Should he be ready to concede rhar discipline itself has  been surpassed T he question hinges on the relevance of normalization  Deleuze argues that we live in the modu lating flux of codes rather than the  individualizing discipline of normalization Has rhe former replaced the  latter or is normalization still an important force roday   l do nor see a decl ine in the power of normalizaruon In fact the situation  may well be the opposite Normalization rather than giving way to codes  seems both to exist a longside them and at rimes to be a necessary support  for them If we think of normalization arising from discipline in particular  spaces we can perhaps see a bit of a decline Bur it is easy even to overstate  this T hink for instance of the operation of schools one of the central  sires of discipl ine Diagnoses of Attention Deficit Hyperacriviry Disorder  ADHD in its various psychological subtypes have at least in the United  States not declined They have increased19 They are as rampant as the   145     THE PHilOSOPHY Of FOUCAULT   medications rhar are supposed ro comrol them School personnel as every  parem knows

primary wage  earner a woman and children the Malthusian couple Particularly ana  rhema are single mothers hysterical women and gay couples perverted  adults Nor ro menrion the perennial problem of

gay communities with their own  inregriry and practices they become what rhe operat ion of sexual ity makes  them people defined by the character of their desire   In the disciplinary operation of

support rhe rise of certain codes Remrn ro rhe example of  fashion we used earlier to understand how codes operate A shoe designer  goes ro rhe inner city with differem shoe models and asks the dominam  males in various urban groups to evaluate them This may seem like a move mem away from normalization It is certainly a nnovemem away from dis cipline in irs classic form However in order for this method of shoe design  ro work it requires a differem type of normalization It requires a comer gence between shoe design marketing techniques and dominan t urban   146     ARE WE STILl WHO FOUCAUlT SAYS WE ARE   males This convergence creates a set of norms that although nor d iscipl in ary are certa inly as forcefu l in their way as the normalizarion that arises  from discipline   One might wanr to object here that this last example is nor one of nor malization bur simply of conformity Is normalization as Foucault depicts  it nor a more precise practice or set of practices involving the inrervention  inro behaviour through hierarchical observation norma lizing judgement  and examination Yie might see these operations at play in currenr rheo logical practices in regard ro sexuality bur is it not a stretch to see them in  support of the rypes of codes Deleuze d iscusses I do nor believe that it is  Through the development of technology people see themselves mirrored  or nor mirrored through the images they are presenred with Those images  in league with people around them present a normalizing force that in  a d ifferent way from traditional discipl ine retains al l three elements  Hierarchical observation becomes comparison of oneself with the images  one sees and with ones peers and superiors Normalizing judgemenr and  examination come from those same sources And even if the processes of  judgement and examination are more informal nevertheless they apply ro  as minure elemenrs of behaviour as those intervened upon in the train ing of Prussian soldiers Normal ization has nor been replaced by codes  bur exists with them at rimes in collaboration and at rimes independenr of  the movement of codes The rise of codes has certainly changed the char acter of some normalizing procedures in particular with regard to the en closed spaces associated with traditional discipl ine bur it has nor replaced  normalization   Turn ing ro Baudrillard we must ask whether indeed we live in hyper reality Baudrillard has a penchant one that the reader will no doubt have  noticed and that many readers of Baudrillard have commented on for  staring his posirion in irs mosr exrreme form  As a rherorical ploy rhis is  effective and it al lows him to create striking formulations such as the one  on the ro le of Disneyland Foucaults approach however is more meas ured So we must ask whether the hyperreal iry Baudrillard posits indeed  caprures the world we live in  This is nor a question of whether our experi ences have become increasingly mediated by electronic technology lr  would be foolish ro deny that they are or that they have taken a leap in this  direction since the publication of Foucaults first volume on the history of  sexuality Rather the quest ion is do we live in hyperreal iry   The answer here it seems to me is no The reason for this is that contra  Baudrillard the referent of images sti ll has an importanr role ro play in  our interaction with the world Yihat images are or purport to be images  of still matters And as long as this remains the case our experience cannot  accurately be described as one of hyperreal ity   147     THE PHilOSOPHY OF FOUCAULT   Although it is true that the power of the media to shape peoples percep tions is far greater than it once was it is also true that people hope the  med ia offers an accurate portrayal of the world they live in Critiques of  the media are often formulated in terms of misleading or false portrayals  of world evems For instance one of the cemral justificat ions for Presid em Bush s initiation of war against Iraq concerns the claim that Iraq had  weapons of mass destruction a claim we now know to be false It is the  comparison of what the Presidem claimed and the media dmifully repon ed  with what mrned om acntally ro be the case char is the heart of the matter  here This seems to undercm Baudrillard s view that we inhabit a world of  hyperrealiry   However perhaps we should rake a subtler look What Baudrillard  might argue here is char the example as I have presemed ir ignores an im porram aspect of what happened It is nor he migh t say the nonexistence  of weapons of mass destruction char maners Rather the cemral point  is that chis nonexistence was brought before rhe media and is still kept  al ive in the media Reporters refer to ir talk show pundits analyse ir  anchorpeop le use it as a touchstone of their repon ing on the administra tions policy in Iraq Should the Bush administrat ion have been successful  in covering up the nonexistence of the purponed weapons the fact of  their nonexistence would nor maner lr would nor figure in the config uration of our experience It would be as though there had indeed been  weapons of mass destruction in Iraq and the United Scares had found  them Their absence would be irrelevam In this way it is the images that  determine our world nor the reality to which these images refer   Pm this way Baudrillards poim is powerful bm at the expense of  becoming a historical If people are led to believe something false by what ever means and cannot have access to the rrmh then that rrmh will remain  foreign to their experience They will be unable to reflect or act upon  what is really the case T his poim does nor apply simply ro comemporary  society bm to all societies It is a broad philosophical poim rather than a  historical marker of our rime Moreover the poim itself does nor support  the idea char the reality referred to by images is no longer of momem  Instead it makes the more modest claim that often people do nor have  access to that real ity   None of this is meam to deny that in a world where electronic media  play such an important ro le images are often taken for real ity nor that  one of the most prevalem ways that reality is distorted or hidden is through  the media Rather the idea is char although Baudrillards claim that  Foucaults view of power remains trapped within a reality principle may be  true that wou ld be a poim in Foucaults favour rather than Baudrillards  We may live in a world where images play a far more imporram role in   148     ARE WE STILl WHO FOUCAUlT SAYS WE ARE   determining our experience than they once did We do nor however live  in a hyperreal ity   The stakes for Foucault in this d iscussion are enormous For instance if  we did live in hyperreal ity among the things that would become irrelevant  are our bodies Ir is what we see rather than any intervention of the world  on our bodies that determines who we are That is why seduction wou ld be  a preferred strategy of resistance it does nor refer ro bodies bur instead to a  suggestiveness that has no corporeal form In Foucaults view power often  operates at the level of the body Both discipl ine and sexual ity centrally  involve a relation of various practices to our bodies Perhaps what is  necessary here is nor as Baudril lard would have it a claim that practices  of power oriented towards our bodies have passed away bur instead an  analysis of the role images play in determining the orientation and char acter of our bodies What have our bodies become in the wake of the rise  of electronic media and irs images And what does that say abour who we  have become T hese it seems are the relevant questions There are many  ways to address them and among those ways a Foucaulrian genealogy  might not be entirely beside the point   Turning to Lyorard we must ask after his concept of posrmodernity and  particularly after the role that capita lism plays in replacing meta narratives  with exchange Ir is probably worth noting in passing that this replacement  although distinct from Deleuzes claim that normal izarion is being replaced  by codes has affinities with it In particular there is a relation between the  idea of unfenered exchange and that of codes20 Before turning to capita l ism however it is worth lingering a moment over an important similarity  between Lyotard s view and Foucaults   Lyotard believes that the posrmodern world exhibits a wariness toward  meta narratives No single overarching story about who or where we are or  are headed compels peoples assent Foucault in turn jettisons overarching  views of who we are particularly in his genealogies He sees who we are as  a result of the intersection of a number of threads of practice threads  whose weave forms nor a single panern bur many Moreover for Foucault  the operation of power in the modern age has become increas ingly dis persed It is no longer primarily the repressive execise of several centuries  ago It is increasingly a creative force that emerges through various and  often unrelated practices In this sense both Lyorard and Foucault are  looking at our world with a similar eye Although Lyorard grounds his  view in the twentieth century and Foucault rakes a longer view there are  resonances between their approaches   In this resonance however there is a discordance that distinguishes  their views Lyorard values the loss of the grand narrative if nor the capit alism that has commandeered that loss For him incredul ity toward   149     THE PHilOSOPHY O f FOUCAULT   meranarrarives opens our onto nove l ways of living It allows for a recog nition of competing narratives and for respect for different genres of  discourse different ways of conducting speech and engaging in language   from the episremic to the moral to the aesthetic In The Differend for  instance one of his criticisms of contemporary capitalism is that it blunts  the power of genres reducing them all to the sing le d iscourse of exchange  Although the loss of the grand narrative has created a space in which dif ferent smal ler narratives could flourish capitalism has filled that space by  translating all narratives into matters of exchange and rhus closed the  possibility that postmodernism opens   Foucaul t by contrast does nor turn to the d ispersion of practices in  order to find something ro value We might pur the point by saying that his  orientation in contrast ro Lyorards is analytic rather than normative It is  nor because there is something of value in the loss of an overarching theme  or narrative that Foucault focuses his attention on minor everyday prac tices lr is because rhar is where we are being created If we want to under stand who we are now and in particular how we have been made to be who  we are now then we need to look on the ground rather than from some  overarching perspective The various and d ispersed practices that consti tute the current aerher of our lives are not necessari ly better than anything  offered by a grand narrative As we have seen in many cases they are intol erable For Foucault then in contrast ro Lyorard there is no privileging of  smaller practices in contrast ro larger ones informing his embrace of the  derails of our history There is instead the projecr of asking about the char acter of our present   T his discordance leads ro his divergence from Lyorard Lyorard worries  that contemporary capitalist ways of thinking and acting have subsumed  and reduced others to their own parameters Foucault wou ld be uncom fortable with this view He need nor deny the imiPorrance of the discourse  of exchange or of the related phenomena of globalization and transnational  capitalism any more than he need deny the place of codes or images in con stituting who we are now In fact as we shall see Foucault has a contribu tion to make to the d iscussion of contemporary views of capital ism Rather  it wou ld be Lyorards insistence on the primacy of exchange that runs afoul  of Foucaults analytic scruples If what I said above in response to Deleuze  about the persistence of projects of normalization is r ight then there are  indeed forms of discourse that are both outside rlhe genre of exchange and  pol itically o ppressive or intolerable   Neither al l discourse nor all pol itically charged d iscourse is in the process  of being reduced to the capitalist discourse of exchange that Lyorard  describes Although much d iscourse intersects with capitalism each has irs  own parameters its OIIVIl integrity and requires its OIIVIl treatment if it is   150     ARE WE STILl WHO FOUCAUlT SAYS WE ARE   co be understood This is the sal ience of Foucaults appeal to smaller dis courses as an analytic rather than normative end eavour The picture of  capitalism on the one side and smaller better genres on the other must give  way to a picture of various intersecting genres with capital ism dominating  in some playing a minor role in others and being nearly absent in others  sti ll   The problem with Lyorards approach and it is a problem common to all  three announcements of a new era is that it seeks co account for who we  have become in terms of a single register Deleuze Baudrillard and Lyotard  look for the one thing that has made us who we are now as distinct from  who we were twenty or thirty years ago Codes as distinct from discipl ine  hyperreality and seduction as distinct from reality and power rhe capitalist  genre of exchange each of these is posited co account for who we have  become In rhe first rwo cases where rhe contrast with Foucault is stared  rhe authors posit a false symmetry between their thought and Foucaults  They operate by way of saying  No it isnt rhar rs this Bur that is nor  how Foucault operates Discipline is on ly one among rhe forces that have  made us who we are And Foucault does nor contra Baudrillards reading  see everything as a matter of power Multipl icity s inherent in Foucaults  approach and has been since the beginning In rhar sense a historical  cri ticism of Foucaults approach would more likelly be of moment than a  broad philosophically oriented criticism rhar seeks to subsume particulars  under an overarching structure At least a historical criticism if it were not  in the service of a broad phi losophical agenda need not posit rhe approach  of a particular one of his works as a microcosm of his larger view   The problem common to these three approaches is rhar they rake a  birdseye view They glide far above the realities that make us who we are  This is what allows them to reduce the complexity of our historically  formed present to a single explanation or a single factor It is nor rhar they  see nothing of who we are To the contrary they offer acute insights into  our current condition The problem is rhar they try ro rake in roo much at a  glance If we are co follow the lesson of Foucault s methodology we need  co return to the ground and investigate rhe space in which we live Genea logy is grey and patiently documentary it is nor bright and reducrively  explanatory   In this sense the projects of Deleuze Baudrillard and Lyorard are al igned  with those of Descartes Freud and Marx They are looking for the key  explanatory factor rather than investigating rhe world in irs proper dis persion This is not co say that their thought is in all ways continuous with  those of Foucaults predecessors Far from it For instance each of the  three recent thinkers focuses on rhe character of our present rather than  on a timeless essence However they share with those earl ier thinkers a   151     THE PHilOSOPHY O f FOUCAULT   commitment to a single explainer and in that commitment they have not  yet reached Foucault must less gone beyond him    One might want to face Foucault straight on here however and argue  that his problem is precisely that his thought is one of dispersion One  might say that our wo rld has indeed changed radically so radically that  there now is a single explanation for who we are a single account that can  be given of our present It might be the account that Deleuze offers or that  of Baudrillard or Lyotard Or it may be some combination of the three  It may be that we live in a world of t ransnational capitalism that is guided  by codes mediated through a hyperreality and in the process of reducing  all discourse to that of capita list exchange Perhaps each of these thinkers  has caugh t an aspect of the larger web in which we are now caught In any  case and this wou ld be the crucial point it is a s ingle web and no longer  the myriad of intersecting but d istinct practices Foucault describes  Globalization and technologica l development have deposited us on new  shores shores that are characterized by a single coastline and a common  inland T hat is where we live now   I have suggested by way of criticizing each of the thinkers that there are  reasons to believe otherwise For instance normalization seems to be a  more dispersed set of projects than a single explanation wou ld have us  bel ieve However in the face of this possibi lity these remain merely sug gestions In order to resolve this disagreement we would have to go much  further further indeed than can be gone in this book   What wou ld be required in order to answer the question of whether who  we are now is subject to a single account There would need to be a stttdy of  the kinds of texts Foucault relies on on ly focused on the past thirty years or  so in order to see what they yield For instance if we were to ask about the  relation of sexual ity to global ization and the electronic media we would  have to investigate sex manuals sexual advice and pornography on the  Internet practices of sexual counselling sex education in schools church  discourse on sex cl inical and theoretical approaches to sexual deviances  the role of the confessional and the appeal to sex by po liticians among  other sources in order to understand the changes that have occurred since  the first volume of Foucaults history of sexuality We would have to ask of  these texts and practices what kinds of norms andor codes andor values  they promote how they relate to previous texts and practices with what  other tex ts and practices they intersect what their role is in contemporary  capitalism how the electronic media affect our interaction with them and  what the consequences of all this have been In short we would have to do  a genealogy or rather a number of genealogies   If there is a single account of who we are now if our world has gone  beyond the one Foucault describes then we shall have to discover this by   152     ARE WE STILl WHO FOUCAUlT SAYS WE ARE   means of a Foucauldian methodology To proclaim the existence of a new  era wirhour engaging in the parienr labour of arch ivai work is nor to have  gone beyond

rhe driving   153     THE PHilOSOPHY O f FOUCAUlT   questions o f governmental iry Foucault defines govern mentality as involv ing three things first an ensemble formed by the institutions procedures  analyses and reflections concerning a complex form of power which has  as irs target population as irs principal form of knowledge political  economy and as irs essential technical means apparatuses of security   secondly a tendency toward the preeminence of this type of power  and thirdly the process of the transformation toward this preeminence  Gov 102 3 It requ ires the substitution o f the idea of power for that of  institutions of strategies for that of govern men tal functions and of the  creation of a field of objects for the assumption of preexistent objects  STP 12021   We can see here that the project of studying governmental iry is continu ous with Foucaults genealogical method Focusing on practices rather than  abstract theory oriented toward issues of power and positing the ere arion of objects through power rather than accepting their preexistence  Foucaults lectures on governmental iry are of a piece with his preceding  work   Over the course of the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries a practice  of governmental iry arises that is concerned with the power of the state on  the one hand and the rights of the individual citizen on the other T he stare  particularl y irs administ ration th rough what Foucault calls the police seeks  to draw the most our of the resources of irs citizens as well as concern itself  with their proper wellbeing Here we must undesrand the concept of pol ice in a broader sense than the everyday one Pol icing is nor simply a matter  of providing internal security through an armed force It involves all those  measures that are directed toward state and citizen wellbeing from census raking to hea lth policy to security to education The police ensure a viral  state through and alongside their knowledge of and intervention into the  population a concept that arises at the same rime as that of the stare Vle  might think of the sexual measures developed as a result of population  studies as policing in this sense   Over and against the propriety of state policing stands the concept of  individua l rights T he realm of rights constitutes the area in which the  stare and irs police cannot intervene T he space o f rights is one might say  a free zone immune from the powers that might otherwise overwhelm  the individual Much discussion of governmental iry during this period is  centred on the shape of that free zone irs extent and irs limits wh ich  are correspondingly the extent and limits of governmental intervention   Early into the emergence of this type of governmental iry however there  exists alongside it an economic view that will eventually come to compere  with it This view migh t be summed up in Adam Smiths image of the invis ible hand For these thinkers it is impossible for the government to have   154     AR E WE STILl WHO FOUCAU lT SAYS WE ARE   the proper knowledge of the population particularly with regard to the  mechanisms of the economy requ ired to imervene in the r ight way co  optimize state flourishing Rather chan pol ice imervemion what is required  is a ce rtain scare modesty a willingness to allow certain things rather than  promoting them in order co achieve its proper goals Recall here Adam  Smiths idea char if everyone is allowed to act freely in their own imeresc  at least in the realm of production and t rade everyone will wind up bener  off   It should be stressed and we shall return to chis poim chat this compet ing view which is indeed char of liberal ism does not substitute individual  freedom for state imervemion lc does nor enlarge the realm of individual  action and shrink chat of the scare Rather it shifts the types of imerven cions the state can make from chose of traditional policing co chose of ensur ing that the proper mechanisms of the market are in place and allowed to  operate   W hat are the characteristics of chis early liberalism Foucault cites three  veridiction of the market limitation by the calculus of governmemal mil iry and   the position of Europe as a region of economic developmem  un limited by relationship co a world market NB 62 The idea here is  char in comrasr co earlier economic views liberalism posies first that the  market is no longer a space of justice bm one of tru th It is no longer a mat ter of ensuring chat exchange relations are just recall the early Christian  critique of moneylending as usury but of understanding how they work  in order co maximize their beneficence Secondly that understanding re quires a limitation on govern me mal imervemion imo the market Thirdly  knowledge of the operation of the market shows that economics is not a  zerosum game W inners do not arise at the expense of necessary losers  This is the lesson of Smiths invisible hand everyone can win th rough  proper market cooperation   Liberal ism Foucault poims our reverses the trad itional relationship  between the state and the market Now rather than milizing the market in  order to profit the scare the scare is seen as needing co support the mechan isms of the market This does not mean that the state necessarily assumes  a secondary importance although this may happen  rather that the con t inued health of the state requ ires that it no longer engage in the earl ier  project of policing   It is in poseSecond World War Germany that I iberalism in irs comem porary and highly influemial form begins Ordo liberalism which had  begun to be developed in the prewar period by thinkers such as Wi lhelm  Ropke comes to dominate d iscussions of rebui lding the German scare  Ordoliberalism answers to a question char arises for Germany in the after math of the war It is a quest ion char is the opposite of the one most stares   155     THE PHILOSOPHY Of FOUCAULT   face T he problem for rhe already exisrenr stares is rhar o f asking how ro  limit stare power in order ro create a space o f free exchange The Germans  had rhe exact inverse problem ro resolve Given rhar a stare does nor exist  how ro make ir exist starring from rhis nonstare space which is one of eco nomic liberty NB 88 The ordoliberals answer rhar one must create a  stare rhar supports rhe marker rather rhan the reverse   This answer has resonances for those engaged in rhe reconstruction of  postwar Germany because by submitting rhe srare ro rhe marker ir forms ar  rhe same rime a critique of stare power Ordoliberals argue rhar stares by  their narure seek power and rhar o ffering stares t he power ro inrervene in  rhe lives of people will lead rhem down a road rhar ends in totalitarianism  Thus rhe idea of a more limited stare appeals ro those who have been rhe  object o f German fascism Bur their critique is more poimed Purring  power particularly economic power in rhe hands of any stare is a step  down rhe road roward roralirarianism There is a conrinu iry between rhe  New Deal and Nazism rhar lies in rhe concenrrarion of power in rhe stare  Vhar is requ ired is a stare under rhe surveillance of the marker rather rhan  a marker under rhe survei llance of rhe stare ibid 120   T his idea is picked up in rhe United Stares by rhe theorists who form  rhe early vanguard of neoliberal ism Foucault emphasizes rhar neoliberal  doctrine is nor a doctrine of noninrervenrion by rhe stare lr requires non inrervenrion inro rhe direct workings of the marker However there are a  number of inrervenrions rhar can be made into rhe framework rhar supports  rhe marker T he ordoliberals pose rhe question ir being given rhar the  processes o f economicopol itical regulation are nor and can nor be those of  rhe marker how can one modify material culrura l technical and juridica l  bases rhar are given in Europe ibid 146 T he neoliberals answer rhis  question by positing individuals as homo oeconomiws and designing social  pol icy from rhar assumption   Who is homo oeconomicus He is rhe person orienred toward marker  production and exchange He seeks ro maximize his welfare by means of  making rhe best use of his resources and his environment He is in short a  capitalist in all aspects of his life He sees rhe projects of his life in terms of  enrerprises rhar requires certain inpurs and have l he possibi lity of yielding  particular benefits Foucault offers examples of this way of thinking by  American neoliberals in ch ildraising work and other areas Ir would per haps be worth drawing our his analysis of Gary Beckers neoliberal rrear menr of criminal ity since ir provides a conrrasr ro disciplinary mode ls  Foucault discusses in Discipline and Punish   For Becker a criminal is someone who is calculating rhe benefits and  costs of committing crimes In facr he defines a crime as any action rhar  makes an individual run rhe risk of being condemned ro a penalty peine   156     ARE WE STILl WHO FOUCAUlT SAYS WE ARE   ibid 256 The quest ion facing those who design such penalties then is  one of how to create penalties that can deter crimes Penalties are thought  of as negative externalities they are what are like ly to accompany crimes  but as unwanted sideeffects at least in the criminals view The penal sys tem then must design negative externalities that will have the maxmimum  deterrence value   Of course deterrence itself has costs to the system These are opportun ity costs resources that are diverted from other possible social purposes  to those of deterring crime So the state must consider the best balance  between gaining deterrence by placing negative externalities on the one  hand and losing opportunities by a diversion of resources on the other  Those costs are then integrated into a supplydemand curve relative to  crime The enforcement of the law is the ensemble of instruments of  action on the criminal market that oppose to the snpply o f crime a negative  demand ibid 260   We are far removed here from the realm of discipline Where d iscip line  seeks to focus on each individual in order to modify their behaviour  neolibera lism attends to the general supply of crime Where d iscipline  works through training and normalization neoliberal ism works through  a calculation of rewards and costs Where discipline assumes a pliable  body that can be intervened upon neo libera lism assumes a homo  oeconomicus Where discipl ine seeks to el iminare crime neoliberalism  seeks an equilibrium between the supply curve of crime and negative  demand ibid 26 1 In short in contrast to discipline and normalization  neolibera lism seeks   a society in which there would be optlllliZation of systems of  difference  in which there wou ld be action taken not upon the  players but on the rules of play and finally in which there wou ld be  an intervention which would not be a type of subjectivization  asmjettissement interna l to individuals but instead an interven tion of an envi ronmental kind ibid 265   What are we to make of Foucaults analysis of neoliberal ism First it  should be noted that Foucault emphasizes that rhe neoliberal approach  remains in 1979 marginal to mainstream discourse It is not that nee liberalism has rep laced d iscip line and normalization rather it has arisen  as a form of govern mentality that competes with it Foucault is measuring  the rise of a view of the world of human beings of governing and of  economy that at the time he offers his lectures is beginn ing to have an  impact As we know the twin emergence of globalization and electronic  media has helped neoliberal doctrine move more rowards the mainstream   157     THE PHilOSOPHY OF FOUCAULT   of po litical and economic governmenra liry In this sense Foucault has fore seen changes rhar have become more sal ienr since the writing of Discipline  and Punish   These changes converge with those srudied by Deleuze Baudrillard and  Lyorard al though with rwo imporranr di fferences First they are seen as a  strand albeit an imporranr one in th inking abour who and where we are  now T he neoliberal approach is nor taken to be the whole cloth Although  Deleuze can admit rhar codes have nor enrirel rep laced normalization  Foucault by siruaring his analyses closer to the ground can show it And  by keeping ro the genea logical method Foucaul t can ask more precise  questions abour the place of neolibera lism in crea ting who we are and how  we think of ourselves than those thinkers who srand above or ourside the  derai ls of our history It is true rhar since 1979 the place of neoliberal ism  has become far less marginal than it was in Foucaults rime Bur again this  means that we need to conrinue his analyses nor abandon them   T he second difference and here the con trast with Baudrillard is particu larl y acure is rhar in the neo liberal view that Foucault describes homo  oeconomicus is not so much a consumer as an enrerprising capitalist  Homo oeconomicus   is not the man of exchange he is not the consum ing man he is the man of enrerprise and of production ibid  152 Yie  must be careful here Foucault is nor saying that who we have become is  enrirely homo oeconomicus Nor only is neoliberal theory nor in the  ascendance in 1979 but also the approach embraced by neoliberals must be  placed alongside other threads in order to reveal the character and even  the biopolirica l character of our world It is enrrely possible rhar in one  sense we are becoming consumers as much as producers and in another  we are becoming capitalist enrrepreneurs For instance Presidenr Bush s  recenr vision of an ownership society for all irs hypocrisy is an idea  that needs to be investigated from both the consumerist and the entrepren eurial perspectives My claim is not that Baudrillard is wrong here bur that  Foucaults conrriburion is nor reducible to his It approaches the emergence  of who we are from a differenr angle   We are left then wi th the question of who we are now In this chapter  we have surveyed those who would leave Foucault behind and I have  argued that there is still much to be gleaned from using Foucaults works  and particularly his method Yie have seen that Foucaul ts conrriburions  conrinue to have a grip on us Whoever we are we have not entirely shed  who we were nor has it been established that we have become something  unified that can be placed under a single descriptive or analytical category  Yie have not however settled the question of who we are now If Foucault  is right then we cannot appeal to his works uncritically in order to under stand ourse lves We are historical beings conringenr and changeable If we   158     ARE WE STILl WHO FOUCAUl T SAYS WE ARE   are to understand who we are who we are now it remains to us to ask  the question closely and vigi lantly To discover who we are to become who  we might be these are projects we are never done with In that sense  Foucaults work lies nor on ly wi th our past and with our present bur with  our future as well    159     Notes   Chapter 1

<BOS> 7192020 Broken Wings by Kahlil Gibran  newthoughtlibrarycomgibranKhalilbrokenWings 120  Broken Wings by Kahlil Gibran  Foreword  I was eighteen years of age when love opened my eyes with its magic rays and touched my spirit for the first time with its fiery fingers and Selma Karamy was the first woman who awakened my spirit with her beauty and led me into the garden of high affection where days pass like dreams and nights like weddings  Selma Karamy was the one who taught me to worship beauty by the example of her own beauty and revealed to me the secret of love by her affection se was the one who first sang to me the poetry of real life  A very young man remembers his first love and tries to recapture that strange hour the memory of which changes his deepest feeling and makes him so happy in spite of all the bitterness of its mystery  In every young mans life there is a Selma who appears to him suddenly while in the spring of life and transforms his solitude into happy moments and fills the silence of his nights with music  I was deeply engrossed in thought and contemplation and seeking to understand the meaning of nature and the revelation of books and scriptures when I heard LOVE whispered into my ears through Selmas lips My life was a coma empty like that of Adams in Paradise when I saw Selma standing before me like a column of light She was the Eve of my heart who filled it with secrets and wonders and made me understand the meaning of life  The first Eve led Adam out of Paradise by her own will while Selma made me enter willingly into the paradise of pure love and virtue by her sweetness and love but what happened to the first man also happened to me and the fiery word which chased Adam out of Paradise was like the one which frightened me by its glittering edge and forced me away from paradise of my love without having disobeyed any order or tasted the fruit of the forbidden tree  Today after many years have passed I have nothing left out of that beautiful dream except painful memories flapping like invisible wings around me filling the depths of my heart with sorrow and bringing tears to my eyes and my beloved beautiful Selma is dead and nothing is left to commemorate her except my broken heart and tomb surrounded by cypress trees That tomb and this heart are all that is left to bear witness of Selma  The silence that guards the tomb does not reveal Gods secret in the obscurity of the coffin and the rustling of the branches whose roots suck the bodys elements do not tell the mysteries of the grave by the agonized sighs of my heart announce to the living the drama which love beauty and death have performed  Oh friends of my youth who are scattered in the city of Beirut when you pass by the cemetery near the pine forest enter it silently and walk slowly so the tramping of your feet will not disturb the slumber of the dead and stop humbly by Selmas tomb and greet the earth that encloses her corpse and mention my name with deep sigh and say to yourself here all the hopes of Gibran who is living as prisoner of love beyond the seas were buried On this spot he lost his happiness drained his tears and forgot his smile  Ay that tomb grows Gibrans sorrow together with the cypress trees and above the tomb his spirit flickers every night commemorating Selma joining the branches of the trees in sorrowful wailing mourning and lamenting the going of Selma who yesterday was a beautiful tune on the lips of life and today is a silent secret in the bosom of the earth  Oh comrades of my youth I appeal to you in the names of those virgins whom your hearts have loved to lay a wreath of flowers on the forsaken tomb of my beloved for the flowers you lay on Selmas tomb are like falling drops of dew for the eyes of dawn on the leaves of withering rose  Return to the Top Return to the Top    7192020 Broken Wings by Kahlil Gibran  newthoughtlibrarycomgibranKhalilbrokenWings 220  Chapter 1  Silent Sorrow  My neighbors you remember the dawn of youth with pleasure and regret its passing but I remember it like a prisoner who recalls the bars and shackles of his jail You speak of those years between infancy and youth as a golden era free from confinement and cares but I call those years an era of silent sorrow which dropped as a seed into my heart and grew with it and could find no outlet to the world of Knowledge and wisdom until love came and opened the hearts doors and lighted its corners Love provided me with a tongue and tears You people remember the gardens and orchids and the meeting places and street corners that witnessed your games and heard your innocent whispering and I remember too the beautiful spot in North Lebanon Every time I close my eyes I see those valleys full of magic and dignity and those mountains covered with glory and greatness trying to reach the sky Every time I shut my ears to the clamor of the city I hear the murmur of the rivulets and the rustling of the branches All those beauties which I speak of now and which I long to see as a child longs for his mothers breast wounded my spirit imprisoned in the darkness of youth as a falcon suffers in its cage when it sees a flock of birds flying freely in the spacious sky Those valleys and hills fired my imagination but bitter thoughts wove round my heart a net of hopelessness  Every time I went to the fields I returned disappointed without understanding the cause of my disappointment Every time I looked at the gray sky I felt my heart contract Every time I heard the singing of the birds and babbling of the spring I suffered without understanding the reason for my suffering It is said that unsophistication makes a man empty and that emptiness makes him carefree It may be true among those who were born dead and who exist like frozen corpses but the sensitive boy who feels much and knows little is the most unfortunate creature under the sun because he is torn by two forces the first force elevates him and shows him the beauty of existence through a cloud of dreams the second ties him down to the earth and fills his eyes with dust and overpowers him with fears and darkness  Solitude has soft silky hands but with strong fingers it grasps the heart and makes it ache with sorrow Solitude is the ally of sorrow as well as a companion of spiritual exaltation  The boys soul undergoing the buffeting of sorrow is like a white lily just unfolding It trembles before the breeze and opens its heart to daybreak and folds its leaves back when the shadow of night comes If that boy does not have diversion or friends or companions in his games his life will be like a narrow prison in which he sees nothing but spiderwebs and hears nothing but the crawling of insects  That sorrow which obsessed me during my youth was not caused by lack of amusement because I could have had it neither from lack of friends because I could have found them That sorrow was caused by an inward ailment which made me love solitude It killed in me the inclination for games and amusement It removed from my shoulders the wings of youth and made me like a pong of water between mountains which reflects in its calm surface the shadows of ghosts and the colors of clouds and trees but cannot find an outlet by which to pass singing to the sea  Thus was my life before I attained the age of eighteen That year is like a mountain peak in my life for it awakened knowledge in me and made me understand the vicissitudes of mankind In that year I was reborn and unless a person is born again his life will remain like a blank sheet in the book of existence In that year I saw the angels of heaven looking at me through the eyes of a beautiful woman I also saw the devils of hell raging in the heart of an evil man He who does not see the angels and devils in the beauty and malice of life will be far removed from knowledge and his spirit will be empty of affection   Return to the Top Return to the Top  Chapter 2  The Hand of Destiny  In the spring of the that wonderful year I was in Beirut The gardens were full of Nisan flowers and the earth was carpeted with green grass and like a secret of earth revealed to Heaven The orange trees and apple trees looking like houris or brides sent by nature to inspire poets and excite the imagination were wearing white garments of perfumed blossoms  Spring is beautiful everywhere but it is most beautiful in Lebanon It is a spirit that roams round the earth but hovers over Lebanon conversing with kings and prophets singing with the rives the songs of Solomon and repeating with the Holy Cedars of Lebanon the memory of ancient glory Beirut free from the mud of winter and the dust of summer is like a bride in the spring or like a mermaid sitting by the side of a brook drying her smooth skin in the rays of the sun  One day in the month of Nisan I went to visit a friend whose home was at some distance from the glamorous city As we were conversing a dignified man of about sixtyfive entered the house As I rose to greet him my friend introduced him to me as Farris Effandi Karamy and then gave him my name with flattering words The old man looked at me a moment touching his forehead with the ends of his fingers as if he were trying to regain his memory Then he smilingly approached me saying  You are the son of a very dear friend of mine and I am happy to see that friend in your person  Much affected by his words I was attracted to him like a bird whose instinct leads him to his nest before the coming of the tempest As we sat down he told us about his friendship with my father recalling the time which they spent together An old man likes to return in memory to the days of his youth like a stranger who longs to go back to his own country He delights to tell stories of the past like a poet who takes pleasure in reciting his best poem He lives spiritually in the past because the present passes swiftly and    7192020 Broken Wings by Kahlil Gibran  newthoughtlibrarycomgibranKhalilbrokenWings 320  the future seems to him an approach to the oblivion of the grave An hour full of old memories passed like the shadows of the trees over the grass When Farris Effandi started to leave he put his left hand on my shoulder and shook my right hand saying  I have not seen your father for twenty years I hope you will l take his place in frequent visits to my house I promised gratefully to do my duty toward a dear friend of my father  When the old man left the house I asked my friend to tell me more about him He said I do not know any other man in Beirut whose wealth has made him kind and whose kindness has made him wealthy He is one of the few who come to this world and leave it without harming any one but people of that kind are usually miserable and oppressed because they are not clever enough to save themselves from the crookedness of others Farris Effandi has one daughter whose character is similar to his and whose beauty and gracefulness are beyond description and she will also be miserable because her fathers wealth is placing her already at the edge of a horrible precipice  As he uttered these words I noticed that his face clouded Then he continued Farris Effandi is a good old man with a noble heart but he lacks will power People lead him like a blind man His daughter obeys him in spite of her pride and intelligence and this is the secret which lurks in the life of father and daughter This secret was discovered by an evil man who is a bishop and whose wickedness hides in the shadow of his Gospel He makes the people believe that he is kind and noble He is the head of religion in this land of the religions The people obey and worship him He leads them like a flock of lambs to the slaughter house This bishop has a nephew who is full of hatefulness and corruption The day will come sooner or later when he will place his nephew on his right and Farris Effandis daughter on this left and holding with his evil hand the wreath of matrimony over their heads will tie a pure virgin to a filthy degenerate placing the heart of the day in the bosom of the night  That is all I can tell you about Farris Effandi and his daughter so do not ask me any more questions  Saying this he turned his head toward the window as if he were trying to solve the problems of human existence by concentrating on the beauty of the universe  As I left the house I told my friend that I was going to visit Farris Effandi in a few days for the purpose of fulfilling my promise and for the sake of the friendship which had joined him and my father He stared at me for a moment and I noticed a change in his expression as if my few simple words had revealed to him a new idea Then he looked straight through my eyes in a strange manner a look of love mercy and fear  the look of a prophet who foresees what no one else can divine Then his lips trembled a little but he said nothing when I started towards the door That strange look followed me the meaning of which I could not understand until I grew up in the world of experience where hearts understand each other intuitively and where spirits are mature with knowledge   Return to the Top Return to the Top  Chapter 3  Entrance to the Shrine  In a few days loneliness overcame me and I tired of the grim faces of books I hired a carriage and started for the house of Farris Effandi As i reached the pine woods where people went for picnics the driver took a private way shaded with willow trees on each side Passing through  we could see the beauty of the green grass the grapevines and the many colored flowers of Nisan just blossoming  In a few minutes the carriage stopped before a solitary house in the midst of a beautiful garden The scent of roses gardenia and jasmine filled the air As I dismounted and entered the spacious garden I saw Farris Effandi coming to meet me He ushered me into his house with a hearty welcome and sat by me like a happy father when he sees his son showering me with questions on my life future and education I answered him my voice full of ambition and zeal for I heard ringing in my ears the hymn of glory and I was sailing the calm sea of hopeful dreams Just then a beautiful young woman dressed in a gorgeous white silk gown appeared from behind the velvet curtains of the door and walked toward me Farris Effandi and I rose from our seats  This is my daughter Selma said the old man Then he introduced me to her saying Fate has brought back to me a dear old friend of mine in the person of his son Selma stared at me a moment as if doubting that a visitor could have entered their house Her hand when I touched it was like a white lily and a strange pang pierced my heart  We all sat silent as if Selma had brought into the room with her heavenly spirit worthy of mute respect As she felt the silence she smiled at me and said Many a times my father has repeated to me the stories of his youth and of the old days he and your father spent together If your father spoke to you in the same way then this meeting is not the first one between us  The old man was delighted to hear his daughter talking in such a manner and said Selma is very sentimental She sees everything through the eyes of the spirit Then he resumed his converstion with care and tact as if he had found in me a magic which took him on the wings of memory to the days of the past  As I considered him dreaming of my own later years he looked upon me as a lofty old tree that has withstood storms and sunshine throws its shadow upon a small sapling which shakes before the breeze of dawn  But Selma was silent Occasionally she looked first at me and then at her father as if reading the first and last chapters of lifes drama The day passed faster in that garden and I could see through the window the ghostly yellow kiss of sunset on the mountains    7192020 Broken Wings by Kahlil Gibran  newthoughtlibrarycomgibranKhalilbrokenWings 420  of Lebanon Farris Effandi continued to recount his experiences and I listened entranced and responded with such enthusiasm that his sorrow was changed to happiness  Selma sat by the window looking on with sorrowful eyes and not speaking although beauty has its own heavenly language loftier than the voices of tongues and lips It is a timeless language common to all humanity a calm lake that attracts the singing rivulets to its depth and makes them silent  Only our spirits can understand beauty or live and grow with it It puzzles our minds we are unable to describe it in words it is a sensation that our eyes cannot see derived from both the one who observes and the one who is looked upon Real beauty is a ray which emanates from the holy of holies of the spirit and illuminates the body as life comes from the depths of the earth and gives color and scent to a flower  Real beauty lies in the spiritual accord that is called love which can exist between a man and a woman  Did my spirit and Selmas reach out to each other that day when we met and did that yearning make me see her as the most beautiful woman under the sun Or was I intoxicated with the wine of youth which made me fancy that which never existed  Did my youth blind my natural eyes and make me imagine the brightness of her eyes the sweetness of her mouth and the grace of her figure Or was it that her brightness sweetness and grace opened my eyes and showed me the happiness and sorrow of love  It is hard to answer these questions but I say truly that in that hour I felt an emotion that I had never felt before a new affection resting calmly in my heart like the spirit hovering over the waters at the creation of the world and from that affection was born my happiness and my sorrow Thus ended the hour of my first meeting with Selma and thus the will of Heaven freed me from the bondage of youth and solitude and let me walk in the procession of love  Love is the only freedom in the world because it so elevates the spirit that the laws of humanity and the phenomena of nature do not alter its course  As I rose from my seat to depart Farris Effandi came close to me and said soberly Now my son since you know your way to this house you should come often and feel that you are coming to your fathers house Consider me as a father and Selma as a sister Saying this he turned to Selma as if to ask confirmation of his statement She nodded her head positively and then looked at me as one who has found an old acquaintance  Those words uttered by Farris Effandi Karamy placed me side by side with his daughter at the altar of love Those words were a heavenly song which started with exaltation and ended with sorrow they raised our spirits to the realm of light and searing flame they were the cup from which we drank happiness and bitterness  I left the house The old man accompanied me to the edge of the garden while my heart throbbed like the trembling lips of a thirsty man   Return to the Top Return to the Top  Chapter 4  The White Torch  The month of Nisan had nearly passed I continued to visit the home of Farris Effendi and to meet Selma in that beautiful garden gazing upon her beauty marveling at her intelligence and hearing the stillness of sorrow I felt an invisible hand drawing me to her  Every visit gave me a new meaning to her beauty and a new insight into her sweet spirit Until she became a book whose pages I could understand and whose praises I could sing but which I could never finish reading A woman whom Providence has provided with beauty of spirit and body is a truth at the same time both open and secret which we can understand only by love and touch only by virtue and when we attempt to describe such a woman she disappears like vapor  Selma Karamy had bodily and spiritual beauty but how can I describe her to one who never knew her Can a dead man remember the singing of a nightingale and the fragrance of a rose and the sigh of a brook Can a prisoner who is heavily loaded with shackles follow the breeze of the dawn Is not silence more painful than death Does pride prevent me from describing Selma in plain words since I cannot draw her truthfully with luminous colors A hungry man in a desert will not refuse to eat dry bread if Heaven does not shower him with manna and quails  In her white silk dress Selma was slender as a ray of moonlight coming through the window She walked gracefully and rhythmically Her voice was low and sweet words fell from her lips like drops of dew falling from the petals of flowers when they are disturbed by the wind  But Selmas face No words can describe its expression reflecting first great internal suffering then heavenly exaltation  The beauty of Selmas face was not classic it was like a dream of revelation which cannot be measured or bound or copied by the brush of a painter or the chisel of a sculptor Selmas beauty was not in her golden hair but in the virtue of purity which surrounded it not in her large eyes but in the light which emanated from them not in her red lips but in the sweetness of her words not in her ivory neck but in its slight bow to the front Nor was it in her perfect figure but in the nobility of her spirit burning like a white    7192020 Broken Wings by Kahlil Gibran  newthoughtlibrarycomgibranKhalilbrokenWings 520  torch between earth and sky Her beauty was like a gift of poetry But poets care unhappy people for no matter how high their spirits reach they will still be enclosed in an envelope of tears  Selma was deeply thoughtful rather than talkative and her silence was a kind of music that carried one to a world of dreams and made him listen to the throbbing of his heart and see the ghosts of his thoughts and feelings standing before him looking him in the eyes  She wore a cloak of deep sorrow through her life which increased her strange beauty and dignity as a tree in blossom is more lovely when seen through the mist of dawn  Sorrow linked her spirit and mine as if each saw in the others face what the heart was feeling and heard the echo of a hidden voice God had made two bodies in one and separation could be nothing but agony  The sorrowful spirit finds rest when united with a similar one They join affectionately as a stranger is cheered when he sees another stranger in a strange land Hearts that are united through the medium of sorrow will not be separated by the glory of happiness Love that is cleansed by tears will remain externally pure and beautiful      Return to the Top Return to the Top  Chapter 5  The Tempest  One day Farris Effandi invited me to dinner at his home I accepted my spirit hungry for the divine bread which Heaven placed in the hands of Selma the spiritual bread which makes our hearts hungrier the more we eat of it It was this bread which Kais the Arabian poet Dante and Sappho tasted and which set their hearts afar the bread which the Goddess prepares with the sweetness of kisses and the bitterness of tears  As I reached the home of Farris Effandi I saw Selma sitting on a bench in the garden resting her head against a tree and looking like a bride in her white silk dress or like a sentinel guarding that place  Silently and reverently I approached and sat by her I could not talk so I resorted to silence the only language of the heart but I felt that Selma was listening to my wordless call and watching the ghost of my soul in my eyes  In a few minutes the old man came out and greeted me as usual When he stretched his hand toward me I felt as if he were blessing the secrets that united me and his daughter Then he said Dinner is ready my children let us eat We rose and followed him and Selmas eyes brightened for a new sentiment had been added to her love by her fathers calling us his children  We sat at the table enjoying the food and sipping the old wine but our souls were living in a world far away We were dreaming of the future and its hardships  Three persons were separated in thoughts but united in love three innocent people with much feeling but little knowledge a drama was being performed by an old man who loved his daughter and cared for her happiness a young woman of twenty looking into the future with anxiety and a young man dreaming and worrying who had tasted neither the wine of life nor its vinegar and trying to reach the height of love and knowledge but unable to life himself up We three sitting in twilight were eating and drinking in that solitary home guarded by Heavens eyes but at the bottoms of our glasses were hidden bitterness and anguish  As we finished eating one of the maids announced the presence of a man at the door who wished to see Farris Effandi Who is he asked the old man The Bishops messenger said the maid There was a moment of silence during which Farris Effandi stared at his daughter like a prophet who gazes at Heaven to divine its secret Then he said to the maid Let the man in  As the maid left a man dressed in oriental uniform and with big mustache curled at the ends entered and greeted the old man saying His Grace the Bishop has sent me for you with his private carriage he wishes to discuss important business with you The old mans face clouded and his smile disappeared After a moment of deep thought he came close to me and said in a friendly voice I hope to find you here when I come back for Selma will enjoy your company in this solitary place  Saying this he turned to Selma and smiling asked if she agreed She nodded her head but her cheeks became red and with a voice sweeter than the music of the lyre she said I will do my best Father to make our guest happy  Selma watched the carriage that had taken her father and the Bishops messenger until it disappeared Then she came and sat opposite me on a divan covered with green silk She looked like a lily bent to the carpet of green grass by the breeze of dawn It was the will of Heaven that I should be with Selma alone at night in her beautiful home surrounded by trees where silence love beauty and virtue dwelt together  We were both silent each waiting for the other to speak but speech is not the only means of understanding between two souls It is not the syllables that come from the lips and tongues that bring hearts together    7192020 Broken Wings by Kahlil Gibran  newthoughtlibrarycomgibranKhalilbrokenWings 620  There is something greater and purer than what the mouth utters Silence illuminates our souls whispers to our hearts and brings them together Silence separates us from ourselves makes us sail the firmament of spirit and brings us closer to Heaven it makes us feel that bodies are no more than prisons and that this world is only a place of exile  Selma looked at me and her eyes revealed the secret of her heart Then she quietly said Let us go to the garden and sit under the trees and watch the moon come up behind the mountains Obediently I rose from my seat but I hesitated  Dont you think we had better stay here until the moon has risen and illuminates the garden And I continued The darkness hides the trees and flowers We can see nothing  Then she said If darkness hides the trees and flowers from our eyes it will not hide love from our hearts  Uttering these words in a strange tone she turned her eyes and looked through the window I remained silent pondering her words weighing the true meaning of each syllable Then she looked at me as if she regretted what she had said and tried to take away those words from my ears by the magic of her eyes But those eyes instead of making me forget what she had said repeated through the depths of my heart more clearly and effectively the sweet words which had already become graven in my memory for eternity  Every beauty and greatness in this world is created by a single thought or emotion inside a man Every thing we see today made by past generation was before its appearance a thought in the mind of a man or an impulse in the heart of a woman The revolutions that shed so much blood and turned mens minds toward liberty were the idea of one man who lived in the midst of thousands of men The devastating wars which destroyed empires were a thought that existed in the mind of an individual The supreme teachings that changed the course of humanity were the ideas of a man whose genius separated him from his environment A single thought build the Pyramids founded the glory of Islam and caused the burning of the library at Alexandria  One thought will come to you at night which will elevate you to glory or lead you to asylum One look from a womans eye makes you the happiest man in the world One word from a mans lips will make you rich or poor  That word which Selma uttered that night arrested me between my past and future as a boat which is anchored in the midst of the ocean That word awakened me from the slumber of youth and solitude and set me on the stage where life and death play their parts  The scent of flowers mingled with the breeze as we came into the garden and sat silently on a bench near a jasmine tree listening to the breathing of sleeping nature while in the blue sky the eyes of heaven witnessed our drama  The moon came out from behind Mount Sannin and shone over the coast hills and mountains and we could see the villages fringing the valley like apparitions which have suddenly been conjured from nothing We could see the beauty of Lebanon under the silver rays of the moon  Poets of the West think of Lebanon as a legendary place forgotten since the passing of David and Solomon and the Prophets as the Garden of Eden became lost after the fall of Adam and Eve To those Western poets the word Lebanon is a poetical expression associated with a mountain whose sides are drenched with the incense of the Holy Cedars It reminds them of the temples of copper and marble standing stern and impregnable and of a herd of deer feeding in the valleys That night I saw Lebanon dreamlike with the eyes of a poet  Thus the appearance of things changes according to the emotions and thus we see magic and beauty in them while the magic and beauty are really in ourselves  As the rays of the moon shone on the face neck and arms of Selma she looked like a statue of ivory sculptured by the fingers of some worshiper of Ishtar goddess of beauty and love As she looked at me she said Why are you silent Why do you not tell me something about your past As I gazed at her my muteness vanished and I opened my lips and said Did you not hear what I said when we came to this orchard The spirit that hears the whispering of flowers and the singing of silence can also hear the shrieking of my soul and the clamor of my heart  She covered her face with her hands and said in a trembling voice Yes I heard you  I heard a voice coming from the bosom of night and a clamor raging in the heart of the day  Forgetting my past my very existence  everything but Selma  I answered her saying And I heard you too Selma I heard exhilarating music pulsing in the air and causing the whole universe to tremble  Upon hearing these words she closed her eyes and her lips I saw a smile of pleasure mingled with sadness She whispered softly Now I know that there is something higher than heaven and deeper than the ocean and stranger than life and death and time I know now what I did not know before  At that moment Selma became dearer than a friend and closer than a sister and more beloved than a sweetheart She became a supreme thought a beautiful an overpowering emotion living in my spirit  It is wrong to think that love comes from long companionship and persevering courtship Love is the offspring of spiritual affinity and unless that affinity is created in a moment it will not be created in years or even generations  Then Selma raised her head and gazed at the horizon where Mount Sannin meets the sky and said Yesterday you were like a brother to me with whom I lived and by whom I sat calmly under my fathers care Now I feel the presence of something stranger and sweeter than brotherly affection an unfamiliar commingling of love and fear that fills my heart with sorrow and happiness    7192020 Broken Wings by Kahlil Gibran  newthoughtlibrarycomgibranKhalilbrokenWings 720  I responded This emotion which we fear and which shakes us when it passes through our hearts is the law of nature that guides the moon around the earth and the sun around the God  She put her hand on my head and wove her fingers thought my hair Her face brightened and tears came out of her eyes like drops of dew on the leaves of a lily and she said Who would believe our story  who would believe that in this hour we have surmounted the obstacles of doubt Who would believe that the month of Nisan which brought us together for the first time is the month that halted us in the Holy of Holies of life  Her hand was still on my head as she spoke and I would not have preferred a royal crown or a wreath of glory to that beautiful smooth hand whose fingers were twined in my hair  Then I answered her People will not believe our story because they do not know what love is the only flower that grows and blossoms without the aid of seasons but was it Nisan that brought us together for the first time and is it this hour that has arrested us in the Holy of Holies of life Is it not the hand of God that brought our souls close together before birth and made us prisoners of each other for all the days and nights Mans life does not commence in the womb and never ends in the grave and this firmament full of moonlight and stars is not deserted by loving souls and intuitive spirits  As she drew her hand away from my head I felt a kind of electrical vibration at the roots of my hair mingled with the night breeze Like a devoted worshiper who receives his blessing by kissing the altar in a shrine I took Selmas hand placed my burning lips on it and gave it a long kiss the memory of which melts my heart and awakens by its sweetness all the virtue of my spirit  An hour passed every minute of which was a year of love The silence of the night moonlight flowers and trees made us forget all reality except love when suddenly we heard the galloping of horses and rattling of carriage wheels Awakened from our pleasant swoon and plunged from the world of dreams into the world of perplexity and misery we found that the old man had returned from his mission We rose and walked through the orchard to meet him  Then the carriage reached the entrance of the garden Farris Effandi dismounted and slowly walked towards us bending forward slightly as if he were carrying a heavy load He approached Selma and placed both of his hands on her shoulders and stared at her Tears coursed down his wrinkled cheeks and his lips trembled with sorrowful smile In a choking voice he said My beloved Selma very soon you will be taken away from the arms of your father to the arms of another man Very soon fate will carry you from this lonely home to the worlds spacious court and this garden will miss the pressure of your footsteps and your father will become a stranger to you All is done may God bless you  Hearing these words Selmas face clouded and her eyes froze as if she felt a premonition of death Then she screamed like a bird shot down suffering and trembling and in a choked voice said What do you say What do you mean Where are you sending me  Then she looked at him searchingly trying to discover his secret In a moment she said I understand I understand everything The Bishop has demanded me from you and has prepared a cage for this bird with broken wings Is this your will Father  His answer was a deep sigh Tenderly he led Selma into the house while I remained standing in the garden waves of perplexity beating upon me like a tempest upon autumn leaves Then I followed them into the living room and to avoid embarrassment shook the old mans hand looked at Selma my beautiful star and left the house  As I reached the end of the garden I heard the old man calling me and turned to meet him Apologetically he took my hand and said Forgive me my son I have ruined your evening with the shedding of tears but please come to see me when my house is deserted and I am lonely and desperate Youth my dear son does not combine with senility as morning does not have meet the night but you will come to me and call to my memory the youthful days which I spent with your father and you will tell me the news of life which does not count me as among its sons any longer Will you not visit me when Selma leaves and I am left here in loneliness  While he said these sorrowful words and I silently shook his hand I felt the warm tears falling from his eyes upon my hand Trembling with sorrow and filial affection I felt as if my heart were choked with grief When I raised my head and he saw the tears in my eyes he bent toward me and touched my forehead with his lips Goodbye son Goodbye  An old mans tear is more potent than that of a young man because it is the residuum of life in his weakening body A young mans tear is like a drop of dew on the leaf of a rose while that of an old man is like a yellow leaf which falls with the wind at the approach of winter  As I left the house of Farris Effandi Karamy Selmas voice still rang in my ears her beauty followed me like a wraith and her fathers tears dried slowly on my hand  My departure was like Adams exodus from Paradise but the Eve of my heart was not with me to make the whole world an Eden That night in which I had been born again I felt that I saw deaths face for the first time  Thus the sun enlivens and kills the fields with its heat      Return to the Top Return to the Top    7192020 Broken Wings by Kahlil Gibran  newthoughtlibrarycomgibranKhalilbrokenWings 820  Chapter 6  Lake of Fire  Everything that a man does secretly in the darkness of night will be clearly revealed in the daylight Words uttered in privacy will become unexpectedly common conversation Deed which we hide today in the corners of our lodgings will be shouted on every street tomorrow  Thus the ghosts of darkness revealed the purpose of Bishop Bulos Galibs meeting with Farris Effandi Karamy and his conversation was repeated all over the neighborhood until it reached my ears  The discussion that took place between Bishop Buols Galib and Farris Effandi that night was not over the problems of the poor or the widows and orphans The main purpose for sending after Farris Effandi and bringing him in the Bishops private carriage was the betrothal of Selma to the Bishops nephew Mansour Bey Galib  Selma was the only child of the wealthy Farris Effandi and the Bishops choice fell on Selma not on account of her beauty and noble spirit but on account of her fathers money which would guarantee Mansour Bey a good and prosperous fortune and make him an important man  The heads of religion in the East are not satisfied with their own munificence but they must strive to make all members of their families superiors and oppressors The glory of a prince goes to his eldest son by inheritance but the exaltation of a religious head is contagious among his brothers and nephews Thus the Christian bishop and the Moslem imam and the Brahman priest become like sea reptiles who clutch their prey with many tentacles and suck their blood with numerous mouths  When the Bishop demanded Selmas hand for his nephew the only answer that he received from her father was a deep silence and falling tears for he hated to lose his only child Any mans soul trembles when he is separated from his only daughter whom he has reared to young womanhood  The sorrow of parents at the marriage of a daughter is equal to their happiness at the marriage of a son because a son brings to the family a new member while a daughter upon her marriage is lost to them  Farris Effandi perforce granted the Bishops request obeying his will unwillingly because Farris Effandi knew the Bishops nephew very well knew that he was dangerous full of hate wickedness and corruption  In Lebanon no Christian could oppose his bishop and remain in good standing No man could disobey his religious head and keep his reputation The eye could not resist a spear without being pierced and the hand could not grasp a sword without being cut off  Suppose that Farris Effandi had resisted the Bishop and refused his wish then Selmas reputation would have been ruined and her name would have been blemished by the dirt of lips and tongues In the opinion of the fox high bunches of grapes that cant be reached are sour  Thus destiny seized Selma and led her like a humiliated slave in the procession of miserable oriental woman and thus fell that noble spirit into the trap after having flown freely on the white wings of love in a sky full of moonlight scented with the odor of flowers  In some countries the parents wealth is a source of misery for the children The wide strong box which the father and mother together have used for the safety of their wealth becomes a narrow dark prison for the souls of their heirs The Almighty Dinar which the people worship becomes a demon which punished the spirit and deadens the heart Selma Karamy was one of those who were the victims of their parents wealth and bridegrooms cupidity Had it not been for her fathers wealth Selma would still be living happily  A week had passed The love of Selma was my sole entertainer singing songs of happiness for me at night and waking me at dawn to reveal the meaning of life and the secrets of nature It is a heavenly love that is free from jealousy rich and never harmful to the spirit It is deep affinity that bathes the soul in contentment a deep hunger for affection which when satisfied fills the soul with bounty a tenderness that creates hope without agitating the soul changing earth to paradise and life to a sweet and a beautiful dream In the morning when I walked in the fields I saw the token of Eternity in the awakening of nature and when I sat by the seashore I heard the waves singing the song of Eternity And when I walked in the streets I saw the beauty of life and the splendor of humanity in the appearance of passersby and movements of workers  Those days passed like ghosts and disappeared like clouds and soon nothing was left for me but sorrowful memories The eye with which I used to look at the beauty of spring and the awakening of nature could see nothing but the fury of the tempest and the misery of winter The ears with which I formerly heard with delight the song of the waves could hear only the howling of the wind and the wrath of the sea against the precipice The soul which had observed happily the tireless vigor of mankind and the glory of the universe was tortured by the knowledge of disappointment and failure Nothing was more beautiful than those days of love and nothing was more bitter than those horrible nights of sorrow  When I could no longer resist the impulse i went on the weekend once more to Selmas home  the shrine which Beauty had erected and which Love had blessed in which the spirit could worship and the heart kneel humbly and pray When I entered the garden I felt a power pulling me away from this world and placing me in a sphere supernaturally free from struggle and hardship Like a mystic who receives a revelation of Heaven I saw myself amid the trees and flowers and as I approached the entrance of the house I beheld Selma sitting on the bench in the shadow of a jasmine tree where we both had sat the week before on that night which Providence had chosen for the beginning of my happiness and sorrow    7192020 Broken Wings by Kahlil Gibran  newthoughtlibrarycomgibranKhalilbrokenWings 920  She neither moved nor spoke as I approached her She seemed to have known intuitively that I was coming and when I sat by her she gazed at me for a moment and sighed deeply then turned her head and looked at the sky And after a moment full of magic silence she turned back toward me and tremblingly took my hand and said in a faint voice Look at me my friend study my face and I read in it that which you want to know and which I can not recite Look at me my beloved look at me my brother  I gazed at her intently and saw that those eyes which a few days ago were smiling like lips and moving like the wings of a nightingale eyes were already sunken and glazed with sorrow and pain Her face that had resembled the unfolding sunkissed leaves of a lily had faded and become colorless Her sweet lips were like two withering roses that autumn has left on their stems Her neck that had been a column of ivory was bent forward as if it no longer could support the burden of grief in her head  All these changes I saw in Selmas face but to me they were like a passing cloud that covered the face of the moon and makes it more beautiful A look which reveals inward stress adds more beauty to the face no matter how much tragedy and pain it bespeaks but the face which in silence does not announce hidden mysteries is not beautiful regardless of the symmetry of its features The cup does not entice our lips unless the wines color is seen through the transparent crystal  Selma on that evening was like a cup full of heavenly wine concocted of the bitterness and sweetness of life Unaware she symbolized the oriental woman who never leaves her parents home until she puts upon her neck the heavy yoke of her husband who never leaves her loving mothers arms until she must live as a slave enduring the harshness of her husbands mother  I continued to look at Selma and listen to her depressed spirit and suffer with her until I felt that time has ceased and the universe had faded from existence I could see only her two large eyes staring fixedly at me and could feel only her cold trembling hand holding mine  I woke from my swoon hearing Selma saying quietly Come by beloved let us discuss the horrible future before it comes My father has just left the house to see the man who is going to be my companion until death My father whom God chose for the purpose of my existence will meet the man whom the world has selected to be my master for the rest of my life In the heart of this city the old man who accompanied me during my youth will meet the young man who will be my companion for the coming years Tonight the two families will set the marriage date What a strange and impressive hour Last week at this time under this jasmine tree Love embraced my soul for the first time okay While Destiny was writing the first word of my lifes story at the Bishops mansion Now while my father and my suitor are planning the day of marriage I see your spirit quivering around me as a thirsty bird flickers above a spring of water guarded by a hungry serpent Oh how great this night is And how deep is its mystery  Hearing these words I felt that dark ghost of complete despondency was seizing our love to choke it in its infancy and I answered her That bird will remain flickering over that spring until thirst destroys him or falls into the grasp of a serpent and becomes its prey  She responded No my beloved this nightingale should remain alive and sing until dark comes until spring passes until the end of the world and keep on singing eternally His voice should not be silenced because he brings life to my heart his wings should not be broken because their motion removes the cloud from my heart  Then I whispered Selma my beloved thirst will exhaust him and fear will kill him  She replied immediately with trembling lips The thirst of soul is sweeter than the wine of material things and the fear of spirit is dearer than the security of the body But listen my beloved listen carefully I am standing today at the door of a new life which I know nothing about I am like a blind man who feels his way so that he will not fall My fathers wealth has placed me in the slave market and this man has bought me I neither know nor love him but I shall learn to love him and I shall obey him serve him and make him happy I shall give him all that a weak woman can give a strong man  But you my beloved are still in the prime of life You can walk freely upon lifes spacious path carpeted with flowers You are free to traverse the world making of your heart a torch to light your way You can think talk and act freely you can write your name on the face of life because you are a man you can live as a master because your fathers wealth will not place you in the slave market to be bought and sold you can marry the woman of your choice and before she lives in your home you can let her reside in your heart and can exchange confidences without hindrances  Silence prevailed for a moment and Selma continued But is it now that Life will tear us apart so that you may attain the glory of a man and I the duty of a woman Is it for this that the valley swallows the song of the nightingale in its depths and the wind scatters the petals of the rose and the feet tread upon the wind cup Were all those nights we spent in the moonlight by the jasmine tree where our souls united in vain Did we fly swiftly toward the stars until our wings tired and are we descending now into the abyss Or was Love asleep when he came to us and did he when he woke become angry and decide to punish us Or did our spirits turn the nights breeze into a wind that tore us to pieces and blew us like dust to the depth of the valley We disobeyed no commandment nor did we taste of forbidden fruit so what is making us leave this paradise We never conspired or practiced mutiny then why are we descending to hell No no the moments which united us are greater than centuries and the light that illuminated our spirits is stronger than the dark and if the tempest separates us on this rough ocean the waves will unite us on the calm shore and if this life kills us death will unite us A womans heart will change with time or season even if it dies eternally it will never perish A womans heart is like a field turned into a battleground after the trees are uprooted and the grass is burned and the rocks are reddened with blood and the earth is planted with bones and skulls it is calm and silent as if nothing has happened for the spring and autumn come at their intervals and resume their work  And now my beloved what shall we do How shall we part and when shall we meet Shall we consider love a strange visitor who came in the evening and left us in the morning Or shall we suppose this affection a dream that came in our sleep and departed when    7192020 Broken Wings by Kahlil Gibran  newthoughtlibrarycomgibranKhalilbrokenWings 1020  we awoke  Shall we consider this week an hour of intoxication to be replaced by soberness Raise your head and let me look at you my beloved open your lips and let me hear your voice Speak to me Will you remember me after this tempest has sunk the ship of our love Will you hear the whispering of my wings in the silence of the night Will you hear my spirit fluttering over you Will you listen to my sighs Will you see my shadow approach with the shadows of dusk and disappear with the flush of dawn Tell me my beloved what will you be after having been magic ray to my eyes sweet song to my ears and wings to my soul What will you be  Hearing these words my heart melted and I answered her  I will be as you want me to be my beloved  Then she said  I want you to love me as a poet loves his sorrowful thoughts I want you to remember me as a traveler remembers a calm pool in which his image was reflected as he drank its water I want you to remember me as a mother remember her child that died before it saw the light and I want you to remember me as a merciful king remembers a prisoner who died before his pardon reached him I want you to be my companion and I want you to visit my father and console him in his solitude because I shall be leaving him soon and shall be a stranger to him I answered her saying  I will do all you have said and will make my soul an envelope for your soul and my heart a residence for your beauty and my breast a grave for your sorrows I shall love you Selma as the prairies love the spring and I shall live in you in the life of a flower under the suns rays I shall sing your name as the valley sings the echo of the bells of the village churches I shall listen to the language of your soul as the shore listens to the story of the waves I shall remember you as a stranger remembers his beloved country and as a hungry man remembers a banquet and as a dethroned king remembers the days of his glory and as a prisoner remembers the hours of ease and freedom I shall remember you as a sower remembers the bundles of wheat on his threshing flour and as a shepherd remembers the green prairies the sweet brooks  Selma listened to my words with palpitating heart and said Tomorrow the truth will become ghostly and the awakening will be like a dream Will a lover be satisfied embracing a ghost or will a thirsty man quench his thirst from the spring or a dream  I answered her Tomorrow destiny will put you in the midst of a peaceful family but it will send me into the world of struggle and warfare You will be in the home of a person whom chance has made most fortunate through your beauty and virtue while I shall be living a life of suffering and fear You will enter the gate of life while I shall enter the gate of death You will be received hospitably while I shall exist in solitude but I shall erect a statue of love and worship it in the valley of death Love will be my sole comforter and I shall drink love like wine and wear it like garment At dawn Love will wake me from slumber and take me to the distant field and at noon will lead me to the shadows of trees where I will find shelter with the birds from the heat of the sun In the evening it will cause me to pause before sunset to hear natures farewell song to the light of day and will show me ghostly clouds sailing in the sky At night Love will embrace me and I shall sleep dreaming of the heavenly world where the spirits of lovers and poets abide In the Spring I shall walk side by side with love among violets and jasmines and drink the remaining drops of winter in the lily cups In Summer we shall make the bundles of hay our pillows and the grass our bed and the blue sky will cover us as we gaze at the stars and the moon  In Autumn Love and I will go to the vineyard and sit by the wine press and watch the grapevines being denuded of their golden ornaments and the migrating flocks of birds will wing over us In Winter we shall sit by the fireside reciting stories of long ago and chronicles of far countries During my youth Love will be my teacher in middle age my help and in old age my delight Love my beloved Selma will stay with me to the end of my life and after death the hand of God will unite us again  All these words came from the depths of my heart like flames of fire which leap raging from the hearth and then disappear in the ashes Selma was weeping as if her eyes were lips answering me with tears  Those whom love has not given wings cannot fly the cloud of appearances to see the magic world in which Selmas spirit and mine existed together in that sorrowfully happy hour Those whom Love has not chosen as followers do not hear when Love calls This story is not for them Even if they should comprehend these pages they would not be able to grasp the shadowy meanings which are not clothed in words and do not reside on paper but what human being is he who has never sipped the wine from the cup of love and what spirit is it that has never stood reverently before that lighted altar in the temple whose pavement is the hearts of men and women and whose ceiling is the secret canopy of dreams What flower is that on whose leaves the dawn has never poured a drop of dew what streamlet is that which lost its course without going to the sea  Selma raised her face toward the sky and gazed at the heavenly stars which studded the firmament She stretched out her hands her eyes widened and her lips trembled On her pale face I could see the signs of sorrow oppression hopelessness and pain Then she cried  Oh Lord what has a woman done that hath offended Thee What sin has she committed to deserve such a punishment For what crime has she been awarded everlasting castigation Oh Lord Thou art strong and I am weak Why hast Thou made me suffer pain Thou art great and almighty while I am nothing but a tiny creature crawling before Thy throne Why hast Thou crushed me with Thy foot Thou art a raging tempest and I am like dust why my Lord hast Thou flung me upon the cold earth Thou art powerful and I am helpless why art Thou fighting me Thou art considerate and I am prudent why art Thou destroying me Thou hast created woman with love and why with love dost Thou ruin her With Thy right hand dost Thou lift her and with Thy left hand dost Thou strike her into the abyss and she knows not why In her mouth Thou blowest the breath of Life and in her heart Thou sowest the seeds of death Thou dost show her the path of happiness but Thou leadest her in the road of misery in her mouth Thou dost place a song of happiness but then Thou dost close her lips with sorrow and dost fetter her tongue with agony With Thy mysterious fingers dost Thou dress her wounds and with Thine hands Thou drawest the dread of pain round her pleasures In her bed Thou hidest pleasure and peace but beside it Thou dost erect obstacles and fear Thou dost excite her affection through Thy will and from her affection does shame emanate By Thy will Thou showest her the beauty of creation but her love for beauty becomes a terrible famine Thou dost make her drink life in the cup of death and death in the cup of life Thou purifiest her with tears and in tears her life streams away Oh Lord Thou hast opened my eyes with love and with love Thou hast blinded me Thou hast kissed me    7192020 Broken Wings by Kahlil Gibran  newthoughtlibrarycomgibranKhalilbrokenWings 1120  with Thy lips and struck me with Thy strong hand Thou has planted in my heart a white rose but around the rose a barrier of thorns Thou hast tied my present with the spirit of a young man whom I love but my life with the body of an unknown man So help me my Lord to be strong in this deadly struggle and assist me to be truthful and virtuous until death Thy will be done Oh  Lord God  Silence continued Selma looked down pale and frail her arms dropped and her head bowed and it seemed to me as if a tempest had broken a branch from a tree and cast it down to dry and perish  I took her cold hand and kissed it but when I attempted to console her it was I who needed consolation more than she did I kept silent thinking of our plight and listening to my heartbeats Neither of us said more  Extreme torture is mute and so we sat silent petrified like columns of marble buried under the sand of an earthquake Neither wished to listen to the other because our heartthreads had become weak and even breathing would have broken them  It was midnight and we could see the crescent moon rising from behind Mount Sannin and it looked in the midst of the stars like the face of a corpse in a coffin surrounded by the dim lights of candles And Lebanon looked like an old man whose back was bent with age and whose eyes were a haven for insomnia watching the dark and waiting for dawn like asking sitting on the ashes of his throne in the debris of his palace  The mountains trees and rivers change their appearance with the vicissitudes of times and seasons as a man changes with his experiences and emotions The lofty poplar that resembles a bride in the daytime will look like a column of smoke in the evening the huge rock that stands impregnable at noon will appear to be a miserable pauper at night with earth for his bed and the sky for his cover and the rivulet that we see glittering in the morning and hear singing the hymn of Eternity will in the evening turn to a stream of tears wailing like a mother bereft of her child and Lebanon that had looked dignified a week before when the moon was full and our spirits were happy looked sorrowful and lonesome that night  He stood up and bade each other farewell but love and despair stood between us like two ghosts one stretching his wings with his fingers over our throats one weeping and the other laughing hideously  As I took Selmas hand and put it to my lips she came close to me and placed a kiss on my forehead then dropped on the wooden bench She shut her eyes and whispered softly Oh Lord God have mercy on me and mend my broken wings  As I left Selma in the garden I felt as if my senses were covered with a thick veil like a lake whose surface is concealed by fog  The beauty of trees the moonlight the deep silence everything about me looked ugly and horrible The true light that had showed me the beauty and wonder of the universe was converted to a great flame of fire that seared my heart and the Eternal music I used to hear became a clamor more frightening than the roar of a lion  I reached my room and like a wounded bird shot down by a hunter I fell on my bed repeating the words of Selma Oh Lord God have mercy on me and mend my broken wings  Return to the Top Return to the Top  Chapter 7  Before the Throne of Death  Marriage in these days is a mockery whose management is in the hands of young men and parents In most countries the young men win while the parents lose The woman is looked upon as a commodity purchased and delivered from one house to another In time her beauty fades and she becomes like an old piece of furniture left in a dark corner  Modern civilization has made woman a little wiser but it has increased her suffering because of mans covetousness The woman of yesterday was a happy wife but the woman of today is a miserable mistress In the past she walked blindly in the light but now she walks openeyed in the dark She was beautiful in her ignorance virtuous in her simplicity and strong in her weakness Today she has become ugly in her ingenuity superficial and heartless in her knowledge Will the day ever come when beauty and knowledge ingenuity and virtue and weakness of body and strength of spirit will be united in a woman  I am one of those who believe that spiritual progress is a rule of human life but the approach to perfection is slow and painful If a woman elevates herself in one respect and is retarded in another it is because the rough trail that leads to the mountain peak is not free of ambushes of thieves and lairs of wolves  This strange generation exists between sleeping and waking It holds in its hands the soil of the past and the seeds of the future However we find in every city a woman who symbolizes the future  In the city of Beirut Selma Karamy was the symbol of the future Oriental woman but like many who lie ahead of their time she became the victim of the present and like a flower snatched from its stem and carried away by the current of a river she walked in the miserable procession of the defeated    7192020 Broken Wings by Kahlil Gibran  newthoughtlibrarycomgibranKhalilbrokenWings 1220  Mansour Bey Galib and Selma were married and lived together in a beautiful house at Ras Beyrouth where all the wealthy dignitaries resided Farris Effandi Karamy was left in his solitary home in the midst of his garden and orchards like a lonely shepherd amid his flock  The days and merry nights of the wedding passed but the honeymoon left memories of times of bitter sorrow as wars leave skulls and dead bones on the battlefield The dignity of an Oriental wedding inspires the hearts of young men and women but its termination may drop them like millstones to the bottom of the sea Their exhilaration is like footprints on sand which remain only till they are washed away by the waves  Spring departed and so did summer and autumn but my love for Selma increased day by day until it became a kind of mute worship the feeling that an orphan has toward the soul of his mother in Heaven My yearning was converted to blind sorrow that could see nothing but itself and the passion that drew tears from my eyes was replaced by perplexity that sucked the blood from my heart and my sighs of affection became a constant prayer for the happiness of Selma and her husband and peace for her father  My hopes and prayers were in vain because Selmas misery was an internal malady that nothing but death could cure  Mansour Bey was a man to whom all the luxuries of life came easily but in spite of that he was dissatisfied and rapacious After marrying Selma he neglected her father in his loneliness and prayed for his death so that he could inherit what was left of the old mans wealth  Mansour Beys character was similar to his uncles the only difference between the two was that the Bishop got everything he wanted secretly under the protection of his ecclesiastical robe and the golden cross which he wore on his chest while his nephew did everything publicly The Bishop went to church in the morning and spent the rest of the day pilfering from the widows orphans and simple minded people But Mansour Bey spent his days in pursuit of sexual satisfaction On Sunday Bishop Bulos Galib preached his Gospel but during weekdays he never practiced what he preached occupying himself with political intrigues of the locality And by means of his uncles prestige and influence Mansour Bey made it his business to secure political plums for those who could offer a sufficient bribe  Bishop Bulos was a thief who hid himself under the cover of night while his nephew Mansour Bey was a swindler who walked proudly in daylight However the people of Oriental nations place trust in such as theywolves and butchers who ruin their country through covetousness and crush their neighbors with an iron hand  Why do I occupy these pages with words about the betrayers of poor nations instead of reserving all the space for the story of a miserable woman with a broken heart Why do I shed tears for oppressed peoples rather than keep all my tears for the memory of a weak woman whose life was snatched by the teeth of death  But my dear readers dont you think that such a woman is like a nation that is oppressed by priests and rulers Dont you believe that thwarted love which leads a woman to the grave is like the despair which pervades the people of the earth A woman is to a nation as light is to a lamp Will not the light be dim if the oil in the lamp is low  Autumn passed and the wind blew the yellow leaves form the trees making way for winter which came howling and crying I was still in the City of Beirut without a companion save my dreams which would lift my spirit to the sky and then bury it deep in the bosom of the earth  The sorrowful spirit finds relaxation in solitude It abhors people as a wounded deer deserts the herd and lives in a cave until it is healed or dead  One day I heard Farris Effandi was ill I left my solitary abode and walked to his home taking a new route a lonely path between olive trees avoiding the main road with its rattling carriage wheels  Arriving at the old mans house I entered and found Farris Effandi lying on his bed weak and pale His eyes were sunken and looked like two deep dark valleys haunted by the ghosts of pain The smile which had always enlivened his face was choked with pain and agony and the bones of his gentle hands looked like naked branches trembling before the tempest As I approached him and inquired as to his health he turned his pale face toward me and on his trembling lips appeared a smile and he said in a weak voice Go  go my son to the other room and comfort Selma and bring her to sit by the side of my bed  I entered the adjacent room and found Selma lying on a divan covering her head with her arms and burying her face in a pillow so that her father would not hear her weeping Approaching slowly I pronounced her name in a voice that seemed more like sighing than whispering She moved fearfully as if she had been interrupted in a terrible dream and sat up looking at me with glazed eyes doubting whether I was a ghost or a living being After a deep silence which took us back on the wings of memory to that hour when we were intoxicated with wine of love Selma wiped away her tears and said See how time has changed us See how time has changed the course of our lives and left us in these ruins In this place spring united us in a bond of love and in this place has brought us together before the throne of death How beautiful was spring and how terrible is this winter  Speaking thus she covered her face again with her hands as if she were shielding her eyes from the specter of the past standing before her I put my hand on her head and said Come Selma come and let us be as strong towers before the tempest Let us stand like brave soldiers before the enemy and face his weapons If we are killed we shall die as martyrs and if we win we shall live as heroes Braving obstacles and hardships is nobler than retreat to tranquility The butterfly that hovers around the lamp until it dies is more admirable than the mole that lives in a dark tunnel Come Selma let us walk this rough path firmly with our eyes toward the sun so that we may not see the skulls and serpents among the rocks and thorns If fear should stop us in middle of the road we    7192020 Broken Wings by Kahlil Gibran  newthoughtlibrarycomgibranKhalilbrokenWings 1320  would hear only ridicule from the voices of the night but if we reach the mountain peak bravely we shall join the heavenly spirits in songs of triumph and joy Cheer up Selma wipe away your tears and remove the sorrow from your face Rise and let us sit by the bed of your father because his life depends on your life and your smile is his only cure  Kindly and affectionately she looked at me and said Are you asking me to have patience while you are in need of it yourself Will a hungry man give his bread to another hungry man Or will sick man give medicine to another which he himself needs badly  She rose her head bent slightly forward and we walked to the old mans room and sat by the side of his bed Selma forced a smile and pretended to be patient and her father tried to make her believe that he was feeling better and getting stronger but both father and daughter were aware of each others sorrow and heard the unvoiced sighs They were like two equal forces wearing each other away silently The fathers heart was melting because of his daughters plight They were two pure souls one departing and the other agonized with grief embracing in love and death and I was between the two with my own troubled heart We were three people gathered and crushed by the hands of destiny an old man like a dwelling ruined by flood a young woman whose symbol was a lily beheaded by the sharp edge of a sickle and a young man who was a weak sapling bent by a snowfall and all of us were toys in the hands of fate  Farris Effandi moved slowly and stretched his weak hand toward Selma and in a loving and tender voice said Hold my hand my beloved Selma held his hand then he said I have lived long enough and I have enjoyed the fruits of lifes seasons I have experienced all its phases with equanimity I lost your mother when you were three years of age and she left you as a precious treasure in my lap I watched you grow and your face reproduced your mothers features as stars reflected in a calm pool of water Your character intelligence and beauty are your mothers even your manner of speaking and gestures You have been my only consolation in this life because you were the image of your mother in every deed and word Now I grow old and my only resting place is between the soft wings of death Be comforted my beloved daughter because I have lived long enough to see you as a woman Be happy because I shall live in you after my death My departure today would be no different from my going tomorrow or the day after for our days are perishing like the leaves of autumn The hour of my days are perishing like the leaves of autumn The hour of my death approaches rapidly and my soul is desirous of being united with your mothers  As he uttered these words sweetly and lovingly his face was radiant Then he put his hand under his pillow and pulled out a small picture in a gold frame With his eyes on the little photograph he said Come Selma come and see your mother in this picture  Selma wiped away her tears and after gazing long at the picture she kissed it repeatedly and cried Oh my beloved mother Oh mother Then she placed her trembling lips on the picture as if she wished to pour her soul into that image  The most beautiful word on the lips of mankind is the word Mother and the most beautiful call is the call of My mother it is a word full of hope and love a sweet and kind word coming from the depths of the heart The mother is every thing  she is our consolation in sorrow our hope in misery and our strength in weakness She is the source of love mercy sympathy and forgiveness He who loses his mother loses a pure soul who blesses and guards him constantly  Every thing in nature bespeaks the mother The sun is the mother of earth and gives it its nourishment of hear it never leaves the universe at night until it has put the earth to sleep to the song of the sea and the hymn of birds and brooks And this earth is the mother of trees and flowers It produces them nurses them and weans them The trees and flowers become kind mothers of their great fruits and seeds And the mother the prototype of all existence is the eternal spirit full of beauty and love  Selma Karamy never knew her mother because she had died when Selma was an infant but Selma wept when she saw the picture and cried Oh mother The word mother is hidden in our hearts and it comes upon our lips in hours of sorrow and happiness as the perfume comes from the heart of the rose and mingles with clear and cloudy air  Selma stared at her mothers picture kissing it repeatedly until she collapsed by her fathers bed  The old man placed both hands on her head and said I have shown you my dear child a picture of your mother on paper Now listen to me and I shall let you hear her words  She lifted her head like a little bird in the nest that hears its mothers wing and looked at him attentively  Farris Effandi opened his mouth and said Your mother was nursing you when she lost her father she cried and wept at his going but she was wise and patient She sat by me in this room as soon as the funeral was over and held my hand and said Farris my father is dead now and you are my only consolation in this world The hearts affections are divided like the branches of the cedar tree if the tree loses one strong branch it will suffer but it does not die It will pour all its vitality into the next branch so that it will grow and fill the empty place This is what your mother told me when her father died and you should say the same thing when death takes my body to its resting place and my soul to Gods care  Selma answered him with falling tears and broken heart When Mother lost her father you took his place but who is going to take yours when you are gone She was left in the care of a loving and truthful husband she found consolation in her little daughter and who will be my consolation when you pass away You have been my father and mother and the companion of my youth  Saying these words she turned and looked at me and holding the side of my garment said This is the only friend I shall have after you are gone but how can he console me when he is suffering also How can a broken heart find consolation in a disappointed soul A sorrowful woman cannot be comforted by her neighbors sorrow nor can a bird fly with broken wings He is the friend of my soul but I have already placed a heavy burden of sorrow upon him and dimmed his eyes with my tears till he can see nothing but    7192020 Broken Wings by Kahlil Gibran  newthoughtlibrarycomgibranKhalilbrokenWings 1420  darkness He is a brother whom I dearly love but he is like all brothers who share my sorrow and help me shed tears which increase my bitterness and burn my heart  Selmas words stabbed my heart and I felt that I could bear no more The old man listened to her with depressed spirit The old man listened to her with depressed spirit trembling like the light of a lamp before the wind Then he stretched out his hand and said Let me go peacefully my child I have broken the bars of this cage let me fly and do not stop me for your mother is calling me The sky is clear and the sea is calm and the boat is ready to sail do not delay its voyage Let my body rest with those who are resting let my dream end and my soul awaken with the dawn let your soul embrace mine and give me the kiss of hope let no drops of sorrow or bitterness fall upon my body lest the flowers and grass refuse their nourishment Do not shed tears of misery upon my hand for they may grow thorns upon my grave Do not draw lines of agony upon my forehead for the wind may pass and read them and refuse to carry the dust of my bones to the green prairies I love you my child while I lived and I shall love you when I am dead and my soul shall always watch over you and protect you  Then Farris Effandi looked at me with his eyes half closed and said My son be a real brother to Selma as your father was to me Be her help and friend in need and do not let her mourn because mourning for the dead is a mistake Repeat to her pleasant tales and sing for her the songs of life so that she may forget her sorrows Remember me to your father ask him to tell you the stories of your youth and tell him that I loved him in the person of his son in the last hour of my life  Silence prevailed and I could see the pallor of death on the old mans face Then he rolled his eyes and looked at us and whispered Dont call the physician for he might extend my sentence in this prison by his medicine The days of slavery are gone and my soul seeks the freedom of the skies And do not call the priest to my bedside because his incantations would not save me if I were a sinner nor would it rush me to Heaven if I were innocent The will of humanity cannot change the will of God as an astrologer cannot change the course of the stars But after my death let the doctors and priest do what they please for my ship will continue sailing until it reaches its destination   At midnight Farris Effandi opened his tired eyes for the last time and focused them on Selma who was kneeling by his bedside He tried to speak but could not for death had already choked his voice but he finally managed to say The night has passed Oh SelmaOhOh Selma Then he bent his head his face turned white and I could see a smile on his lips as he breathed his last  Selma felt her fathers hand It was cold Then she raised her head and looked at his face It was covered with the veil of death Selma was so choked that she could not shed tears nor sigh nor even move For a moment she stared at him with fixed eyes like those of a statue then she bent down until her forehead touched the floor and said Oh Lord have mercy and mend our broken wings  Farris Effandi Karamy died his soul was embraced by Eternity and his body was returned to the earth Mansour Bey Galib got possession of his wealth and Selma became a prisoner of lifea life of grief and misery  I was lost in sorrow and reverie Days and nights preyed upon me as the eagle ravages its victim Many a time I tried to forget my misfortune by occupying myself with books and scriptures of past generation but it was like extinguishing fire with oil for I could see nothing in the procession of the past but tragedy and could hear nothing but weeping and wailing The Book of Job was more fascinating to me than the Psalms and I preferred the Elegies of Jeremiah to the Song of Solomon Hamlet was closer to my heart than all other dramas of western writers Thus despair weakens our sight and closes our ears We can see nothing but specters of doom and can hear only the beating of our agitated hearts     Return to the Top Return to the Top  Chapter 8  Between Christ and Ishtar  In the midst of the gardens and hills which connect the city of Beirut with Lebanon there is a small temple very ancient dug out of white rock surrounded by olive almond and willow trees Although this temple is a half mile from the main highway at the time of my story very few people interested in relics and ancient ruins had visited it It was one of many interesting places hidden and forgotten in Lebanon Due to its seclusion it had become a haven for worshippers and a shrine for lonely lovers  As one enters this temple he sees on the wall at the east side an old Phoenician picture carved in the rock depicting Ishtar goddess of love and beauty sitting on her throne surrounded by seven nude virgins standing in different posses The first one carries a torch the second a guitar the third a censer the fourth a jug of wine the fifth a branch of roses the sixth a wreath of laurel the seventh a bow and arrow and all of them look at Ishtar reverently  On the second wall there is another picture more modern than the first one symbolizing Christ nailed to the cross and at His side stand His sorrowful mother and Mary Magdalene and two other women weeping This Byzantine picture shows that it was carved in the fifteenth or sixteenth century  On the west side wall there are two round transits through which the suns rays enter the temple and strike the pictures and make them look as if they were painted with gold water color In the middle of the temple there is a square marble with old paintings on its    7192020 Broken Wings by Kahlil Gibran  newthoughtlibrarycomgibranKhalilbrokenWings 1520  sides some of which can hardly be seen under the petrified lumps of blood which show that the ancient people offered sacrifices on this rock and poured perfume wine and oil upon it  There is nothing else in that little temple except deep silence revealing to the living the secrets of the goddess and speaking worldlessly of past generations and the evolution of religions Such a sight carries the poet to a world far away from the one in which he dwells and convinces the philosopher that men were born religious they felt a need for that which they could not see and drew symbols the meaning of which divulged their hidden secrets and their desires in life and death   In that unknown temple I met Selma once every month and spent the hours with her looking at those strange pictures thinking of the crucified Christ and pondering upon the young Phoenician men and women who lived loved and worshipped beauty in the person of Ishtar by burning incense before her statue and pouring perfume on her shrine people for whom nothing is left to speak except the name repeated by the march of time before the face of Eternity  It is hard to write down in words the memories of those hours when I met Selma  those heavenly hours filled with pain happiness sorrow hope and misery  We met secretly in the old temple remembering the old days discussing our present fearing our future and gradually bringing out the hidden secrets in the depths of our hearts and complaining to each other of our misery and suffering trying to console ourselves with imaginary hopes and sorrowful dreams Every now and then we would become calm and wipe our tears and start smiling forgetting everything except Love we embraced each other until our hearts melted then Selma would print a pure kiss on my forehead and fill my heart with ecstasy I would return the kiss as she bent her ivory neck while her cheeks became gently red like the first ray of dawn on the forehead of hills We silently looked at the distant horizon where the clouds were colored with the orange ray of sunset  Our conversation was not limited to love every now and then we drifted on to current topics and exchanged ideas During the course of conversation Selma spoke of womans place in society the imprint that the past generation had left on her character the relationship between husband and wife and the spiritual diseases and corruption which threatened married life I remember her saying The poets and writers are trying to understand the reality of woman but up to this day they have not understood the hidden secrets of her heart because they look upon her from behind the sexual veil and see nothing but externals they look upon her through the magnifying glass of hatefulness and find nothing except weakness and submission  On another occasion she said pointing to the carved pictures on the walls of the temple In the heart of this rock there are two symbols depicting the essence of a womans desires and revealing the hidden secrets of her soul moving between love and sorrow  between affection and sacrifice between Ishtar sitting on the throne and Mary standing by the cross The man buys glory and reputation but the woman pays the price  No one knew about our secret meetings except God and the flock of birds which flew over the temple Selma used to come in her carriage to a place named Pasha park and from there she walked to the temple where she found me anxiously waiting for her  We feared not the observers eyes neither did our consciences bother us the spirit which is purified by fire and washed by tears is higher than what the people call shame and disgrace it is free from the laws of slavery and old customs against the affections of the human heart That spirit can proudly stand unashamed before the throne of God  Human society has yielded for seventy centuries to corrupted laws until it cannot understand the meaning of the superior and eternal laws A mans eyes have become accustomed to the dim light of candles and cannot see the sunlight Spiritual disease is inherited from one generation to another until it has become a part of people who look upon it not as a disease but as a natural gift showered by God upon Adam If those people found someone free from the germs of this disease they would think of him with shame and disgrace  Those who think evil of Selma Karamy because she left her husbands home and met me in the temple are the diseased and weak minded kind who look upon the healthy and sound as rebels They are like insects crawling in the dark for fear of being stepped upon by the passerby  The oppressed prisoner who can break away from his jail and does not do so is a coward Selma an innocent and oppressed prisoner was unable to free herself from slavery Was she to blame because she looked through the jail window upon the green fields and spacious sky Will the people count her as being untruthful to her husband because she came from his home to sit by me between Christ and Ishtar Let the people say what they please Selma had passed the marshes which submerge other spirits and had landed in a world that could not be reached by the howling of wolves and rattling of snakes People may say what they want about me for the spirit who has seen the specter of death cannot be scared by the faces of thieves the soldier who has seen the swords glittering over his head and streams of blood under his feet does not care about rocks thrown at him by the children on the streets  Return to the Top Return to the Top  Chapter 9  Sacrifice    7192020 Broken Wings by Kahlil Gibran  newthoughtlibrarycomgibranKhalilbrokenWings 1620  One day in the late part of June as the people left the city for the mountain to avoid the heat of summer I went as usual to the temple to meet Selma carrying with me a little book of Andalusian poems As I reached the temple I sat there waiting for Selma glancing at intervals at the pages of my book reciting those verses which filled my heart with ecstasy and brought to my soul the memory of the kings poets and knights who bade farewell to Granada and left with tears in their eyes and sorrow in their hearts their palaces institutions and hopes behind In an hour I saw Selma walking in the midst of the gardens and I approaching the temple leaning on her parasol as if she were carrying all the worries of the world upon her shoulders As she entered the temple and sat by me I noticed some sort of change in her eyes and I was anxious to inquire about it  Selma felt what was going on in my mind and she put her hand on my head and said Come close to me come my beloved come and let me quench my thirst for the hour of separation has come  I asked her Did your husband find out about our meeting her She responded My husband does not care about me neither does he know how I spend my time for he is busy with those poor girls whom poverty has driven into the houses of ill fame those girls who sell their bodies for bread kneaded with blood and tears  I inquired What prevents you from coming to this temple and sitting by me reverently before God Is your soul requesting our separation  She answered with tears in her eyes No my beloved my spirit did not ask for separation for you are a part of me My eyes never get tired of looking at you for you are their light but if destiny ruled that I should walk the rough path of life loaded with shackles would I be satisfied if your fate should be like mine Then she added I cannot say everything because the tongue is mute with pain and cannot talk the lips are sealed with misery and cannot move all I can say to you is that I am afraid you may fall in the same trap I fell in  When I asked What do you mean Selma and of whom are you afraid She covered her face with her hands and said The Bishop has already found out that once a month I have been leaving the grave which he buried me in  I inquired Did the Bishop find out about our meetings here She answered If he did you would not see me here sitting by you but he is getting suspicious and he informed all his servants and guards to watch me closely I am feeling that the house I live in and the path I walk on are all eyes watching me and fingers pointing at me and ears listening to the whisper of my thoughts  She was silent for a while and then she added with tears pouring down her cheeks I am not afraid of the Bishop for wetness does not scare the drowned but I am afraid you might fall into the trap and become his prey you are still young and free as the sunlight I am not frightened of fate which has shot all its arrows in my breast but I am afraid the serpent might bite your feet and detain you from climbing the mountain peak where the future awaits you with its pleasure and glory  I said He who has not been bitten by the serpents of light and snapped at by the wolves of darkness will always be deceived by the days and nights But listen Selma listen carefully is separation the only means of avoiding peoples evils and meanness Has the path of love and freedom been closed and is nothing left except submission to the will of the slaves of death  She responded Nothing is left save separation and bidding each other farewell  With rebellious spirit I took her hand and said excitedly We have yielded to the peoples will for a long time since the time we met until this hour we have been led by the blind and have worshipped with them before their idols Since the time I met you we have been in the hands of the Bishop like two balls which he has thrown around as he pleased Are we going to submit to his will until death takes us away Did God give us the breath of life to place it under deaths feet Did He give us liberty to make it a shadow of slavery He who extinguishes his spirits fire with his own hands is an infidel in the eyes of Heaven for Heaven set the fire that burns in our spirits He who does not rebel against oppression is doing himself injustice I love you Selma and you love me too and Love is a precious treasure it is Gods gift to sensitive and great spirits Shall we throw this treasure away and let the pigs scatter it and trample on it This world is full of wonder and beauty Why are we living in this narrow tunnel which the Bishop and his assistants have dug out for us Life is full of happiness and freedom why dont we take this heavy yoke off our shoulders and break the chains tied to our feet and walk freely toward peace Get up and let us leave this small temple for Gods great temple Let us leave this country and all its slavery and ignorance for another country far away and unreached by the hands of the thieves Let us go to the coast under the cover of night and catch a boat that will take us across the oceans where we can find a new life full of happiness and understanding Do not hesitate Selma for these minutes are more precious to us than the crowns of kings and more sublime than the thrones of angels Let us follow the column of light that leads us from this arid desert into the green fields where flowers and aromatic plants grow  She shook her head and gazed at something invisible on the ceiling of the temple a sorrowful smile appeared on her lips then she said No no my beloved Heaven placed in my hand a cup full of vinegar and gall I forced myself to drink it in order to know the full bitterness at the bottom until nothing was left save a few drops which I shall drink patiently I am not worthy of a new life of love and peace I am not strong enough for lifes pleasure and sweetness because a bird with broken wings cannot fly in the spacious sky The eyes that are accustomed to the dim light of a candle are not strong enough to stare at the sun Do not talk to me of happiness its memory makes me suffer Mention not peace to me its shadow frightens me but look at me and I will show you the holy torch which Heaven has lighted in the ashes of my heart  you know that I love you as a mother loves her only child and Love only taught me to protect you even from myself It is Love purified with fire that stops me from following you to the farthest land Love kills my desires so that you may live freely and virtuously Limited love asks for possession of the beloved but the unlimited asks only for itself Love that comes between the naivete and awakening of youth satisfies itself with possessing and grows with embraces But Love which is born in the firmaments lap and has descended with the nights secrets is not contended with anything but Eternity and immortality it does not stand reverently before anything except deity    7192020 Broken Wings by Kahlil Gibran  newthoughtlibrarycomgibranKhalilbrokenWings 1720  When I knew that the Bishop wanted to stop me from leaving his nephews house and to take my only pleasure away from me I stood before the window of my room and looked toward the sea thinking of the vast countries beyond it and the real freedom and personal independence which can be found there I felt that I was living close to you surrounded by the shadow of your spirit submerged in the ocean of your affection But all these thoughts which illuminate a womans heart and make her rebel against old customs and live in the shadow of freedom and justice made me believe that I am weak and that our love is limited and feeble unable to stand before the suns face I cried like a king whose kingdom and treasure have been usurped but immediately I saw your face through my tears and your eyes gazing at me and I remembered what you said to me once Come Selma come and let us be strong towers before the tempest Let us stand like brave soldiers before the enemy and face his weapons If we are killed we shall die as martyrs and if we win we shall live as heroes Braving obstacles and hardships is nobler than retreat to tranquility These words my beloved you uttered when the wings of death were hovering around my fathers bed I remembered them yesterday when the wings of despair were hovering above my head I strengthened myself and felt while in the darkness of my prison some sort of precious freedom easing our difficulties and diminishing our sorrows I found out that our love was as deep as the ocean and as high as the stars and as spacious as the sky I came here to see you and in my weak spirit there is a new strength and this strength is the ability to sacrifice a great thing in order to obtain a greater one it is the sacrifice of my happiness so that you may remain virtuous and honorable in the eyes of the people and be far away from their treachery and persecution  In the past when I came to this place I felt as if heavy chains were pulling down on me but today I came here with a new determination that laughs at the shackles and shortens the way I used to come to this temple like a scared phantom but today I came like a brave woman who feels the urgency of sacrifice and knows the value of suffering a woman who likes to protect the one she loves from the ignorant people and from her hungry spirit I used to sit by you like a trembling shadow but today I came here to show you my true self before Ishtar and Christ  I am a tree grown in the shade and today I stretched my branches to tremble for a while in the daylight I came here to tell you goodbye my beloved and it is my hope that our farewell will be great and awful like our love Let our farewell be like fire that bends the gold and makes it more resplendent  Selma did not allow me to speak or protest but she looked at me her eyes glittering her face retaining its dignity seeming like an angel worthy of silence and respect Then she flung herself upon me something which she had never done before and put her smooth arms around me and printed a long deep fiery kiss on my lips  As the sun went down withdrawing its rays from those gardens and orchards Selma moved to the middle of the temple and gazed along at its walls and corners as if she wanted to pour the light of her eyes on its pictures and symbols Then she walked forward and reverently knelt before the picture of Christ and kissed His feet and she whispered Oh Christ I have chosen Thy Cross and deserted Ishtars world of pleasure and happiness I have worn the wreath of thorns and discarded the wreath of laurel and washed myself with blood and tears instead of perfume and scent I have drunk vinegar and gall from a cup which was meant for wine and nectar accept me my Lord among Thy followers and lead me toward Galilee with those who have chosen Thee contended with their sufferings and delighted with their sorrows  Then she rose and looked at me and said Now I shall return happily to my dark cave where horrible ghosts reside Do not sympathize with me my beloved and do not feel sorry for me because the soul that sees the shadow of God once will never be frightened thereafter of the ghosts of devils And the eye that looks on heaven once will not be closed by the pains of the world  Uttering these words Selma left the place of worship and I remained there lost in a deep sea of thoughts absorbed in the world of revelation where God sits on the throne and the angels write down the acts of human beings and the souls recite the tragedy of life and the brides of Heaven sing the hymns of love sorrow and immortality  Light had already come when I awakened from my swoon and found myself bewildered in the midst of the gardens repeating the echo of every word uttered by Selma and remembering her silence her actions her movements her expression and the touch of her hands until I realized the meaning of farewell and the pain of lonesomeness I was depressed and heartbroken It was my first discovery of the fact that men even if they are born free will remain slaves of strict laws enacted by their forefathers and that the firmament which we imagine as unchanging is the yielding of today to the will of tomorrow and submission of yesterday to the will of today  Many a time since the night I have thought of the spiritual law which made Selma prefer death to life and many a time I have made a comparison between nobility of sacrifice and happiness of rebellion to find out which one is nobler and more beautiful but until now I have distilled only one truth out of the whole matter and this truth is sincerity which makes all our deeds beautiful and honorable And this sincerity was in Selma Karamy  Return to the Top Return to the Top  Chapter 10  The Rescuer  Five years of Selmas marriage passed without bringing children to strengthen the ties of spiritual relation between her and her husband and bind their repugnant souls together  A barren woman is looked upon with disdain everywhere because of most mens desire to perpetuate themselves through posterity    7192020 Broken Wings by Kahlil Gibran  newthoughtlibrarycomgibranKhalilbrokenWings 1820  The substantial man considers his childless wife as an enemy he detests her and deserts her and wishes her death Mansour Bey Galib was that kind of man materially he was like earth and hard like steel and greedy like a grave His desire of having a child to carry on his name and reputation made him hate Selma in spite of her beauty and sweetness  A tree grown in a cave does not bear fruit and Selma who lived in the shade of life did not bear children  The nightingale does not make his nest in a cage lest slavery be the lot of its chicks Selma was a prisoner of misery and it was Heavens will that she would not have another prisoner to share her life The flowers of the field are the children of suns affection and natures love and the children of men are the flowers of love and compassion  The spirit of love and compassion never dominated Selmas beautiful home at Ras Beyrouth nevertheless she knelt down on her knees every night before Heaven and asked God for a child in whom she would find comfort and consolation She prayed successively until Heaven answered her prayers  The tree of the cave blossomed to bear fruit at last The nightingale in the cage commenced making its nest with the feathers of its wings  Selma stretched her chained arms toward Heaven to receive Gods precious gift and nothing in the world could have made her happier than becoming a potential mother  She waited anxiously counting the days and looking forward to the time when Heavens sweetest melody the voice of her child should ring in her ears  She commenced to see the dawn of a brighter future through her tears  It was the month of Nisan when Selma was stretched on the bed of pain and labor where life and death were wrestling The doctor and the midwife were ready to deliver to the world a new guest Late at night Selma started her successive cry a cry of lifes partition from life a cry of continuance in the firmament of nothingness a cry of a weak force before the stillness of great forces the cry of poor Selma who was lying down in despair under the feet of life and death  At dawn Selma gave birth to a baby boy When she opened her eyes she saw smiling faces all over the room then she looked again and saw life and death still wrestling by her bed She closed her eyes and cried saying for the first time Oh my son The midwife wrapped the infant with silk swaddles and placed him by his mother but the doctor kept looking at Selma and sorrowfully shaking his head  The voices of joy woke the neighbors who rushed into the house to felicitate the father upon the birth of his heir but the doctor still gazed at Selma and her infant and shook his head  The servants hurried to spread the good news to Mansour Bey but the doctor stared at Selma and her child with a disappointed look on his face  As the sun came out Selma took the infant to her breast he opened his eyes for the first time and looked at his mother then he quivered and closed them for the last time The doctor took the child from Selmas arms and on his cheeks fell tears then he whispered to himself He is a departing guest  The child passed away while the neighbors were celebrating with the father in the big hall at the house and drinking to the health of their heir and Selma looked at the doctor and pleaded Give me my child and let me embrace him  Though the child was dead the sounds of the drinking cups increased in the hall  He was born at dawn and died at sunrise  He was born like a thought and died like a sigh and disappeared like a shadow  He did not live to console and comfort his mother  His life began at the end of the night and ended at the beginning of the day like a drop of few poured by the eyes of the dark and dried by the touch of the light  A pearl brought by the tide to the coast and returned by the ebb into the depth of the sea  A lily that has just blossomed from the bud of life and is mashed under the feet of death  A dear guest whose appearance illuminated Selmas heart and whose departure killed her soul  This is the life of men the life of nations the life of suns moons and stars  And Selma focused her eyes upon the doctor and cried Give me my child and let me embrace him give me my child and let me nurse him  Then the doctor bent his head His voice choked and he said Your child is dead Madame be patient    7192020 Broken Wings by Kahlil Gibran  newthoughtlibrarycomgibranKhalilbrokenWings 1920  Upon hearing her doctors announcement Selma uttered a terrible cry Then she was quiet for a moment and smiled happily Her face brightened as if she had discovered something and quietly she said Give me my child bring him close to me and let me see him dead  The doctor carried the dead child to Selma and placed him between her arms She embraced him then turned her face toward the wall and addressed the dead infant saying You have come to take me away my child you have come to show me the way that leads to the coast Here I am my child lead me and let us leave this dark cave  And in a minute the suns ray penetrated the window curtains and fell upon two calm bodies lying on a bed guarded by the profound dignity of silence and shaded by the wings of death The doctor left the room with tears in his eyes and as he reached the big hall the celebrations was converted into a funeral but Mansour Bey Galib never uttered a word or shed a tear He remained standing motionless like a statue holding a drinking cup with his right hand  The second day Selma was shrouded with her white wedding dress and laid in a coffin the childs shroud was his swaddle his coffin was his mothers arms his grave was her calm breast Two corpses were carried in one coffin and I walked reverently with the crowd accompanying Selma and her infant to their resting place  Arriving at the cemetery Bishop Galib commenced chanting while the other priests prayed and on their gloomy faces appeared a veil of ignorance and emptiness  As the coffin went down one of the bystanders whispered This is the first time in my life I have seen two corpses in one coffin Another one said It seems as if the child had come to rescue his mother from her pitiless husband  A third one said Look at Mansour Bey he is gazing at the sky as if his eyes were made of glass He does not look like he has lost his wife and child in one day A fourth one added His uncle the Bishop will marry him again tomorrow to a wealthier and stronger woman  The Bishop and the priests kept on singing and chanting until the gravedigger was through filing the ditch Then the people individually approached the Bishop and his nephew and offered their respects to them with sweet words of sympathy but I stood lonely aside without a soul to console me as if Selma and her child meant nothing to me  The farewellbidders left the cemetery the gravedigger stood by the new grave holding a shovel with his hand  As I approached him I inquired Do you remember where Farris Effandi Karamy was buried  He looked at me for a moment then pointed at Selmas grave and said Right here I placed his daughter upon him and upon his daughters breast rests her child and upon all I put the earth back with this shovel  Then I said In this ditch you have also buried my heart  As the gravedigger disappeared behind the poplar trees I could not resist anymore I dropped down on Selmas grave and wept  Return to the Top Return to the Top  INDEX OF SCRIPTURAL REFERENCES  AND

 PART V Conclusion    Conclusion    INDEX   Part I Introduction  INTRODUCTION   For many years now historians have preferred to turn their attention to long periods as if beneath the shifts  and changes of political events they were trying to reveal the stable almost indestructible system of checks  and balances the irreversible processes the constant readjustments the underlying tendencies that gather  force and are then suddenly reversed after centuries of continuity the movements of accumulation and slow  saturation the great silent motionless bases that traditional history has covered with a thick layer of events  The tools that enable historians to carry out this work of analysis are partly inherited and partly of their own  making models of economic growth quantitative analysis of market movements accounts of demographic  expansion and contraction the study of climate and its longterm changes the fixing of sociological constants  the description of technological adjustments and of their spread and continuity These tools have enabled  workers in the historical field to distinguish various sedimentary strata linear successions which for so long  had been the object of research have given way to discoveries in depth From the political mobility at the  surface down to the slow movements of material civilization ever more levels of analysis have been  established each has its own peculiar discontinuities and patterns and as one descends to the deepest levels  the rhythms become broader Beneath the rapidly   4     changing history of governments wars and famines there emerge other apparently unmoving histories the history of  sea routes the history of corn or of goldmining the history of drought and of irrigation the history of crop rotation the  history of the balance achieved by the human species between hunger and abundance The old questions of the  traditional analysis What link should be made between disparate events How can a causal succession be established  between them What continuity or overall significance do they possess Is it possible to define a totality or must one be  content with reconstituting connexions are now being replaced by questions of another type which strata should be  isolated from others What types of series should be established What criteria of periodization should be adopted for  each of them What system of relations hierarchy dominance stratification univocal determination circular causality  may be established between them What series of series may be established And in what largescale chronological table  may distinct series of events be determined   At about the same time in the disciplines that we call the history of ideas the history of science the history of  philosophy the history of thought and the history of literature we can ignore their specificity for the moment in those  disciplines which despite their names evade very largely the work and methods of the historian attention has been  turned on the contrary away from vast unities like periods or centuries to the phenomena of rupture of discontinuity  Beneath the great continuities of thought beneath the solid homogeneous manifestations of a single mind or of a  collective mentality beneath the stubborn development of a science striving to exist and to reach completion at the very  outset beneath the persistence of a particular genre form discipline or theoretical activity one is now trying to detect  the incidence of interruptions Interruptions whose status and nature vary considerably There are the epistemological  acts and thresholds described by Bachelard they suspend the continuous accumulation of knowledge interrupt its slow  development and force it to enter a new time cut it off from its empirical origin and its original motivations cleanse it  of its imaginary complicities they direct historical analysis away from the search for silent beginnings and the never ending tracingback to the original precursors towards the search for a new type of rationality   5  and its various effects There are the displacements and transformations of concepts the analyses of G Canguilhem may  serve as models they show that the history of a concept is not wholly and entirely that of its progressive refinement its  continuously increasing rationality its abstraction gradient but that of its various fields of constitution and validity that  of its successive rules of use that of the many theoretical contexts in which it developed and matured There is the  distinction which we also owe to Canguilhem between the microscopic and macroscopic scales of the history of the  sciences in which events and their consequences are not arranged in the same way thus a discovery the development of  a method the achievements and the failures of a particular scientist do not have the same incidence and cannot be  described in the same way at both levels on each of the two levels a different history is being written Recurrent  redistributions reveal several pasts several forms of connexion several hierarchies of importance several networks of  determination several teleologies for one and the same science as its present undergoes change thus historical descrip tions are necessarily ordered by the present state of knowledge they increase with every transformation and never cease  in turn to break with themselves in the field of mathematics M Serres has provided the theory of this phenomenon  There are the architectonic unities of systems of the kind analysed by M Gueroult which are concerned not with the  description of cultural influences traditions and continuities but with internal coherences axioms deductive  connexions compatibilities Lastly the most radical discontinuities are the breaks effected by a work of theoretical  transformation which establishes a science by detaching it from the ideology of its past and by revealing this past as  ideological To this should be added of course literary analysis which now takes as its unity not the spirit or sensibility  of a period nor groups schools generations or movements nor even the personality of the author in the interplay of  his life and his creation but the particular structure of a given auvre book or text   And the great problem presented by such historical analyses is not how continuities are established how a single  pattern is formed and preserved how for so many different successive minds there is a single        footnote   L Althusser For Marx London Allen Lane New York Pantheon 1969 p 168       6  horizon what mode of action and what substructure is implied by the interplay of transmissions resumptions  disappearances and repetitions how the origin may extend its sway well beyond itself to that conclusion that is never  given  the problem is no longer one of tradition of tracing a line but one of division of limits it is no longer one of  lasting foundations but one of transformations that serve as new foundations the rebuilding of foundations What one is     seeing then is the emergence of a whole field of questions some of which are already familiar by which this new form  of history is trying to develop its own theory how is one to specify the different concepts that enable us to conceive of  discontinuity threshold rupture break mutation transformation  By what criteria is one to isolate the unities with  which one is dealing what is a science What is an oeuvre What is a theory What is a concept What is a text How is  one to diversify the levels at which one may place oneself each of which possesses its own divisions and form of  analysis What is the legitimate level of formalization What is that of interpretation Of structural analysis Of  attributions of causality   In short the history of thought of knowledge of philosophy of literature seems to be seeking and discovering more  and more discontinuities whereas history itself appears to be abandoning the irruption of events in favour of stable  structures    But we must not be taken in by this apparent interchange Despite appearances we must not imagine that certain of the  historical disciplines have moved from the continuous to the discontinuous while others have moved from the tangled  mass of discontinuities to the great uninterrupted unities we must not imagine that in the analysis of politics  institutions or economics we have become more and more sensitive to overall determinations while in the analysis of  ideas and of knowledge we are paying more and more attention to the play of difference we must not imagine that these  two great forms of description have crossed without recognizing one another   In fact the same problems are being posed in either case but they have provoked opposite effects on the surface  These problems may be summed up in a word the questioning of the document Of course it is obvious enough that  ever since a discipline such as history has existed   7  documents have been used questioned and have given rise to questions scholars have asked not only what these  documents meant but also whether they were telling the truth and by what right they could claim to be doing so  whether they were sincere or deliberately misleading well informed or ignorant authentic or tampered with But each of  these questions and all this critical concern pointed to one and the same end the reconstitution on the basis of what the  documents say and sometimes merely hint at of the past from which they emanate and which has now disappeared far  behind them the document was always treated as the language of a voice since reduced to silence its fragile but  possibly decipherable trace Now through a mutation that is not of very recent origin but which has still not come to an  end history has altered its position in relation to the document it has taken as its primary task not the interpretation of  the document nor the attempt to decide whether it is telling the truth or what is its expressive value but to work on it  from within and to develop it history now organizes the document divides it up distributes it orders it arranges it in  levels establishes series distinguishes between what is relevant and what is not discovers elements defines unities  describes relations The document then is no longer for history an inert material through which it tries to reconstitute  what men have done or said the events of which only the trace remains history is now trying to define within the  documentary material itself unities totalities series relations History must be detached from the image that satisfied it  for so long and through which it found its anthropological justification that of an ageold collective consciousness that  made use of material documents to refresh its memory history is the work expended on material documentation books  texts accounts registers acts buildings institutions laws techniques objects customs etc that exists in every time  and place in every society either in a spontaneous or in a consciously organized form The document is not the  fortunate tool of a history that is primarily and fundamentally memory history is one way in which a society recognizes  and develops a mass of documentation with which it is inextricably linked   To be brief then let us say that history in its traditional form undertook to memorize the monuments of the past  transform them into documents and lend speech to those traces which in themselves are        8  often not verbal or which say in silence something other than what they actually say in our time history is that which  transforms documents into monuments In that area where in the past history deciphered the traces left by men it now  deploys a mass of elements that have to be grouped made relevant placed in relation to one another to form totalities  There was a time when archaeology as a discipline devoted to silent monuments inert traces objects without context  and things left by the past aspired to the condition of history and attained meaning only through the restitution of a  historical discourse it might be said to play on words a little that in our time history aspires to the condition of  archaeology to the intrinsic description of the monument   This has several consequences First of all there is the surface effect already mentioned the proliferation of  discontinuities in the history of ideas and the emergence of long periods in history proper In fact in its traditional form  history proper was concerned to define relations of simple causality of circular determination of antagonism of  expression between facts or dated events the series being known it was simply a question of defining the position of  each element in relation to the other elements in the series The problem now is to constitute series to define the elements  proper to each series to fix its boundaries to reveal its own specific type of relations to formulate its laws   and beyond this to describe the relations between different series thus constituting series of series or tables hence the  everincreasing number of strata and the need to distinguish them the specificity of their time and chronologies hence  the need to distinguish not only important events with a long chain of consequences and less important ones but types     of events at quite different levels some very brief others of average duration like the development of a particular  technique or a scarcity of money and others of a longterm nature like a demographic equilibrium or the gradual  adjustment of an economy to climatic change hence the possibility of revealing series with widely spaced intervals  formed by rare or repetitive events The appearance of long periods in the history of today is not a return to the  philosophers of history to the great ages of the world or to the periodization dictated by the rise and fall of civilizations  it is the effect of the methodologically concerted development       9     of series In the history of ideas of thought and of the sciences the same mutation has brought about the opposite effect  it has broken up the long series formed by the progress of consciousness or the teleology of reason or the evolution of  human thought it has questioned the themes of convergence and culmination it has doubted the possibility of creating  totalities It has led to the individualization of different series which are juxtaposed to one another follow one another  overlap and intersect without one being able to reduce them to a liner schema Thus in place of the continuous  chronology of reason which was invariably traced back to some inaccessible origin there have appeared scales that are  sometimes very brief distinct from one another irreducible to a single law scales that bear a type of history peculiar to  each one and which cannot be reduced to the general model of a consciousness that acquires progresses and  remembers   Second consequence the notion of discontinuity assumes a major role in the historical disciplines For history in its  classical form the discontinuous was both the given and the unthinkable the raw material of history which presented  itself in the form of dispersed events  decisions accidents initiatives discoveries the material which through  analysis had to be rearranged reduced effaced in order to reveal the continuity of events Discontinuity was the stigma  of temporal dislocation that it was the historians task to remove from history It has now become one of the basic  elements of historical analysis Its role is threefold First it constitutes a deliberate operation on the part of the historian  and not a quality of the material with which he has to deal for the must at least as a systematic hypothesis distinguish  the possible levels of analysis the methods proper to each and the periodization that best suits them Secondly it is the  result of his description and not something that must be eliminated by means of his analysis  for he is trying to  discover the limits of a process the point of inflexion of a curve the inversion of a regulatory movement the boundaries  of an oscillation the threshold of a function the instant at which a circular causality breaks down Thirdly it is the  concept that the historians work never ceases to specify instead of neglecting it as a uniform indifferent blank between  two positive figures  it assumes a specific form and function according to the field and the level to which it is assigned  one does not speak of the same discontinuity when   10  describing an epistemological threshold the point of reflexion in a population curve or the replacement of one technique  by another The notion of discontinuity is a paradoxical one because it is both an instrument and an object of research  because it divides up the field of which it is the effect because it enables the historian to individualize different domains  but can be established only by comparing those domains And because in the final analysis perhaps it is not simply a  concept present in the discourse of the historian but something that the historian secretly supposes to be present on  what basis in fact could he speak without this discontinuity that offers him history  and his own history  as an  object One of the most essential features of the new history is probably this displacement of the discontinuous its  transference from the obstacle to the work itself its integration into the discourse of the historian where it no longer  plays the role of an external condition that must be reduced but that of a working concept and therefore the inversion of  signs by which it is no longer the negative of the historical reading its underside its failure the limit of its power but  the positive element that determines its object and validates its analysis   Third consequence the theme and the possibility of a total history begin to disappear and we see the emergence of  something very different that might be called a general history The project of a total history is one that seeks to  reconstitute the overall form of a civilization the principle  material or spiritual  of a society the significance com mon to all the phenomena of a period the law that accounts for their cohesion  what is called metaphorically the face  of a period Such a project is linked to two or three hypotheses it is supposed that between all the events of a well defined spatiotemporal area between all the phenomena of which traces have been found it must be possible to  establish a system of homogeneous relations a network of causality that makes it possible to derive each of them  relations of analogy that show how they symbolize one another or how they all express one and the same central core it  is also supposed that one and the same form of historicity operates upon economic structures social institutions and  customs the inertia of mental attitudes technological practice political behaviour and subjects them all to the same  type of transformation lastly it is supposed that history itself may be articulated into          11  great units  stages or phases  which contain within themselves their own principle of cohesion These are the  postulates that are challenged by the new history when it speaks of series divisions limits differences of level shifts  chronological specificities particular forms of rehandling possible types of relation This is not because it is trying to  obtain a plurality of histories juxtaposed and independent of one another that of the economy beside that of institutions  and beside these two those of science religion or literature nor is it because it is merely trying to discover between  these different histories coincidences of dates or analogies of form and meaning The problem that now presents itself   and which defines the task of a general history  is to determine what form of relation may be legitimately described  between these different series what vertical system they are capable of forming what interplay of correlation and  dominance exists between them what may be the effect of shifts different temporalities and various rehandlings in  what distinct totalities certain elements may figure simultaneously in short not only what series but also what series of  series  or in other words what tables it is possible to draw up A total description draws all phenomena around a  single centre  a principle a meaning a spirit a worldview an overall shape a general history on the contrary would  deploy the space of a dispersion   Fourth and last consequence the new history is confronted by a number of methodological problems several of  which no doubt existed long before the emergence of the new history but which taken together characterize it These  include the buildingup of coherent and homogeneous corpora of documents open or closed exhausted or inexhaustible  corpora the establishment of a principle of choice according to whether one wishes to treat the documentation exhaust ively or adopt a sampling method as in statistics or try to determine in advance which are the most representative  elements  the definition of the level of analysis and of the relevant elements in the material studied one may extract  numerical indications references  explicit or not  to events institutions practices the words used with their  grammatical rules and the semantic fields that they indicate or again the formal structure of the propositions and the  types of connexion that unite them the specification of a method of analysis the quantitative treatment of data the  breakingdown of the material according to a        12  number of assignable features whose correlations are then studied interpretative decipherment analysis of frequency and  distribution the delimitation of groups and subgroups that articulate the material regions periods unitary processes   the determination of relations that make it possible to characterize a group these may be numerical or logical relations  functional causal or analogical relations or it may be the relation of the signifier signifiant to the signified signifie   All these problems are now part of the methodological field of history This field deserves attention and for two  reasons First because one can see to what extent it has freed itself from what constituted not so long ago the philosophy  of history and from the questions that it posed on the rationality or teleology of historical development devenir on the  relativity of historical knowledge and on the possibility of discovering or constituting a meaning in the inertia of the past  and in the unfinished totality of the present Secondly because it intersects at certain points problems that are met with in  other fields  in linguistics ethnology economics literary analysis and mythology for example These problems may  if one so wishes be labelled structuralism But only under certain conditions they do not of themselves cover the entire  methodological field of history they occupy only one part of that field  a part that varies in importance with the area  and level of analysis apart from a number of relatively limited cases they have not been imported from linguistics or  ethnology as is often the case today but they originated in the field of history itself  more particularly in that of  economic history and as a result of the questions posed by that discipline lastly in no way do they authorize us to speak  of a structuralism of history or at least of an attempt to overcome a conflict or opposition between structure and  historical development it is a long time now since historians uncovered described and analysed structures without ever  having occasion to wonder whether they were not allowing the living fragile pulsating history to slip through their  fingers The structuredevelopment opposition is relevant neither to the definition of the historical field nor in all  probability to the definition of a structural method   This epistemological mutation of history is not yet complete But it is  not of recent origin either since its first phase can no doubt be traced         13   back to Marx But it took a long time to have much effect Even now  and this is especially true in the case of the  history of thought  it has been neither registered nor reflected upon while other more recent transformations  those  of linguistics for example  have been It is as if it was particularly difficult in the history in which men retrace their  own ideas and their own knowledge to formulate a general theory of discontinuity of series of limits unities specific  orders and differentiated autonomies and dependences As if in that field where we had become used to seeking origins     to pushing back further and further the line of antecedents to reconstituting traditions to following evolutive curves to  projecting teleologies and to having constant recourse to metaphors of life we felt a particular repugnance to conceiving  of difference to describing separations and dispersions to dissociating the reassuring form of the identical Or to be  more precise as if we found it difficult to construct a theory to draw general conclusions and even to derive all the  possible implications of these concepts of thresholds mutations independent systems and limited series  in the way in  which they had been used in fact by historians As if we were afraid to conceive of the Other in the time of our own  thought   There is a reason for this If the history of thought could remain the locus of uninterrupted continuities if it could  endlessly forge connexions that no analysis could undo without abstraction if it could weave around everything that men  say and do obscure synthesis that anticipate for him prepare him and lead him endlessly towards his future it would  provide a privileged shelter for the sovereignty of consciousness Continuous history is the indispensable correlative of  the founding function of the subject the guarantee that everything that has eluded him may be restored to him the  certainty that time will disperse nothing without restoring it in a reconstituted unity the promise that one day the subject   in the form of historical consciousness  will once again be able to appropriate to bring back under his sway all  those things that are kept at a distance by difference and find in them what might be called his abode Making historical  analysis the discourse of the continuous and making human consciousness the original subject of all historical  development and all action are the two sides of the same system of thought In this system time is conceived  in terms of totalization and revolutions are never more than moments of consciousness    14     In various forms this theme has played a constant role since the nineteenth century to preserve against all  decentrings the sovereignty of the subject and the twin figures of anthropology and humanism Against the decentring  operated by Marx  by the historical analysis of the relations of production economic determinations and the class  struggle  it gave place towards the end of the nineteenth century to the search for a total history in which all the  differences of a society might be reduced to a single form to the organization of a worldview to the establishment of a  system of values to a coherent type of civilization To the decentring operated by the Nietzschean genealogy it opposed  the search for an original foundation that would make rationality the telos of mankind and link the whole history of  thought to the preservation of this rationality to the maintenance of this teleology and to the ever necessary return to this  foundation Lastly more recently when the researches of psychoanalysis linguistics and ethnology have decentred the  subject in relation to the laws of his desire the forms of his language the rules of his action or the games of his mythical  or fabulous discourse when it became clear that man himself questioned as to what he was could not account for his  sexuality and his unconscious the systematic forms of his language or the regularities of his fictions the theme of a  continuity of history has been reactivated once again a history that would be not division but development devenir not  an interplay of relations but an internal dynamic not a system but the hard work of freedom not form but the unceasing  effort of a consciousness turned upon itself trying to grasp itself in its deepest conditions a history that would be both an  act of long uninterrupted patience and the vivacity of a movement which in the end breaks all bounds If one is to assert  this theme which to the immobility of structures to their closed system to their necessary synchrony opposes the  living openness of history one must obviously deny in the historical analyses themselves the use of discontinuity the  definition of levels and limits the description of specific series the uncovering of the whole interplay of differences One  is led therefore to anthropologize Marx to make of him a historian of totalities and to rediscover in him the message of  humanism one is led therefore   15  to interpret Nietzsche in the terms of transcendental philosophy and to reduce his genealogy to the level of a search for  origins lastly one is led to leave to one side as if it had never arisen that whole field of methodological problems that  the new history is now presenting For if it is asserted that the question of discontinuities systems and transformations  series and thresholds arises in all the historical disciplines and in those concerned with ideas or the sciences no less than  those concerned with economics and society how could one oppose with any semblance of legitimacy development and  system movement and circular regulations or as it is sometimes put crudely and unthinkingly history and structure   The same conservative function is at work in the theme of cultural totalities for which Marx has been criticized then  travestied in the theme of a search for origins which was opposed to Nietzsche before an attempt was made to  transpose him into it and in the theme of a living continuous open history The cry goes up that one is murdering  history whenever in a historical analysis  and especially if it is concerned with thought ideas or knowledge  one is  seen to be using in too obvious a way the categories of discontinuity and difference the notions of threshold rupture and     transformation the description of series and limits One will be denounced for attacking the inalienable rights of history  and the very foundations of any possible historicity But one must not be deceived what is being bewailed with such  vehemence is not the disappearance of history but the eclipse of that form of history that was secretly but entirely related  to the synthetic activity of the subject what is being bewailed is the development devenir that was to provide the  sovereignty of the consciousness with a safer less exposed shelter than myths kinship systems languages sexuality or  desire what is being bewailed is the possibility of reanimating through the project the work of meaning or the move ment of totalization the interplay of material determinations rules of practice unconscious systems rigorous but  unreflected relations correlations that elude all lived experience what is being bewailed is that ideological use of history  by which one tries to restore to man everything that has unceasingly eluded him for over a hundred years All the  treasure of bygone days was crammed into the old citadel of this history it was thought to be secure it was sacralized it  was made the last   16  restingplace of anthropological thought it was even thought that its most inveterate enemies could be captured and  turned into vigilant guardians But the historians had long ago deserted the old fortress and gone to work elsewhere it  was realized that neither Marx nor Nietzsche were carrying out the guard duties that had been entrusted to them They  could not be depended on to preserve privilege nor to affirm once and for all  and God knows it is needed in the  distress of today  that history at least is living and continuous that it is for the subject in question a place of rest  certainty reconciliation a place of tranquillized sleep   At this point there emerges an enterprise of which my earlier hooks Histoire de la folie Madness and Civilization  Naissance de la clinique and Les Mots et les choses The Order of Things were a very imperfect sketch An enterprise  by which one tries to measure the mutations that operate in general in the field of history an enterprise in which the  methods limits and themes proper to the history of ideas are questioned an enterprise by which one tries to throw off  the last anthropological constraints an enterprise that wishes in return to reveal how these constraints could come  about These tasks were outlined in a rather disordered way and their general articulation was never clearly defined It  was time that they were given greater coherence  or at least that an attempt was made to do so This book is the  result   In order to avoid misunderstanding I should like to begin with a few observations   My aim is not to transfer to the field of history and more particularly to the history of knowledge  connaissances3 a structuralist      footnote     Madness and Civilization New York Random House 1965 London Tavistock 1967 The Order of Things London Tavistock New York Pantheon 1970 A  translation of Naissance de la clinique was published in 1973 TavistockPantheon   The English knowledge translates the French connaissance and savoir Connaissance refers here to a particular corpus of knowledge a particular discipline   biology or economics for example Savoir which is usually defined as knowledge in general the totality of connaissnnces is used by Foucault in an  underlying rather than an overall way He has himself offered the following comment on his usage of the terms   By connaissance I mean the relation of the subject to the object and the formal rules that govern it Savoir refers to the conditions that are necessary in a  particular period for this   17  method that has proved valuable in other fields of analysis My aim is to uncover the principles and consequences of an  autochthonous transformation that is taking place in the field of historical knowledge It may well be that this  transformation the problems that it raises the tools that it uses the concepts that emerge from it and the results that it  obtains are not entirely foreign to what is called structural analysis But this kind of analysis is not specifically used    my aim is most decidedly not to use the categories of cultural totalities whether worldviews ideal types the  particular spirit of an age in order to impose on history despite itself the forms of structural analysis The series  described the limits fixed the comparisons and correlations made are based not on the old philosophies of history but  are intended to question teleologien and totalizations    in so far as my aim is to define a method of historical analysis freed from the anthropological theme it is clear that the  theory that I am about to outline has a dual relation with the previous studies It is an attempt to formulate in general  terms and not without a great deal of rectification and elaboration the tools that these studies have used or forged for  themselves in the course of their work But on the other hand it uses the results already obtained to define a method of     analysis purged of all anthropologism The ground on which it rests is the one that it has itself discovered The studies of  madness and the beginnings of psychology of illness and the beginnings of a clinical medicine of the sciences of life  language and economics were attempts that were carried out to some extent in the dark but they gradually became  clear not only because little by little their method became more precise but also because they discovered  in this  debate on humanism and anthropology  the point of its historical possibility     In short this book like those that preceded it does not belong  at least directly or in the first instance  to the  debate on structure as     footnote   or that type of object to he given to connaissance and for this or that enunciation to he formulated  Throughout this translation I have used the English word followed where the meaning required it by the appropriate French word in parentheses Tr   18  opposed to genesis history development it belongs to that field in which the questions of the  human being consciousness origin and the subject emerge intersect mingle and separate off But  it would probably not be incorrect to say that the problem of structure arose there too   This work is not an exact description of what can be read in Madness and Civilization Naissance  de la clinique or The Order of Things It is different on a great many points It also includes a  number of corrections and internal criticisms Generally speaking Madness and Civilization  accorded far too great a place and a very enigmatic one too to what I called an experiment thus  showing to what extent one was still close to admitting an anonymous and general subject of history  in Naissance de la clinique the frequent recourse to structural analysis threatened to bypass the  specificity of the problem presented and the level proper to archaeology lastly in The Order of  Things the absence of methodological signposting may have given the impression that my analyses  were being conducted in terms of cultural totality It is mortifying that I was unable to avoid these  dangers I console myself with the thought that they were intrinsic to the enterprise itself since in  order to carry out its task it had first to free itself from these various methods and forms of history  moreover without the questions that I was asked without the difficulties that arose without the  objections that were made I may never have gained so clear a view of the enterprise to which I am  now inextricably linked Hence the cautious stumbling manner of this text at every turn it stands  back measures up what is before it gropes towards its limits stumbles against what it does not  mean and digs pits to mark out its own path At every turn it denounces any possible confusion It  rejects its identity without previously stating I am neither this nor that It is not critical most of the  time it is not a way of saying that everyone else is wrong It is an attempt to define a particular site  by the exteriority of its vicinity rather than trying to reduce others to silence by claiming that what  they say is worthless I have tried to define this blank space from which I speak      footnote       In particular the first pages of this introduction are based on a reply to questions presented by the Cercle dEpistemologic of  the ENS cf Cahiers pour analyse no 9 A sketch of certain developments was also given in reply to readers of the review  Esprit April 1968   19     and which is slowly taking shape in a discourse that I still feel to be so precarious and so unsure    Arent you sure of what youre saying Are you going to change yet again shift your position according to the   questions that are put to you and say that the objections are not really directed at the place from which you  are speaking Are you going to declare yet again that you have never been what you have been reproached with  being Are you already preparing the way out that will enable you in your next book to spring up somewhere  else and declare as youre now doing no no Im not where you are lying in wait for me but over here laughing  at you   What do you imagine that I would take so much trouble and so much pleasure in writing do you think  that I would keep so persistently to my task if I were not preparing  with a rather shaky hand  a labyrinth  into which I can venture in which I can move my discourse opening up underground passages forcing it to go  far from itself finding overhangs that reduce and deform its itinerary in which I can lose myself and appear at  last to eyes that I will never have to meet again I am no doubt not the only one who writes in order to have no  face Do not ask who I am and do not ask me to remain the same leave it to our bureaucrats and our police to  see that our papers are in order At least spare us their morality when we write   Part II The Discursive Regularities  23       1 THE UNITIES OF DISCOURSE  The use of concepts of discontinuity rupture threshold limit series and transformation present all historical analysis not  only with questions of procedure but with theoretical problems It is these problems that will be studied here the  questions of procedure will be examined in later empirical studies  if the opportunity the desire and the courage to  undertake them do not desert me These theoretical problems too will be examined only in a particular field in those  disciplines  so unsure of their frontiers and so vague in content  that we call the history of ideas or of thought or of  science or of knowledge   But there is a negative work to be carried out first we must rid ourselves of a whole mass of notions each of which in  its own way diversifies the theme of continuity They may not have a very rigorous conceptual structure but they have a  very precise function Take the notion of tradition it is intended to give a special temporal status to a group of  phenomena that are both successive and identical or at least similar it makes it possible to rethink the dispersion of  history in the form of the same it allows a reduction of the difference proper to every beginning in order to pursue  without discontinuity the endless search for the origin tradition enables us to isolate the new against a background of  permanence and to transfer its merit to originality to genius to the decisions proper to individuals Then there is the  notion     24   of influence which provides a support  of too magical a kind to be very amenable to analysis  for the facts of  transmission and communication which refers to an apparently causal process but with neither rigorous delimitation  nor theoretical definition the phenomena of resemblance or repetition which links at a distance and through time  as  if through the mediation of a medium of propagation  such defined unities as individuals oeuvres notions or theories  There are the notions of development and evolution they make it possible to group a succession of dispersed events to  link them to one and the same organizing principle to subject them to the exemplary power of life with its adaptations  its capacity for innovation the incessant correlation of its different elements its systems of assimilation and exchange  to discover already at work in each beginning a principle of coherence and the outline of a future unity to master time  through a perpetually reversible relation between an origin and a term that are never given but are always at work There  is the notion of spirit which enables us to establish between the simultaneous or successive phenomena of a given  period a community of meanings symbolic links an interplay of resemblance and reflexion or which allows the  sovereignty of collective consciousness to emerge as the principle of unity and explanation We must question those  readymade syntheses those groupings that we normally accept before any examination those links whose validity is  recognized from the outset we must oust those forms and obscure forces by which we usually link the discourse of one  man with that of another they must be driven out from the darkness in which they reign And instead of according them     unqualified spontaneous value we must accept in the name of methodological rigour that in the first instance they  concern only a population of dispersed events   We must also question those divisions or groupings with which we have become so familiar Can one accept as such  the distinction between the major types of discourse or that between such forms or genres as science literature  philosophy religion history fiction etc and which tend to create certain great historical individualities We are not  even sure of ourselves when we use these distinctions in our own world of discourse let alone when we are analysing  groups of statements which when first formulated were distributed divided and characterized in a quite different way  after all literature and politics   25  are recent categories which can be applied to medieval culture or even classical culture only by a retrospective  hypothesis and by an interplay of formal analogies or semantic resemblances but neither literature nor  politics nor philosophy and the sciences articulated the field of discourse in the seventeenth or eighteenth  century as they did in the nineteenth century In any case these divisions  whether our own or those  contemporary with the discourse under examination  are always themselves reflexive categories principles of  classification normative rules institutionalized types they in turn are facts of discourse that deserve to be  analysed beside others of course they also have complex relations with each other but they are not intrinsic  autochthonous and universally recognizable characteristics   But the unities that must be suspended above all are those that emerge in the most immediate way those of  the book and the oeuvre At first sight it would seem that one could not abandon these unities without extreme  artificiality Are they not given in the most definite way There is the material individualization of the book  which occupies a determined space which has an economic value and which itself indicates by a number of  signs the limits of its beginning and its end and there is the establishment of an oeuvre which we recognize  and delimit by attributing a certain number of texts to an author And yet as soon as one looks at the matter a  little more closely the difficulties begin The material unity of the book Is this the same in the case of an  anthology of poems a collection of posthumous fragments Desargues Traite des Coniques or a volume of  Michelets Histoire de France Is it the same in the case of Mallarmes Un Coup de des the trial of Gilles de Rais  Butors San Marco or a Catholic missal In other words is not the material unity of the volume a weak  accessory unity in relation to the discursive unity of which it is the support But is this discursive unity itself  homogeneous and uniformly applicable A novel by Stendhal and a novel by Dostoevsky do not have the same  relation of individuality as that between two novels belonging to Balzacs cycle La Comedic humaine and the  relation between Balzacs novels is not the same as that existing between Joyces Ulysses and the Odyssey The  frontiers of a book are never clearcut beyond the title the first lines and the last full stop beyond its internal  configuration and its autonomous form it is caught up in a system of references to other books other texts  other sentences it is a   26  node within a network And this network of references is not the same in the case of a mathematical treatise a textual  commentary a historical account and an episode in a novel cycle the unity of the book even in the sense of a group of  relations cannot be regarded as identical in each case The book is not simply the object that one holds in ones hands  and it cannot remain within the little parallelepiped that contains it its unity is variable and relative As soon as one  questions that unity it loses its selfevidence it indicates itself constructs itself only on the basis of a complex field of  discourse   The problems raised by the oeuvre are even more difficult Yet at first sight what could be more simple A  collection of texts that can be designated by the sign of a proper name But this designation even leaving to one side  problems of attribution is not a homogeneous function does the name of an author designate in the same way a text that  he has published under his name a text that he has presented under a pseudonym another found after his death in the  form of an unfinished draft and another that is merely a collection of jottings a notebook The establishment of a  complete oeuvre presupposes a number of choices that are difficult to justify or even to formulate is it enough to add to  the texts published by the author those that he intended for publication but which remained unfinished by the fact of his  death Should one also include all his sketches and first drafts with all their corrections and crossings out Should one  add sketches that he himself abandoned And what status should be given to letters notes reported conversations  transcriptions of what he said made by those present at the time in short to that vast mass of verbal traces left by an  individual at his death and which speak in an endless confusion so many different languages Iangages In any case  the name Mallarme does not refer in the same way to his themes translation exercises from French into English his  translations of Edgar Allan Poe his poems and his replies to questionnaires similarly the same relation does not exist     between the name Nietzsche on the one hand and the youthful     footnote       The English word language translates the French langue meaning the natural languages French English etc and langage meaning either language  in general or kinds of language philosophical medical language etc Where the meaning would otherwise be unclear I have added the original French  word in brackets Te   27  autobiographies the scholastic dissertations the philological articles Zarathustra Ecce Homo the letters the last  postcards signed Dionysos or Kaiser Nietzsche and the innumerable notebooks with their jumble of laundry bills and  sketches for aphorisms In fact if one speaks so undiscriminately and unreflectingly of an authors oeuvre it is because  one imagines it to be defined by a certain expressive function One is admitting that there must be a level as deep as it is  necessary to imagine it at which the oeuvre emerges in all its fragments even the smallest most inessential ones as the  expression of the thought the experience the imagination or the unconscious of the author or indeed of the historical  determinations that operated upon him But it is at once apparent that such a unity far from being given immediately is  the result of an operation that this operation is interpretative since it deciphers in the text the transcription of something  that it both conceals and manifests and that the operation that determines the opus in its unity and consequently the  oeuvre itself will not be the same in the case of the author of Le Theatre et son Double Artaud and the author of the  Tractatus Wittgenstein and therefore when one speaks of an oeuvre in each case one is using the word in a different  sense The oeuvre can be regarded neither as an immediate unity nor as a certain unity nor as a homogeneous unity   One last precaution must be taken to disconnect the unquestioned continuities by which we organize in advance the  discourse that we are to analyse we must renounce two linked but opposite themes The first involves a wish that it  should never be possible to assign in the order of discourse the irruption of a real event that beyond any apparent  beginning there is always a secret origin  so secret and so fundamental that it can never be quite grasped in itself Thus  one is led inevitably through the naivety of chronologies towards an everreceding point that is never itself present in  any history this point is merely its own void and from that point all beginnings can never be more than  recommencements or occultation in one and the same gesture this and that To this theme is connected another  according to which all manifest discourse is secretly based on an alreadysaid and that this alreadysaid is not merely a  phrase that has already been spoken or a text that has already been written but a neversaid an incorporeal discourse a  voice as silent as a breath a writing that is   28  merely the hollow of its own mark It is supposed therefore that everything that is formulated in discourse was already  articulated in that semisilence that precedes it which continues to run obstinately beneath it but which it covers and  silences The manifest discourse therefore is really no more than the repressive presence of what it does not say and this  notsaid is a hollow that undermines from within all that is said The first theme sees the historical analysis of discourse  as the quest for and the repetition of an origin that eludes all historical determination the second sees it as the  interpretation of hearing of an alreadysaid that is at the same time a notsaid We must renounce all those themes  whose function is to ensure the infinite continuity of discourse and its secret presence to itself in the interplay of a  constantly recurring absence We must be ready to receive every moment of discourse in its sudden irruption in that  punctuality in which it appears and in that temporal dispersion that enables it to be repeated known forgotten  transformed utterly erased and hidden far from all view in the dust of books Discourse must not be referred to the  distant presence of the origin but treated as and when it occurs   These preexisting forms of continuity all these syntheses that are accepted without question must remain in  suspense They must not be rejected definitively of course but the tranquillity with which they are accepted must be  disturbed we must show that they do not come about of themselves but are always the result of a construction the rules  of which must be known and the justifications of which must be scrutinized we must define in what conditions and in  view of which analyses certain of them are legitimate and we must indicate which of them can never be accepted in any  circumstances It may be for example that the notions of influence or evolution belong to a criticism that puts them   for the foreseeable future  out of use But need we dispense for ever with the oeuvre the book or even such unities as  science or literature Should we regard them as illusions illegitimate constructions or illacquired results Should we  never make use of them even as a temporary support and never provide them with a definition What we must do in  fact is to tear away from them their virtual selfevidence and to free the problems that they pose to recognize that they  are not the tranquil locus on the  29     basis of which other questions concerning their structure coherence systematicity transformations may be posed but  that they themselves pose a whole cluster of questions What are they How can they be defined or limited What distinct  types of laws can they obey What articulation are they capable of What subgroups can they give rise to What specific  phenomena do they reveal in the field of discourse We must recognize that they may not in the last resort be what they  seem at first sight In short that they require a theory and that this theory cannot be constructed unless the field of the  facts of discourse on the basis of which those facts are built up appears in its nonsynthetic purity   And I in turn will do no more than this of course I shall take as my startingpoint whatever unities are already given  such as psychopathology medicine or political economy  but I shall not place myself inside these dubious unities in  order to study their internal configuration or their secret contradictions I shall make use of them just long enough to ask  myself what unities they form by what right they can claim a field that specifies them in space and a continuity that indi vidualizes them in time according to what laws they are formed against the background of which discursive events they  stand out and whether they are not in their accepted and quasiinstitutional individuality ultimately the surface effect of  more firmly grounded unities I shall accept the groupings that history suggests only to subject them at once to  interrogation to break them up and then to see whether they can be legitimately reformed or whether other groupings  should be made to replace them in a more general space which while dissipating their apparent familiarity makes it  possible to construct a theory of them   Once these immediate forms of continuity are suspended an entire field is set free A vast field but one that can be  defined nonetheless this field is made up of the totality of all effective statements whether spoken or written in their  dispersion as events and in the occurrence that is proper to them Before approaching with any degree of certainty a  science or novels or political speeches or the oeuvre of an author or even a single book the material with which one is  dealing is in its raw neutral state a population of events in the space of discourse in general One is led therefore to the  project of a pure description of discursive events as the horizon for the search for the unities that form   30  within it This description is easily distinguishable from an analysis of the language Of course a linguistic system can be  established unless it is constructed artificially only by using a corpus of statements or a collection of discursive facts  but we must then define on the basis of this grouping which has value as a sample rules that may make it possible to  construct other statements than these even if it has long since disappeared even if it is no longer spoken and can be  reconstructed only on the basis of rare fragments a language longue is still a system for possible statements a finite  body of rules that authorizes an infinite number of performances The field of discursive events on the other hand is a  grouping that is always finite and limited at any moment to the linguistic sequences that have been formulated they may  be innumerable they may in sheer size exceed the capacities of recording memory or reading nevertheless they form a  finite grouping The question posed by language analysis of some discursive fact or other is always according to what  rules has a particular statement been made and consequently according to what rules could other similar statements be  made The description of the events of discourse poses a quite different question how is it that one particular statement  appeared rather than another   It is also clear that this description of discourses is in opposition to the history of thought There too a system of  thought can be reconstituted only on the basis of a definite discursive totality But this totality is treated in such a way that  one tries to rediscover beyond the statements themselves the intention of the speaking subject his conscious activity  what he meant or again the unconscious activity that took place despite himself in what he said or in the almost  imperceptible fracture of his actual words in any case we must reconstitute another discourse rediscover the silent  murmuring the inexhaustible speech that animates from within the voice that one hears reestablish the tiny invisible  text that runs between and sometimes collides with them The analysis of thought is always allegorical in relation to the  discourse that it employs Its question is unfailingly what was being said in what was said The analysis of the discursive  field is orientated in a quite different way we must grasp the statement in the exact specificity of its occurrence  determine its conditions of existence fix at least its limits establish its correlations with other statements that     31   may be connected with it and show what other forms of statement it excludes We do not seek below what is manifest the  half silent murmur of another discourse we must show why it could not be other than it was in what respect it is  exclusive of any other how it assumes in the midst of others and in relation to them a place that no other could occupy  The question proper to such an analysis might be formulated in this way what is this specific existence that emerges from  what is said and nowhere else   We must ask ourselves what purpose is ultimately served by this suspension of all the accepted unities if in the end  we return to the unities that we pretended to question at the outset In fact the systematic erasure of all given unities  enables us first of all to restore to the statement the specificity of its occurrence and to show that discontinuity is one of  those great accidents that create cracks not only in the geology of history but also in the simple fact of the statement it  emerges in its historical irruption what we try to examine is the incision that it makes that irreducible  and very often  tiny  emergence However banal it may be however unimportant its consequences may appear to be however quickly     it may be forgotten after its appearance however little heard or however badly deciphered we may suppose it to be a  statement is always an event that neither the language langue nor the meaning can quite exhaust It is certainly a strange  event first because on the one hand it is linked to the gesture of writing or to the articulation of speech and also on the  other hand it opens up to itself a residual existence in the field of a memory or in the materiality of manuscripts books  or any other form of recording secondly because like every event it is unique yet subject to repetition transformation  and reactivation thirdly because it is linked not only to the situations that provoke it and to the consequences that it  gives rise to but at the same time and in accordance with a quite different modality to the statements that precede and  follow it   But if we isolate in relation to the language and to thought the occurrence of the statementevent it is not in order to  spread over everything a dust of facts It is in order to be sure that this occurrence is not linked with synthesizing  operations of a purely psychological kind the intention of the author the form of his mind the rigour of his thought the  themes that obsess him the project that traverses his         32  existence and gives it meaning and to be able to grasp other forms of regularity other types of relations Relations  between statements even if the author is unaware of them even if the statements do not have the same author even  if the authors were unaware of each others existence  relations between groups of statements thus established  even if these groups do not concern the same or even adjacent fields even if they do not possess the same formal  level even if they are not the locus of assignable exchanges relations between statements and groups of  statements and events of a quite different kind technical economic social political To reveal in all its purity the  space in which discursive events are deployed is not to undertake to reestablish it in an isolation that nothing could  overcome it is not to close it upon itself it is to leave oneself free to describe the interplay of relations within it and  outside it   The third purpose of such a description of the facts of discourse is that by freeing them of all the groupings that  purport to be natural immediate universal unities one is able to describe other unities but this time by means of a  group of controlled decisions Providing one defines the conditions clearly it might be legitimate to constitute on  the basis of correctly described relations discursive groups that are not arbitrary and yet remain invisible Of  course these relations would never be formulated for themselves in the statements in question unlike for example  those explicit relations that are posed and spoken in discourse itself as in the form of the novel or a series of  mathematical theorems But in no way would they constitute a sort of secret discourse animating the manifest  discourse from within it is not therefore an interpretation of the facts of the statement that might reveal them but  the analysis of their coexistence their succession their mutual functioning their reciprocal determination and their  independent or correlative transformation   However it is not possible to describe all the relations that may emerge in this way without some guidelines A  provisional division must be adopted as an initial approximation an initial region that analysis will subsequently  demolish and if necessary reorganize But how is such a region to be circumscribed On the one hand we must  choose empirically a field in which the relations are likely to be numerous dense and relatively easy to describe  and in what other   33  region do discursive events appear to be more closely linked to one another to occur in accordance with more easily  decipherable relations than in the region usually known as science But on the other hand what better way of grasping  in a statement not the moment of its formal structure and laws of construction but that of its existence and the rules that  govern its appearance if not by dealing with relatively unformalized groups of discourses in which the statements do  not seem necessarily to be built on the rules of pure syntax How can we be sure of avoiding such divisions as the  cruvre or such categories as influence unless from the very outset we adopt sufficiently broad fields and scales that  are chronologically vast enough Lastly how can we be sure that we will not find ourselves in the grip of all those over hasty unities or syntheses concerning the speaking subject or the author of the text in short all anthropological  categories Unless perhaps we consider all the statements out of which these categories are constituted  all the  statements that have chosen the subject of discourse their own subject as their object and have undertaken to deploy it  as their field of knowledge   This explains the de facto privilege that I have accorded to those discourses that to put it very schematically define  the sciences of man But it is only a provisional privilege Two facts must be constantly borne in mind that the analysis  of discursive events is in no way limited to such a field and that the division of this field itself cannot be regarded either     as definitive or as absolutely valid it is no more than an initial approximation that must allow relations to appear that  may erase the limits of this initial outline     34   2 DISCURSIVE FORMATIONS   I have undertaken then to describe the relations between statements I have been careful to accept as valid none of the  unities that would normally present themselves to anyone embarking on such a task I have decided to ignore no form of  discontinuity break threshold or limit I have decided to describe statements in the field of discourse and the relations of  which they are capable As I see it two series of problems arise at the outset the first which I shall leave to one side for  the time being and shall return to later concerns the indiscriminate use that I have made of the terms statement event  and discourse the second concerns the relations that may legitimately he described between the statements that have been  left in their provisional visible grouping   There are statements for example that are quite obviously concerned  and have been from a date that is easy  enough to determine  with political economy or biology or psychopathology there are others that equally obviously  belong to those ageold continuities known as grammar or medicine But what are these unities How can we say that the  analysis of headaches carried out by Willis or Charcot belong to the same order of discourse That Pettys inventions are  in continuity with Neumanns econometry That the analysis of judgement by the PortRoyal grammarians belongs to the  same domain as   35  the discovery of vowel gradations in the IndoEuropean languages What in fact are medicine grammar or political  economy Are they merely a retrospective regrouping by which the contemporary sciences deceive themselves as to their  own past Are they forms that have become established once and for all and have gone on developing through time Do  they conceal other unities And what sort of links can validly be recognized between all these statements that form in  such a familiar and insistent way such an enigmatic mass   First hypothesis  and the one that at first sight struck me as being the most likely and the most easily proved  statements different in form and dispersed in time form a group if they refer to one and the same object Thus  statements belonging to psychopathology all seem to refer to an object that emerges in various ways in individual or  social experience and which may be called madness But I soon realized that the unity of the object madness does not  enable one to individualize a group of statements and to establish between them a relation that is both constant and  describable There are two reasons for this It would certainly be a mistake to try to discover what could have been said of  madness at a particular time by interrogating the being of madness itself its secret content its silent selfenclosed truth  mental illness was constituted by all that was said in all the statements that named it divided it up described it explained  it traced its developments indicated its various correlations judged it and possibly gave it speech by articulating in its  name discourses that were to be taken as its own Moreover this group of statements is far from referring to a single  object formed once and for all and to preserving it indefinitely as its horizon of inexhaustible ideality the object  presented as their correlative by medical statements of the seventeenth or eighteenth century is not identical with the  object that emerges in legal sentences or police action similarly all the objects of psychopathological discourses were  modified from Pinel or Esquirol to Bleuler it is not the same illnesses that are at issue in each of these cases we are not  dealing with the same madmen   One might perhaps one should conclude from this multiplicity of objects that it is not possible to accept as a valid  unity forming a group of statements a discourse concerning madness Perhaps one should confine ones attention to  those groups of statements that have one and        36  the same object the discourses on melancholia or neurosis for example But one would soon realize that each of these  discourses in turn constituted its object and worked it to the point of transforming it altogether So that the problem arises  of knowing whether the unity of a discourse is based not so much on the permanence and uniqueness of an object as on  the space in which various objects emerge and are continuously transformed Would not the typical relation that would  enable us to individualize a group of statements concerning madness then be the rule of simultaneous or successive     emergence of the various objects that are named described analysed appreciated or judged in that relation The unity of  discourses on madness would not be based upon the existence of the object madness or the constitution of a single  horizon of objectivity it would be the interplay of the rules that make possible the appearance of objects during a given  period of time objects that are shaped by measures of discrimination and repression objects that are differentiated in  daily practice in law in religious casuistry in medical diagnosis objects that are manifested in pathological descriptions  objects that are circumscribed by medical codes practices treatment and care Moreover the unity of the discourses on  madness would be the interplay of the rules that define the transformations of these different objects their nonidentity  through time the break produced in them the internal discontinuity that suspends their permanence Paradoxically to  define a group of statements in terms of its individuality would be to define the dispersion of these objects to grasp all  the interstices that separate them to measure the distances that reign between them  in other words to formulate their  law of division   Second hypothesis to define a group of relations between statements their form and type of connexion It seemed to  me for example that from the nineteenth century medical science was characterized not so much by its objects or  concepts as by a certain style a certain constant manner of statement For the first time medicine no longer consisted of a  group of traditions observations and heterogeneous practices but of a corpus of knowledge that presupposed the same  way of looking at things the same division of the perceptual field the same analysis of the pathological fact in  accordance with the visible space of the body the same system of transcribing what one        37     perceived in what one said same vocabulary same play of metaphor in short it seemed to me that medicine was  organized as a series of descriptive statements But there again I had to abandon this hypothesis at the outset and  recognize that clinical discourse was just as much a group of hypotheses about life and death of ethical choices of thera peutic decisions of institutional regulations of teaching models as a group of descriptions that the descriptions could  not in any case be abstracted from the hypotheses and that the descriptive statement was only one of the formulations  present in medical discourse I also had to recognize that this description has constantly been displaced either because  from Bichat to cell pathology the scales and guidelines have been displaced or because from visual inspection  auscultation and palpation to the use of the microscope and biological tests the information system has been modified or  again because from simple anatomoclinical correlation to the delicate analysis of physiopathological processes the  lexicon of signs and their decipherment has been entirely reconstituted or finally because the doctor has gradually  ceased to be himself the locus of the registering and interpretation of information and because beside him outside him  there have appeared masses of documentation instruments of correlation and techniques of analysis which of course he  makes use of but which modify his position as an observing subject in relation to the patient   All these alterations which may now lead to the threshold of a new medicine gradually appeared in medical discourse  throughout the nineteenth century If one wished to define this discourse by a codified and normative system of statement  one would have to recognize that this medicine disintegrated as soon as it appeared and that it really found its formulation  only in Bichat and Laennec If there is a unity its principle is not therefore a determined form of statements is it not  rather the group of rules which simultaneously or in turn have made possible purely perceptual descriptions together  with observations mediated through instruments the procedures used in laboratory experiments statistical calculations  epidemiological or demographic observations institutional regulations and therapeutic practice What one must  characterize and individualize is the coexistence of these dispersed and heterogeneous statements the system that governs  their division the degree to which they depend upon one another the way   38   in which they interlock or exclude one another the transformation that they undergo and the play of their location  arrangement and replacement   Another direction of research another hypothesis might it not be possible to establish groups of statements by  determining the system of permanent and coherent concepts involved For example does not the Classical analysis of  language and grammatical facts from Lancelot to the end of the eighteenth century rest on a definite number of concepts  whose content and usage had been established once and for all the concept of judgement defined as the general  normative form of any sentence the concepts of subject and predicate regrouped under the more general category of  noun the concept of verb used as the equivalent of that of logical copula the concept of word defined as the sign of a  representation etc In this way one might reconstitute the conceptual architecture of Classical grammar But there too  one would soon come up against limitations no sooner would one have succeeded in describing with such elements the  analyses carried out by the PortRoyal authors than one would no doubt be forced to acknowledge the appearance of new  concepts some of these may be derived from the first but the others are heterogeneous and a few even incompatible with  them The notion of natural or inverted syntactical order that of complement introduced in the eighteenth century by  Beauzee may still no doubt be integrated into the conceptual system of the PortRoyal grammar But neither the idea of  an originally expressive value of sounds nor that of a primitive body of knowledge enveloped in words and conveyed in  some obscure way by them nor that of regularity in the mutation of consonants nor the notion of the verb as a mere  name capable of designating an action or operation is compatible with the group of concepts used by Lancelot or Duclos  Must we admit therefore that grammar only appears to form a coherent figure and that this group of statements analyses  descriptions principles and consequences deductions that has been perpetrated under this name for over a century is no  more than a false unity But perhaps one might discover a discursive unity if one sought it not in the coherence of  concepts but in their simultaneous or successive emergence in the distance that separates them and even in their  incompatibility One would no longer seek an architecture of concepts sufficiently general   39  and abstract to embrace all others and to introduce them into the same deductive structure one would try to analyse the  interplay of their appearances and dispersion   Lastly a fourth hypothesis to regroup the statements describe their interconnexion and account for the unitary forms  under which they are presented the identity and persistence of themes In sciences like economics or biology which are  so controversial in character so open to philosophical or ethical options so exposed in certain cases to political  manipulation it is legitimate in the first instance to suppose that a certain thematic is capable of linking and animating a  group of discourses like an organism with its own needs its own internal force and its own capacity for survival Could     one not for example constitute as a unity everything that has constituted the evolutionist theme from Buffon to Darwin  A theme that in the first instance was more philosophical closer to cosmology than to biology a theme that directed  research from afar rather than named regrouped and explained results a theme that always presupposed more than one  was aware of but which on the basis of this fundamental choice forcibly transformed into discursive knowledge what  had been outlined as a hypothesis or as a necessity Could one not speak of the Physiocratic theme in the same way An  idea that postulated beyond all demonstration and prior to all analysis the natural character of the three ground rents  which consequently presupposed the economic and political primacy of agrarian property which excluded all analysis of  the mechanisms of industrial production which implied on the other hand the description of the circulation of money  within a state of its distribution between different social categories and of the channels by which it flowed back into  production which finally led Ricardo to consider those cases in which this triple rent did not appear the conditions in  which it could form and consequently to denounce the arbitrariness of the Physiocratic theme   But on the basis of such an attempt one is led to make two inverse and complementary observations In one case the  same thematic is articulated on the basis of two sets of concepts two types of analysis two perfectly different fields of  objects in its most general formulation the evolutionist idea is perhaps the same in the work of Benoit de Maillet  Borden or Diderot and in that of Darwin but in fact what     40   makes it possible and coherent is not at all the same thing in either case In the eighteenth century the evolutionist idea is  defined on the basis of a kinship of species forming a continuum laid down at the outset interrupted only by natural  catastrophes or gradually built up by the passing of time In the nineteenth century the evolutionist theme concerns not so  much the constitution of a continuous table of species as the description of discontinuous groups and the analysis of the  modes of interaction between an organism whose elements are interdependent and an environment that provides its real  conditions of life A single theme but based on two types of discourse In the case of Physiocracy on the other hand  Quesnays choice rests exactly on the same system of concepts as the opposite opinion held by those that might be called  utilitarists At this period the analysis of wealth involved a relatively limited set of concepts that was accepted by all  coinage was given the same definition prices were given the same explanation and labour costs were calculated in the  same way But on the basis of this single set of concepts there were two ways of explaining the formation of value  according to whether it was analysed on the basis of exchange or on that of remuneration for the days work These two  possibilities contained within economic theory and in the rules of its set of concepts resulted on the basis of the same  elements in two different options   It would probably be wrong therefore to seek in the existence of these themes the principles of the individualization of  a discourse Should they not be sought rather in the dispersion of the points of choice that the discourse leaves free In the  different possibilities that it opens of reanimating already existing themes of arousing opposed strategies of giving way  to irreconcilable interests of making it possible with a particular set of concepts to play different games Rather than  seeking the permanence of themes images and opinions through time rather than retracing the dialectic of their conflicts  in order to individualize groups of statements could one not rather mark out the dispersion of the points of choice and  define prior to any option to any thematic preference a field of strategic possibilities   I am presented therefore with four attempts four failures  and four successive hypotheses They must now be put to  the test Concerning those large groups of statements with which we are so familiar  and     41   which we call medicine economics or grammar  I have asked myself on what their unity could be based On a full  tightly packed continuous geographically welldefined field of objects What appeared to me were rather series full of  gaps intertwined with one another interplays of differences distances substitutions transformations On a definite  normative type of statement I found formulations of levels that were much too different and functions that were much  too heterogeneous to be linked together and arranged in a single figure and to simulate from one period to another  beyond individual oeuvres a sort of great uninterrupted text On a welldefined alphabet of notions One is confronted  with concepts that differ in structure and in the rules governing their use which ignore or exclude one another and  which cannot enter the unity of a logical architecture On the permanence of a thematic What one finds are rather  various strategic possibilities that permit the activation of incompatible themes or again the establishment of the same  theme in different groups of statement Hence the idea of describing these dispersions themselves of discovering  whether between these elements which are certainly not organized as a progressively deductive structure nor as an  enormous book that is being gradually and continuously written nor as the oeuvre of a collective subject one cannot  discern a regularity an order in their successive appearance correlations in their simultaneity assignable positions in a  common space a reciprocal functioning linked and hierarchized transformations Such an analysis would not try to  isolate small islands of coherence in order to describe their internal structure it would not try to suspect and to reveal  latent conflicts it would study forms of division Or again instead of reconstituting chains of inference as one often     does in the history of the sciences or of philosophy instead of drawing up tables of differences as the linguists do it  would describe systems of dispersion   Whenever one can describe between a number of statements such a system of dispersion whenever between objects  types of statement concepts or thematic choices one can define a regularity an order correlations positions and  functionings transformations we will say for the sake of convenience that we are dealing with a discursive formation   thus avoiding words that are already overladen with conditions and consequences and in any case inadequate to the  task of designating        42   such a dispersion such as science ideology theory or domain of objectivity The conditions to which the elements of  this division objects mode of statement concepts thematic choices are subjected we shall call the rules of formation  The rules of formation are conditions of existence but also of coexistence maintenance modification and  disappearance in a given discursive division   This then is the field to be covered these the notions that we must put to the test and the analyses that we must carry  out I am well aware that the risks are considerable For an initial probe I made use of certain fairly loose but familiar  groups of statement I have no proof that I shall find them again at the end of the analysis nor that I shall discover the  principle of their delimitation and individualization I am not sure that the discursive formations that I shall isolate will  define medicine in its overall unity or economics and grammar in the overall curve of their historical destination they  may even introduce unexpected boundaries and divisions Similarly I have no proof that such a description will be able  to take account of the scientificity or nonscientificity of the discursive groups that I have taken as an attack point and  which presented themselves at the outset with a certain pretension to scientific rationality I have no proof that my  analysis will not be situated at a quite different level constituting a description that is irreducible to epistemology or to  the history of the sciences Moreover at the end of such an enterprise one may not recover those unities that out of  methodological rigour one initially held in suspense one may be compelled to dissociate certain euvres ignore  influences and traditions abandon definitively the question of origin allow the commanding presence of authors to fade  into the background and thus everything that was thought to be proper to the history of ideas may disappear from view  The danger in short is that instead of providing a basis for what already exists instead of going over with bold strokes  lines that have already been sketched instead of finding reassurance in this return and final confirmation instead of  completing the blessed circle that announces after innumerable stratagems and as many nights that all is saved one is  forced to advance beyond familiar territory far from the certainties to which one is accustomed towards an as yet  uncharted land and unforeseeable conclusion Is there not a danger that everything that has so far protected the historian  in his daily        43  journey and accompanied him until nightfall the destiny of rationality and the teleology of the sciences the long  continuous labour of thought from period to period the awakening and the progress of consciousness its perpetual  resumption of itself the uncompleted but uninterrupted movement of totalizations the return to an everopen source and  finally the historicotranscendental thematic may disappear leaving for analysis a blank indifferent space lacking in  both interiority and promise    44   3 THE FORMATION OF OBJECTS   We must now list the various directions that lie open to us and see whether this notion of rules of formation  of which  little more than a rough sketch has so far been provided  can be given real content Let us look first at the formation of  objects And in order to facilitate our analysis let us take as an example the discourse of psychopathology from the  nineteenth century onwards  a chronological break that is easy enough to accept in a first approach to the subject There     are enough signs to indicate it but let us take just two of these the establishment at the beginning of the century of a new  mode of exclusion and confinement of the madman in a psychiatric hospital and the possibility of tracing certain present day notions back to Esquirol Heinroth or Pinel paranoia can be traced back to monomania the intelligence quotient to  the initial notion of imbecility general paralysis to chronic encephalitis character neurosis to nondelirious madness  whereas if we try to trace the development of psychopathology beyond the nineteenth century we soon lose our way the  path becomes confused and the projection of Du Laurens or even Van Swieten on the pathology of Kraepelin or Bleuler  provides no more than chance coincidences The objects with which psychopathology has dealt since this break in time  are very numerous mostly very new but also very precarious subject to change and in some cases to rapid   45  disappearance in addition to motor disturbances hallucinations and speech disorders which were already regarded as  manifestations of madness although they were recognized delimited described and analysed in a different way  objects appeared that belonged to hitherto unused registers minor behavioural disorders sexual aberrations and  disturbances the phenomena of suggestion and hypnosis lesions of the central nervous system deficiencies of  intellectual or motor adaptation criminality And on the basis of each of these registers a variety of objects were named  circumstances scribed analysed then rectified redefined challenged erased Is it possible to lay down the rule to  which their appearance was subject Is it possible to discover according to which nondeductive system these objects  could be juxtaposed and placed in succession to form the fragmented field  showing at certain points great gaps at  others a plethora of information  of psychopathology What has ruled their existence as objects of discourse     a First we must map the first surfaces of their emergence show where these individual differences which  according to the degrees of rationalization conceptual codes and types of theory will be accorded the status of disease  alienation anomaly dementia neurosis or psychosis degeneration etc may emerge and then be designated and  analysed These surfaces of emergence are not the same for different societies at different periods and in different  forms of discourse In the case of nineteenthcentury psychopathology they were probably constituted by the family the  immediate social group the work situation the religious community which are all normative which are all susceptible  to deviation which all have a margin of tolerance and a threshold beyond which exclusion is demanded which all have  a mode of designation and a mode of rejecting madness which all transfer to medicine if not the responsibility for  treatment and cure at least the burden of explanation although organized according to a specific mode these surfaces  of emergence were not new in the nineteenth century On the other hand it was no doubt at this period that new surfaces  of appearance began to function art with its own normativity sexuality its deviations in relation to customary  prohibitions become for the first time an object of observation description and analysis for psychiatric        46  discourse penality whereas in previous periods madness was carefully distinguished from criminal conduct and was  regarded as an excuse criminality itself becomes  and subsequent to the celebrated homicidal monomanias  a form  of deviance more or less related to madness In these fields of initial differentiation in the distances the discontinuities  and the thresholds that appear within it psychiatric discourse finds a way of limiting its domain of defining what it is  talking about of giving it the status of an object  and therefore of making it manifest nameable and describable     bWe must also describe the authorities of delimitation in the nineteenth century medicine as an institution  possessing its own rules as a group of individuals constituting the medical profession as a body of knowledge and  practice as an authority recognized by public opinion the law and government became the major authority in  society that delimited designated named and established madness as an object but it was not alone in this the law  and penal law in particular with the definitions of excuse nonresponsibility extenuating circumstances and with  the application of such notions as the crime passionel heredity danger to society the religious authority in so far  as it set itself up as the authority that divided the mystical from the pathological the spiritual from the corporeal the  supernatural from the abnormal and in so far as it practised the direction of conscience with a view to understanding  individuals rather than carrying out a casuistical classification of actions and circumstances literary and art criticism  which in the nineteenth century treated the work less and less as an object of taste that had to be judged and more  and more as a language that had to be interpreted and in which the authors tricks of expression had to be recognized   cLastly we must analyse the grids of specification these are the systems according to which the different  kinds of madness are divided contrasted related regrouped classified derived from one another as objects of  psychiatric discourse in the nineteenth century these grids of differentiation were the soul as a group of  hierarchized related and more or less interpenetrable faculties the body as a threedimensional volume of organs     linked together by networks of       47  dependence and communication the life and history of individuals as a linear succession of phases a tangle of traces a  group of potential reactivations cyclical repetitions the interplays of neuropsychological correlations as systems of  reciprocal projections and as a field of circular causality     Such a description is still in itself inadequate And for two reasons These planes of emergence authorities of  delimitation or forms of specification do not provide objects fully formed and armed that the discourse of  psychopathology has then merely to list classify name select and cover with a network of words and sentences it is not  the families  with their norms their prohibitions their sensitivity thresholds  that decide who is mad and present the  patients to the psychiatrists for analysis and judgement it is not the legal system itself that hands over certain criminals  to psychiatry that sees paranoia beyond a particular murder or a neurosis behind a sexual offence It would be quite  wrong to see discourse as a place where previously established objects are laid one after another like words on a page  But the above enumeration is inadequate for a second reason It has located one after another several planes of  differentiation in which the objects of discourse may appear But what relations exist between them Why this  enumeration rather than another What defined and closed group does one imagine one is circumscribing in this way  And how can one speak of a system of formation if one knows only a series of different heterogeneous determinations  lacking attributable links and relations   In fact these two series of questions refer back to the same point In order to locate that point let us reexamine the  previous example In the sphere with which psychopathology dealt in the nineteenth century one sees the very early  appearance as early as Esquirol of a whole series of objects belonging to the category of delinquency homicide and  suicide crimes passionels sexual offences certain forms of theft vagrancy  and then through them heredity the  neurogenic environment aggressive or selfpunishing behaviour perversions criminal impulses suggestibility etc It  would be inadequate to say that one was dealing here with the consequences of a discovery of the sudden discovery by a  psychiatrist of a resemblance between criminal and pathological behaviour a discovery of the presence in certain        48  delinquents of the classical signs of alienation or mental derangement Such facts lie beyond the grasp of contemporary  research indeed the problem is how to decide what made them possible and how these discoveries could lead to others  that took them up rectified them modified them or even disproved them Similarly it would he irrelevant to attribute the  appearance of these new objects to the norms of nineteenthcentury bourgeois society to a reinforced police and penal  framework to the establishment of a new code of criminal justice to the introduction and use of extenuating  circumstances to the increase in crime No doubt all these processes were at work but they could not of themselves form  objects for psychiatric discourse to pursue the description at this level one would fall short of what one was seeking   If in a particular period in the history of our society the delinquent was psychologized and pathologized if criminal  behaviour could give rise to a whole series of objects of knowledge this was because a group of particular relations was  adopted for use in psychiatric discourse The relation between planes of specification like penal categories and degrees of  diminished responsibility and planes of psychological characterization faculties aptitudes degrees of development or  involution different ways of reacting to the environment character types whether acquired innate or hereditary The  relation between the authority of medical decision and the authority of judicial decision a really complex relation since  medical decision recognizes absolutely the authority of the judiciary to define crime to determine the circumstances in  which it is committed and the punishment that it deserves but reserves the right to analyse its origin and to determine the  degree of responsibility involved The relation between the filter formed by judicial interrogation police information  investigation and the whole machinery of judicial information and the filter formed by the medical questionnaire  clinical examinations the search for antecedents and biographical accounts The relation between the family sexual and  penal norms of the behaviour of individuals and the table of pathological symptoms and diseases of which they are the  signs The relation between therapeutic confinement in hospital with its own thresholds its criteria of cure its way of  distinguishing the normal from the pathological and punitive confinement in prison with its system of punishment and  pedagogy its criteria of good conduct improvement        49  and freedom These are the relations that operating in psychiatric discourse have made possible the formation of a  whole group of various objects   Let us generalize in the nineteenth century psychiatric discourse is characterized not by privileged objects but by  the way in which it forms objects that are in fact highly dispersed This formation is made possible by a group of  relations established between authorities of emergence delimitation and specification One might say then that a  discursive formation is defined as far as its objects are concerned at least if one can establish such a group if one can     show how any particular object of discourse finds in it its place and law of emergence if one can show that it may give  birth simultaneously or successively to mutually exclusive objects without having to modify itself   Hence a certain number of remarks and consequences     1The conditions necessary for the appearance of an object of discourse the historical conditions required if one is  to say anything about it and if several people are to say different things about it the conditions necessary if it is to  exist in relation to other objects if it is to establish with them relations of resemblance proximity distance dif ference transformation  as we can see these conditions are many and imposing Which means that one cannot  speak of anything at any time it is not easy to say something new it is not enough for us to open our eyes to pay  attention or to be aware for new objects suddenly to light up and emerge out of the ground But this difficulty is not  only a negative one it must not be attached to some obstacle whose power appears to be exclusively to blind to  hinder to prevent discovery to conceal the purity of the evidence or the dumb obstinacy of the things themselves the  object does not await in limbo the order that will free it and enable it to become embodied in a visible and prolix  objectivity it does not preexist itself held back by some obstacle at the first edges of light It exists under the  positive conditions of a complex group of relations     2These relations are established between institutions economic and social processes behavioural patterns   systems of norms techniques types of classification modes of characterization and these       50  relations are not present in the object it is not they that are deployed when the object is being analysed they do not  indicate the web the immanent rationality that ideal nervure that reappears totally or in part when one conceives of the  object in the truth of its concept They do not define its internal constitution but what enables it to appear to juxtapose  itself with other objects to situate itself in relation to them to define its difference its irreducibility and even perhaps its  heterogeneity in short to be placed in a field of exteriority     3These relations must be distinguished first from what we might call primary relations and which independently  of all discourse or all object of discourse may be described between institutions techniques social forms etc After  all we know very well that relations existed between the bourgeois family and the functioning of judicial authorities  and categories in the nineteenth century that can he analysed in their own right They cannot always be superposed  upon the relations that go to form objects the relations of dependence that may be assigned to this primary level are  not necessarily expressed in the formation of relations that makes discursive objects possible But we must also  distinguish the secondary relations that are formulated in discourse itself what for example the psychiatrists of the  nineteenth century could say about the relations between the family and criminality does not reproduce as we know  the interplay of real dependencies but neither does it reproduce the interplay of relations that make possible and  sustain the objects of psychiatric discourse Thus a space unfolds articulated with possible discourses a system of real  or primary relations a system of reflexive or secondary relations and a system of relations that might properly be  called discursive The problem is to reveal the specificity of these discursive relations and their interplay with the  other two kinds     4Discursive relations are not as we can see internal to discourse they do not connect concepts or words with one   another they do not establish a deductive or rhetorical structure between propositions or sentences Yet they are not  relations exterior to discourse relations that might limit it or impose certain forms upon it or force it in certain  circumstances to state certain things They are in a sense at the limit        51  of discourse they offer it objects of which it can speak or rather for this image of offering presupposes that objects are  formed independently of discourse they determine the group of relations that discourse must establish in order to speak  of this or that object in order to deal with them name them analyse them classify them explain them etc These  relations characterize not the language langue used by discourse nor the circumstances in which it is deployed but  discourse itself as a practice     We can now complete the analysis and see to what extent it fulfils and to what extent it modifies the initial project  Taking those group figures which in an insistent but confused way presented themselves as psychology economics   grammar medicine we asked on what kind of unity they could be based were they simply a reconstruction after the  event based on particular works successive theories notions and themes some of which had been abandoned others  maintained by tradition and again others fated to fall into oblivion only to be revived at a later date Were they simply a  series of linked enterprises     We sought the unity of discourse in the objects themselves in their distribution in the interplay of their differences in  their proximity or distance  in short in what is given to the speaking subject and in the end we are sent back to a  settingup of relations that characterizes discursive practice itself and what we discover is neither a configuration nor a  form but a group of rules that are immanent in a practice and define it in its specificity We also used as a point of  reference a unity like psychopathology if we had wanted to provide it with a date of birth and precise limits it would no  doubt have been necessary to discover when the word was first used to what kind of analysis it could be applied and  how it achieved its separation from neurology on the one hand and psychology on the other What has emerged is a unity  of another type which does not appear to have the same dates or the same surface or the same articulations but which  may take account of a group of objects for which the term psychopathology was merely a reflexive secondary  classificatory rubric Psychopathology finally emerged as a discipline in a constant state of renewal subject to constant  discoveries criticisms and corrected errors the system of        52  formation that we have defined remains stable But let there be no misunderstanding it is not the objects that remain  constant nor the domain that they form it is not even their point of emergence or their mode of characterization but the  relation between the surfaces on which they appear on which they can be delimited on which they can be analysed and  specified   In the descriptions for which I have attempted to provide a theory there can be no question of interpreting discourse  with a view to writing a history of the referent In the example chosen we are not trying to find out who was mad at a  particular period or in what his madness consisted or whether his disturbances were identical with those known to us  today We are not asking ourselves whether witches were unrecognized and presecuted madmen and madwomen or  whether at a different period a mystical or aesthetic experience was not unduly medicalized We are not trying to  reconstitute what madness itself might be in the form in which it first presented itself to some primitive fundamental  deaf scarcely articulated experience and in the form in which it was later organized translated deformed travestied  perhaps even repressed by discourses and the oblique often twisted play of their operations Such a history of the  referent is no doubt possible and I have no wish at the outset to exclude any effort to uncover and free these  prediscursive experiences from the tyranny of the text But what we are concerned with here is not to neutralize  discourse to make it the sign of something else and to pierce through its density in order to reach what remains silently  anterior to it but on the contrary to maintain it in its consistency to make it emerge in its own complexity What in short  we wish to do is to dispense with things To depresentify them To conjure up their rich heavy immediate plenitude  which we usually regard as the primitive law of a discourse that has become divorced from it through error oblivion  illusion ignorance or the inertia of beliefs and traditions or even the perhaps unconscious desire not to see and not to  speak To substitute for the enigmatic treasure of things anterior to discourse the regular formation of objects that  emerge only in     footnote       This is written against an explicit theme of my book Madness and Civilization and one that recurs particularly in the preface  53        discourse To define these objects without reference to the ground the foundation of things but by relating them to the  body of rules that enable them to form as objects of a discourse and thus constitute the conditions of their historical  appearance To write a history of discursive objects that does not plunge them into the common depth of a primal soil but  deploys the nexus of regularities that govern their dispersion   However to suppress the stage of things themselves is not necessarily to return to the linguistic analysis of meaning  When one describes the formation of the objects of a discourse one tries to locate the relations that characterize a  discursive practice one determines neither a lexical organization nor the scansions of a semantic field one does not  question the meaning given at a particular period to such words as melancholia or madness without delirium nor the  opposition of content between psychosis and neurosis Not I repeat that such analyses are regarded as illegitimate or  impossible but they are not relevant when we are trying to discover for example how criminality could become an  object of medical expertise or sexual deviation a possible object of psychiatric discourse The analysis of lexical contents  defines either the elements of meaning at the disposal of speaking subjects in a given period or the semantic structure  that appears on the surface of a discourse that has already been spoken it does not concern discursive practice as a place  in which a tangled plurality  at once superposed and incomplete  of objects is formed and deformed appears and  disappears     The sagacity of the commentators is not mistaken from the kind of analysis that I have undertaken words are as  deliberately absent as things themselves any description of a vocabulary is as lacking as any reference to the living  plenitude of experience We shall not return to the state anterior to discourse  in which nothing has yet been said and in  which things are only just beginning to emerge out of the grey light and we shall not pass beyond discourse in order to  rediscover the forms that it has created and left behind it we shall remain or try to remain at the level of discourse itself  Since it is sometimes necessary to dot the is of even the most obvious absences I will say that in all these searches in  which I have still progressed so little I would like to show that discourses in the form in which they can he heard or  read are not as one might expect a mere intersection of things and words an        54       obscure web of things and a manifest visible coloured chain of words I would like to show that discourse is not a  slender surface of contact or confrontation between a reality and a language longue the intrication of a lexicon and an  experience I would like to show with precise examples that in analysing discourses themselves one sees the loosening of  the embrace apparently so tight of words and things and the emergence of a group of rules proper to discursive practice  These rules define not the dumb existence of a reality nor the canonical use of a vocabulary but the ordering of objects  Words and things is the entirely serious title of a problem it is the ironic title of a work that modifies its own form  displaces its own data and reveals at the end of the day a quite different task A task that consists of not  of no longer   treating discourses as groups of signs signifying elements referring to contents or representations but as practices that  systematically form the objects of which they speak Of course discourses are composed of signs but what they do is  more than use these signs to designate things It is this more that renders them irreducible to the language longue and to  speech It is this more that we must reveal and describe      55   4 THE FORMATION OF  ENUNCIATIVE MODALITIES   Qualitative descriptions biographical accounts the location interpretation and crosschecking of signs reasonings by  analogy deduction statistical calculations experimental verifications and many other forms of statement are to be found  in the discourse of nineteenthcentury doctors What is it that links them together What necessity binds them together  Why these and not others Before attempting an answer to such questions we must first discover the law operating  behind all these diverse statements and the place from which they come     a First question who is speaking Who among the totality of speaking individuals is accorded the right to use this  sort of language langage Who is qualified to do so Who derives from it his own special quality his prestige and from  whom in return does he receive if not the assurance at least the presumption that what he says is true What is the status  of the individuals who  alone  have the right sanctioned by law or tradition juridically defined or spontaneously  accepted to proffer such a discourse The status of doctor involves criteria of competence and knowledge institutions  systems        56  pedagogic norms legal conditions that give the right  though not without laying down certain limitations  to practise  and to extend ones knowledge It also involves a system of differentiation and relations the division of attributions  hierarchical subordination functional complementarity the request for and the provision and exchange of information  with other individuals or other groups that also possess their own status with the state and its representatives with the     judiciary with different professional bodies with religious groups and at times with priests It also involves a number  of characteristics that define its functioning in relation to society as a whole the role that is attributed to the doctor  according to whether he is consulted by a private person or summoned more or less under compulsion by society  according to whether he practises a profession or carries out a function the right to intervene or make decisions that is  accorded him in these different cases what is required of him as the supervisor guardian and guarantor of the health of a  population a group a family an individual the payment that he receives from the community or from individuals the  form of contract explicit or implicit that he negotiates either with the group in which he practises or with the authority  that entrusts him with a task or with the patient who requests advice treatment or cure This status of the doctor is  generally a rather special one in all forms of society and civilization he is hardly ever an undifferentiated or  interchangeable person Medical statements cannot come from anybody their value efficacy even their therapeutic  powers and generally speaking their existence as medical statements cannot be dissociated from the statutorily defined  person who has the right to make them and to claim for them the power to overcome suffering and death But we also  know that this status in western civilization was profoundly modified at the end of the eighteenth century when the health  of the population became one of the economic norms required by industrial societies     b We must also describe the institutional sites from which the doctor makes his discourse and from which this  discourse derives its legitimate source and point of application its specific objects and instruments of verification In our  societies these sites are the hospital a place of constant coded systematic observation run by a         57   differentiated and hierarchized medical staff thus constituting a quantifiable field of frequencies private practice which  offers a field of less systematic less complete and far less numerous observations but which sometimes facilitates  observations that are more farreaching in their effects with a better knowledge of the background and environment the  laboratory an autonomous place long distinct from the hospital where certain truths of a general kind concerning the  human body life disease lesions etc which provide certain elements of the diagnosis certain signs of the developing  condition certain criteria of cure and which makes therapeutic experiment possible lastly what might be called the  library or documentary field which includes not only the hooks and treatises traditionally recognized as valid but also  all the observations and casehistories published and transmitted and the mass of statistical information concerning the  social environment climate epidemics mortality rates the incidence of diseases the centres of contagion occupational  diseases that can be supplied to the doctor by public bodies by other doctors by sociologists and by geographers In this  respect too these various sites of medical discourse were profoundly modified in the nineteenth century the  importance of the document continues to increase proportionately diminishing the authority of the book or tradition the  hospital which had been merely a subsidiary site for discourse on diseases and which took second place in importance  and value to private practice in which diseases left in their natural environment were in the eighteenth century to reveal  themselves in their vegetal truth then becomes the site of systematic homogeneous observations largescale  confrontations the establishment of frequencies and probabilities the annulation of individual variants in short the site  of the appearance of disease not as a particular species deploying its essential features beneath the doctors gaze but as  an average process with its significant guidelines boundaries and potential development Similarly it was in the  nineteenth century that daily medical practice integrated the laboratory as the site of a discourse that has the same  experimental norms as physics chemistry or biology     c The positions of the subject are also defined by the situation that it is possible for him to occupy in relation to the  various domains or        58  groups of objects according to a certain grid of explicit or implicit interrogations he is the questioning subject and  according to a certain programme of information he is the listening subject according to a table of characteristic  features he is the seeing subject and according to a descriptive type the observing subject he is situated at an optimal  perceptual distance whose boundaries delimit the wheat of relevant information he uses instrumental intermediaries that  modify the scale of the information shift the subject in relation to the average or immediate perceptual level ensure his  movement from a superficial to a deep level make him circulate in the interior space of the body  from manifest  symptoms to the organs from the organs to the tissues and finally from the tissues to the cells To these perceptual  situations should be added the positions that the subject can occupy in the information networks in theoretical teaching  or in hospital training in the system of oral communication or of written document as emitter and receiver of  observations casehistories statistical data general theoretical propositions projects and decisions The various  situations that the subject of medical discourse may occupy were redefined at the beginning of the nineteenth century     with the organization of a quite different perceptual field arranged in depth manifested by successive recourse to  instruments deployed by surgical techniques or methods of autopsy centred upon lesional sites and with the  establishment of new systems of registration notation description classification integration in numerical series and in  statistics with the introduction of new forms of teaching the circulation of information relations with other theoretical  domains sciences or philosophy and with other institutions whether administrative political or economic     If in clinical discourse the doctor is in turn the sovereign direct questioner the observing eye the touching finger  the organ that deciphers signs the point at which previously formulated descriptions are integrated the laboratory  technician it is because a whole group of relations is involved Relations between the hospital space as a place of  assistance of purified systematic observation and of partially proved partially experimental therapeutics and a whole  group of perceptual codes of the human body  as it is defined by morbid anatomy relations between the field of  immediate observations and the domain        59  of acquired information relations between the doctors therapeutic role his pedagogic role his role as an intermediary in  the diffusion of medical knowledge and his role as a responsible representative of public health in the social space  Understood as a renewal of points of view contents the forms and even the style of description the use of inductive or  probabilistic reasoning types of attribution of causality in short as a renewal of the modalities of enunciation clinical  medicine must not be regarded as the result of a new technique of observation  that of autopsy which was practised  long before the advent of the nineteenth century nor as the result of the search for pathogenic causes in the depths of the  organism  Morgagni was engaged in such a search in the middle of the eighteenth century nor as the effect of that  new institution the teaching hospital  such institutions had already been in existence for some decades in Austria and  Italy nor as the result of the introduction of the concept of tissue in Bichats Traite des membranes But as the  establishment of a relation in medical discourse between a number of distinct elements some of which concerned the  status of doctors others the institutional and technical site form which they spoke others their position as subjects  perceiving observing describing teaching etc It can be said that this relation between different elements some of  which are new while others were already in existence is effected by clinical discourse it is this as a practice that  establishes between them all a system of relations that is not really given or constituted a priori and if there is a unity  if the modalities of enunciation that it uses or to which it gives place are not simply juxtaposed by a series of historical  contingencies it is because it makes constant use of this group of relations   One further remark Having noted the disparity of the types of enunciation in clinical discourse I have not tried to  reduce it by uncovering the formal structures categories modes of logical succession types of reasoning and induction  forms of analysis and synthesis that may have operated in a discourse I did not wish to reveal the rational organization  that may provide statements like those of medicine with their element of intrinsic necessity Nor did I wish to reduce to a  single founding act or to a founding consciousness the general horizon of rationality against which the progress of  medicine gradually emerged its efforts to model itself upon the exact sciences the        60  contraction of its methods of observation the slow difficult expulsion of the images or fantasies that inhabit it the  purification of its system of reasoning Lastly I have not tried to describe the empirical genesis nor the various  component elements of the medical mentality how this shift of interest on the part of the doctors came about by what  theoretical or experimental model they were influenced what philosophy or moral thematics defined the climate of their  reflexion to what questions to what demands they had to reply what efforts were required of them to free themselves  from traditional prejudices by what ways they were led towards a unification and coherence that were never achieved  never reached by their knowledge In short I do not refer the various enunciative modalities to the unity of the subject   whether it concerns the subject regarded as the pure founding authority of rationality or the subject regarded as an  empirical function of synthesis Neither the knowing le connaitre nor the knowledge les connaissances   In the proposed analysis instead of referring back to the synthesis or the unifying function of a subject the various  enunciative modalities manifest his dispersion To the various statuses the various sites the various sites the various  positions that he can occupy or be given when making a discourse To the discontinuity of the planes from which he  speaks And if these planes are linked by a system of relations this system is not established by the synthetic activity of a  consciousness identical with itself dumb and anterior to all speech but by the specificity of a discursive practice I shall  abandon any attempt therefore to see discourse as a phenomenon of expression  the verbal translation of a previously  established synthesis instead I shall look for a field of regularity for various positions of subjectivity Thus conceived  discourse is not the majestically unfolding manifestation of a thinking knowing speaking subject but on the contrary a  totality in which the dispersion of the subject and his discontinuity with himself may be determined It is a space of  exteriority in which a network of distinct sites is deployed I showed earlier that it was neither by words nor by things  that the regulation of the objects proper to a discursive           footnote  In this respect the term regard medical used in my Naissance de In Clinique was not a very happy one   61       formation should be defined similarly it must now be recognized that it is neither by recourse to a transcendental subject  nor by recourse to a psychological subjectivity that the regulation of its enunciations should be defined    62   5 THE FORMATION OF CONCEPTS  Perhaps the family of concepts that emerges in the work of Linnaeus hut also in that of Ricardo and in the Grammaire  de PortRoyal may be organized into a coherent whole Perhaps one might be able to restore the deductive architecture  that it forms In any case the experiment is worth attempting  and it has been attempted several times On the other  hand if one takes a broader scale and chooses as guidelines such disciplines as grammar or economics or the study of  living beings the set of concepts that emerges does not obey such rigorous conditions their history is not the stoneby stone construction of an edifice Should this dispersion be left in its apparent disorder Or should it be seen as a  succession of conceptual systems each possessing its own organization and being articulated only against the perman ence of problems the continuity of tradition or the mechanism of influences Could a law not be found that would  account for the successive or simultaneous emergence of disparate concepts Could a system of occurrence not be found  between them that was not a logical systematicity Rather than wishing to replace concepts in a virtual deductive edifice  one would have to describe the organization of the field of statements where they appeared and circulated   63     a This organization involves firstly forms of succession And among them the various orderings of enunciative  series whether the order of inferences successive implications and demonstrative reasonings or the order of  descriptions the schemata of generalization or progressive specification to which they are subject the spatial  distributions that they cover or the order of the descriptive accounts and the way in which the events of the time are  distributed in the linear succession of the statements the various types of dependence of the statements which are not  always either identical or superposable on the manifest successions of the series of statements this is the case in the  dependences of hypothesisverification assertioncritique general lawparticular application the various rhetorical  schemata according to which groups of statements may he combined how descriptions deductions definitions whose  succession characterizes the architecture of a text are linked together Take for example the case of Natural History in  the Classical period it does not use the same concepts as in the sixteenth century certain of the older concepts genus  species signs are used in different ways new concepts like that of structure appear and others like that of organism  are formed later But what was altered in the seventeenth century and was to govern the appearance and recurrence of  concepts for the whole of Natural History was the general arrangement of the statements their successive arrangement  in particular wholes it was the way in which one wrote down what one observed and by means of a series of statements  recreated a perceptual process it was the relation and interplay of subordinations between describing articulating into  distinctive features characterizing and classifying it was the reciprocal position of particular observations and general  principles it was the system of dependence between what one learnt what one saw what one deduced what one  accepted as probable and what one postulated In the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries Natural History was not  simply a form of knowledge that gave a new definition to concepts like genus or character and which introduced new  concepts like that of natural classification or mammal above all it was a set of rules for arranging statements in series  an obligatory set of schemata of dependence of order and of successions in which the recurrent elements that may have  value as concepts were distributed         64   b The configuration of the enunciative field also involves forms of coexistence These outline first a field of  presence by which is understood all statements formulated elsewhere and taken up in a discourse acknowledged to be  truthful involving exact description wellfounded reasoning or necessary presupposition we must also give our  attention to those that are criticized discussed and judged as well as those that are rejected or excluded in this field of  presence the relations established may be of the order of experimental verification logical validation mere repetition  acceptance justified by tradition and authority commentary a search for hidden meanings the analysis of error these  relations may be explicit and sometimes formulated in types of specialized statements references critical discussions  or implicit and present in ordinary statements Again it is easy to see that the field of presence of Natural History in the  Classical period does not obey the same forms or the same criteria of choice or the same principles of exclusion as in  the period when Aldrovandi was collecting in one and the same text everything that had been seen observed recounted  passed on innumerable times by word of mouth and even imagined by the poets on the subject of monsters Distinct  from this field of presence one may also describe a field of concomitance this includes statements that concern quite  different domains of objects and belong to quite different domains of objects and belong to quite different types of  discourse but which are active among the statements studied here either because they serve as analogical confirmation  or because they serve as a general principle and as premises accepted by a reasoning or because they serve as models  that can be transferred to other contents or because they function as a higher authority than that to which at least certain  propositions are presented and subjected thus the field of concomitance of the Natural History of the period of  Linnaeus and Buffon is defined by a number of relations with cosmology the history of the earth philosophy theology  scripture and biblical exegesis mathematics in the very general form of a science of order and all these relations  distinguish it from both the discourse of the sixteenthcentury naturalists and that of the nineteenthcentury biologists  Lastly the enunciative field involves what might be called a field of memory statements that are no longer accepted or  discussed and which consequently no longer define either a body of truth or a domain of        65  validity but in relation to which relations of filiation genesis transformation continuity and historical discontinuity  can be established thus the field of memory of Natural History since Tournefort seems particularly restricted and  impoverished in its forms when compared with the broad cumulative and very specific field of memory possessed by  nineteenth and twentiethcentury biology on the other hand it seems much better defined and better articulated than the  field of memory surrounding the history of plants and animals in the Renaissance for at that time it could scarcely be  distinguished from the field of presence they had the same extension and the same form and involved the same relations     c Lastly we may define the procedures of intervention that may be legitimately applied to statements These  procedures are not in fact the same for all discursive formations those that are used to the exclusion of all others the  relations that link them and the unity thus created make it possible to specify each one These procedures may appear in  techniques of rewriting like those for example that enabled the naturalists of the Classical period to rewrite linear  descriptions in classificatory tables that have neither the same laws nor the same configuration as the lists and groups of  kinship established in the Middle Ages and during the Renaissance in methods of transcribing statements articulated in  the natural language according to a more or less formalized and artificial language the project and to a certain extent  the realization of such a language is to be found in Linnaeus and Adanson the modes of translating quantitative  statements into qualitative formulations and vice versa the establishment of relations between purely perceptual  measurements and descriptions the means used to increase the approximation of statements and to refine their exactitude  structural analysis according to the form number arrangement and size of the elements has made it possible since  Tournefort to achieve a closer and above all more constant approximation of descriptive statements the way in which  one delimits once again  by extension or restriction  the domain of validity of statements the enunciation of  structural characters was restricted in the period between Tournefort and Linnaeus then enlarged in that between Buffon  and Jussieu the way in which one transfers a type of        66   statement from one field of application to another like the transference from vegetal characterization to animal  taxonomy or from the description of superficial characters to the internal elements of the organism the methods of  systematizing propositions that already exist because they have been previously formulated but in a separated state or  again the methods of redistributing statements that are already linked together but which one rearranges in a new  systematic whole as Adanson takes up the natural characterizations that had been made before either by himself or by  others and placed them in a group of artificial descriptions the schema of which he had previously worked out on the  basis of some abstract combinatory     These elements that I am proposing to analyse are of rather different kinds Some constitute rules of formal  construction others rhetorical practices some define the internal configuration of a text others the modes of relation and  interference between different texts some are characteristic of a particular period others have a distant origin and far reaching chronological import But what properly belongs to a discursive formation and what makes it possible to delimit  the group of concepts disparate as they may be that are specific to it is the way in which these different elements are  related to one another the way in which for example the ordering of descriptions or accounts is linked to the techniques  of rewriting the way in which the field of memory is linked to the forms of hierarchy and subordination that govern the  statements of a text the way in which the modes of approximation and development of the statements are linked to the  modes of criticism commentary and interpretation of previously formulated statements etc It is this group of relations  that constitutes a system of conceptual formation   The description of such a system could not be valid for a direct immediate description of the concepts themselves My  intention is not to carry out an exhaustive observation of them to establish the characteristics that they may have in  common to undertake a classification of them to measure their internal coherence or to test their mutual compatibility I  do not wish to take as an object of analysis the conceptual architecture of an isolated text an individual oeuvre or a  science at a particular moment in time One stands back in relation to this manifest           67   set of concepts and one tries to determine according to what schemata of series simultaneous groupings linear or  reciprocal modification the statements may be linked to one another in a type of discourse one tries in this way to  discover how the recurrent elements of statements can reappear dissociate recompose gain in extension or determin ation be taken up into new logical structures acquire on the other hand new semantic contents and constitute partial  organizations among themselves These schemata make it possible to describe  not the laws of the internal construction  of concepts not their progressive and individual genesis in the mind of man  but their anonymous dispersion through  texts hooks and oeuvres A dispersion that characterizes a type of discourse and which defines between concepts forms  of deduction derivation and coherence but also of incompatibility intersection substitution exclusion mutual  alteration displacement etc Such an analysis then concerns at a kind of preconceptual level the field in which     concepts can coexist and the rules to which this field is subjected  In order to define more precisely what I mean by preconceptual I shall take the example of the four theoretical   schemata studied in my book The Order of Things and which characterize General Grammar in the seventeenth and  eighteenth centuries These four schemata  attribution articulation designation and dervation  do not designate con cepts that were in fact used by the Classical grammarians nor do they make it possible to reconstitute over and above  different grammatical works a sort of more general more abstract more impoverished system but discover by that very  fact the profound compatibility of these different apparently opposed systems They make it possible to describe     1 How the different grammatical analyses can be ordered and deployed and what forms of succession are possible  between analyses of the noun analyses of the verb and analyses of the adjective those that concern phonetics and those  that concern syntax those that concern the original language longue and those that project an artificial language  longue These different orders are laid down by the relations of dependence that may be observed between the theories  of attribution articulation designation and derivation        68   2How General Grammar defines a domain of validity for itself according to what criteria one may discuss the  truth or falsehood of a proposition how it constitutes a domain of normativity for itself according to what criteria  one may exclude certain statements as being irrelevant to the discourse or as inessential and marginal or as non scientific how it constitutes a domain of actuality for itself comprising acquired solutions defining present  problems situating concepts and affirmations that have fallen into disuse     3What relations General Grammar has with Mathesis with Cartesian and postCartesian algebra with the project   of a general science of order with the philosophical analysis of representation and the theory of signs with Natural  History the problems of characterization and taxonomy with the Analysis of Wealth and the problems of the  arbitrary signs of measurement and exchange by marking out these relations one may determine the ways by which  the circulation the transfer and the modification of concepts the alteration of their form or changes in their field of  application are made possible between one domain and another The network formed by the four theoretical  segments does not define the logical architecture of all the concepts used by grammarians it outlines the regular  space of their formation     4How the various conceptions of the verb to be of the copula of the verbal radical and the flexional ending for   a theoretical schema of attribution were simultaneously or successively possible under the form of alternative  choice modification or substitution the various conceptions of the phonetic elements of the alphabet of the name  of substantives and adjectives for a theoretical schema of articulation the various concepts of proper noun and  common noun demonstrative nominal root syllable or expressive sonority for the theoretical segment of  designation the various concepts of original and derived language langage metaphor and figure poetic language  langage for the theoretical segment of derivation     The preconceptual level that we have uncovered refers neither to a horizon of ideality nor to an empirical genesis of  abstractions On the one hand it is not a horizon of ideality placed discovered or        69  established by a founding gesture  and one that is so original that it eludes all chronological insertion it is not an  inexhaustible a priori at the confines of history set back both because it eludes all beginning all genetic restitution and  because it could never he contemporary with itself in an explicit totality In fact one does not pose the question at the  level of discourse itself which is not external translation but the locus of emergence of concepts one does not attach the  constants of discourse to the ideal structures of the concept but one describes the conceptual network on the basis of the  intrinsic regularities of discourse one does not subject the multiplicity of statements to the coherence of concepts and  this coherence to the silent recollection of a metahistorical ideality one establishes the inverse series one replaces the  pure aims of noncontradiction in a complex network of conceptual compatibility and incompatibility and one relates this  complexity to the rules that characterize a particular discursive practice By that very fact it is no longer necessary to     appeal to the themes of an endlessly withdrawing origin and and inexhaustible horizon the organization of a group of  rules in the practice of discourse even if it does not constitute an event so easy to situate as a formulation or a discovery  may he determined however in the element of history and if it is inexhaustible it is by that very fact that the perfectly  describable system that it constitutes takes account of a very considerable set of concepts and a very large number of  transformations that affect both these concepts and their relations Instead of outlining a horizon that rises from the depths  of history and maintains itself through history the preconceptual thus described is on the contrary at the most  superficial level at the level of discourse the group of rules that in fact operate within it   Nor is it a genesis of abstractions trying to rediscover the series of operations that have made it possible to constitute  them overall intuitions discoveries of particular cases the disconnexion of imaginary themes the encountering of  theoretical or technical obstacles successive borrowings from traditional models definition of the adequate formal  structure etc In the analysis proposed here the rules of formation operate not only in the mind or consciousness of  individuals but in discourse itself they operate therefore according to a sort of uniform anonymity on all individuals  who undertake to speak in this        70   discursive field On the other hand one does not suppose them to be universally valid for every domain one always  describes them in particular discursive fields and one does not accord them at the outset indefinite possibilities of  extension The most one can do is to make a systematic comparison from one region to another of the rules for the  formation of concepts it is in this way that I have tried to uncover the identities and differences that may be presented  by these groups of rules in the General Grammar the Natural History and the Analysis of Wealth of the Classical  period These groups of rules are specific enough in each of these domains to characterize a particular well individualized discursive formation but they offer enough analogies for us to see these various formations form a wider  discursive grouping at a higher level In any case the rules governing the formation of concepts however generalized  the concepts may be are not the result laid down in history and deposited in the depth of collective customs of  operations carried out by individuals they do not constitute the bare schema of a whole obscure work in the course of  which concepts would be made to emerge through illusions prejudices errors and traditions The preconceptual field  allows the emergence of the discursive regularities and constraints that have made possible the heterogeneous  multiplicity of concepts and beyond these the profusion of the themes beliefs and representations with which one  usually deals when one is writing the history of ideas   In order to analyse the rules for the formation of objects one must neither as we have seen embody them in things  nor relate them to the domain of words in order to analyse the formation of enunciative types one must relate them  neither to the knowing subject nor to a psychological individuality Similarly to analyse the formation of concepts one  must relate them neither to the horizon of ideality nor to the empirical progress of ideas   6 THE FORMATION OF STRATEGIES   Such discourses as economics medicine grammar the science of living beings give rise to certain organizations of  concepts certain regroupings of objects certain types of enunciation which form according to their degree of coherence  rigour and stability themes or theories the theme in eighteenthcentury grammar of an original language longue from  which all others derive and of which all others carry within themselves a sometimes decipherable memory a theory in  nineteenthcentury philology of a kinship between all the IndoEuropean languages and of an archaic idiom that served  as a common startingpoint a theme in the eighteenth century of an evolution of the species deploying in time the  continuity of nature and explaining the present gaps in the taxonomic table a theory propounded by the Physiocrats of a  circulation of wealth on the basis of agricultural production Whatever their formal level may be I shall call these themes     and theories strategies The problem is to discover how they are distributed in history Is it necessity that links them  together makes them invisible calls them to their right places one after another and makes of them successive solutions  to one and the same problem Or chance encounters between ideas of different origin influences discoveries     72   speculative climates theoretical models that the patience or genius of individuals arranges into more or less well constituted wholes Or can one find a regularity between them and define the common system of their formation   As for the analysis of these strategies I can hardly enter into great detail The reason is simple enough in the various  discursive domains which I have tried to sketch out  rather hesitantly no doubt and especially at the beginning with  inadequate methodological control  the problem was to describe in each case the discursive formation in all its  dimensions and according to its own characteristics it was necessary therefore to describe each time the rules for the  formation of objects modalities of statement concepts and theoretical choices But it turned out that the difficult point  of the analysis and the one that demanded greatest attention was not the same in each case In Madness and  Civilization I was dealing with a discursive formation whose theoretical points of choice were fairly easy to locate  whose conceptual systems were relatively uncomplex and few in number and whose enunciative rules were fairly  homogeneous and repetitive on the other hand the problem lay in the emergence of a whole group of highly complex  interwoven objects it was necessary above all to describe the formation of these objects in order to locate in its  specificity the whole of psychiatric discourse In Naissance de la clinique the essential point of the research was the way  in which at the end of the eighteenth and the beginning of the nineteenth century the enunciative forms of medical  discourse had been modified the analysis was concerned therefore less with the formation of conceptual systems or the  formation of theoretical choices than with the status the institutional siting the situation and the modes of insertion  used by the discoursing subject Lastly in The Order of Things my attention was concentrated mainly on the networks  of concepts and their rules of formation identical or different as they could be located in General Grammar Natural  History and the Analysis of Wealth The place and the implications of the strategic choices were indicated whether  for example in the case of Linnaeus and Buffon or the Physiocrats and the Utilitarists but I did little more than locate  them and my analysis scarcely touched on their formation Let us say that a fuller analysis of theoretical choices        73  must be left until a later study in which I shall be able to give it my whole attention   For the moment the most that I can do is to indicate the directions in which the research will proceed These might be  summarized thus     I  Determine the possible points of diffraction of discourse These points are characterized in the first instance as  points of incompatibility two objects or two types of enunciation or two concepts may appear in the same discursive  formation without being able to enter  under pain of manifest contradiction or inconsequence  the same series of  statements They are then characterized as points of equivalence the two incompatible elements are formed in the same  way and on the basis of the same rules the conditions of their appearance are identical they are situated at the same  level and instead of constituting a mere defect of coherence they form an alternative even if chronologically speaking  they do not appear at the same time even if they do not have the same importance and if they were not equally  represented in the population of effective statements they appear in the form of either    or Lastly they are  characterized as link points of systematization on the basis of each of these equivalent yet incompatible elements a  coherent series of objects forms of statement and concepts has been derived with in each series possible new points of  incompatibility In other words the dispersions studied at previous levels do not simply constitute gaps nonidentities  discontinuous series they come to form discursive subgroups  those very subgroups that are usually regarded as  being of major importance as if they were the immediate unity and raw material out of which larger discursive groups  theories conceptions themes are formed For example one does not consider in an analysis of this kind that the  Analysis of Wealth in the eighteenth century was the result by way of simultaneous composition or chronological  succession of several different conceptions of coinage of the exchange of objects of need of the formation of value and  prices or of ground rent one does not consider that it is made up of the ideas of Cantillon taking up from those of Petty  of Laws experience reflected by various theoreticians in turn and of the Physiocratic system opposing Utilitarist  conceptions One describes it rather as a unity of distribution that opens a field of possible options and enables        74   various mutually exclusive architectures to appear side by side or in turn       2 But all the possible alternatives are not in fact realized there are a good many partial groups regional  compatibilities and coherent architectures that might have emerged yet did not do so In order to account for the choices  that were made out of all those that could have been made and those alone one must describe the specific authorities  that guided ones choice Well to the fore is the role played by the discourse being studied in relation to those that are  contemporary with it or related to it One must study therefore the economy of the discursive constellation to which it  belongs It may in fact play the role of a formal system of which other discourses are applications with various semantic  fields it may on the other hand he that of a concrete model that must be applied to other discourses at a higher level of  abstraction thus General Grammar in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries appears as a particular model of the  general theory of signs and representation The discourse under study may also be in a relation of analogy opposition or  complementarity with certain other discourses there is for example a relation of analogy in the Classical period  between the Analysis of Wealth and Natural History the first is to the representation of need and desire what the second  is to the representation of perceptions and judgements one may also note that Natural History and General Grammar are  opposed to one another in the same way as a theory of natural characters and a theory of conventional signs both in turn  are opposed to the Analysis of Wealth just as the study of qualitative signs is opposed to that of the quantitative signs of  measurement each in fact develops one of the three complementary roles of the representative sign designation  classification exchange Lastly one may describe between several discourses relations of mutual delimitation each  giving the other the distinctive marks of its singularity by the differentiation of its domain of application as in the case of  psychiatry and organic medicine which were virtually not distinguished from one another before the end of the eighteenth  century and which established from that moment a gap that has since characterized them This whole group of relations  forms a principle of determination that permits or excludes within a given discourse a   75  certain number of statements these are conceptual systematizations enunciative series groups and organizations of  objects that might have been possible and of which nothing can justify the absence at the level of their own rules of  formation but which are excluded by a discursive constellation at a higher level and in a broader space A discursive  formation does not occupy therefore all the possible volume that is opened up to it of right by the systems of formation  of its objects its enunciations and its concepts it is essentially incomplete owing to the system of formation of its  strategic choices Hence the fact that taken up again placed and interpreted in a new constellation a given discursive  formation may reveal new possibilities thus in the present distribution of scientific discourses the Grammar of Port Royal or the taxonomy of Linnaeus may free elements that in relation to them are both intrinsic and new but we are  not dealing with a silent content that has remained implicit that has been said and yet not said and which constitutes  beneath manifest statements a sort of subdiscourse that is more fundamental and which is now emerging at last into the  light of day what we are dealing with is a modification in the principle of exclusion and the principle of the possibility  of choices a modification that is due to an insertion in a new discursive constellation     3 The determination of the theoretical choices that were actually made is also dependent upon another authority This  authority is characterized first by the function that the discourse under study must carry out in a field of nondiscursive  practices Thus General Grammar played a role in pedagogic practice in a much more obvious and much more  important way the Analysis of Wealth played a role not only in the political and economic decisions of governments  but in the scarcely conceptualized scarcely theoretized daily practice of emergent capitalism and in the social and  political struggles that characterized the Classical period This authority also involves the rules and processes of  appropriation of discourse for in our societies and no doubt in many others the property of discourse  in the sense of  the right to speak ability to understand licit and immediate access to the corpus of already formulated statements and  the capacity to invest this discourse in decisions institutions or practices  is in fact confined sometimes        76  with the addition of legal sanctions to a particular group of individuals in the bourgeois societies that we have known  since the sixteenth century economic discourse has never been a common discourse no more than medical or literary  discourse though in a different way Lastly this authority is characterized by the possible positions of desire in relation  to discourse discourse may in fact be the place for a phantasmatic representation an element of symbolization a form of  the forbidden an instrument of derived satisfaction this possibility of being in relation with desire is not simply the fact  of the poetic fictional or imaginary practice of discourse the discourses on wealth on language langage on nature on  madness on life and death and many others perhaps that are much more abstract may occupy very specific positions in  relation to desire In any case the analysis of this authority must show that neither the relation of discourse to desire nor  the processes of its appropriation nor its role among nondiscursive practices is extrinsic to its unity its characterization  and the laws of its formation They are not disturbing elements which superposing themselves upon its pure neutral  atemporal silent form suppress its true voice and emit in its place a travestied discourse but on the contrary its     formative elements     A discursive formation will be individualized if one can define the system of formation of the different strategies that  are deployed in it in other words if one can show how they all derive in spite of their sometimes extreme diversity and  in spite of their dispersion in time from the same set of relations For example the Analysis of Wealth in the seventeenth  and eighteenth centuries is characterized by the system that could form both Colberts mercantilism and Cantillons neo mercantilism Laws strategy and that of ParisDuverney the Physiocratic option and the Utilitarist option And one will  have defined this system if one can describe how the points of diffraction of economic discourse derive from one another  regulate one another and are involved with one another how a point of choice about prices derives from a decision about  the concept of value how the choices made depend on the general constellation in which economic discourse figures  the choice in favour of coinagesign is linked to the place occupied by the Analysis of Wealth beside the theory of  language langage the        77  analysis of representations mathesis and the science of order  how these choices are linked to the function carried out  by economic discourse in the practice of emergent capitalism the process of appropriation of which it is the object on  the part of the bourgeoisie the role that it can play in the realization of interests and desires Economic discourse in the  Classical period is defined by a certain constant way of relating possibilities of systematization interior to a discourse  other discourses that are exterior to it and a whole nondiscursive field of practices appropriation interests and desires   It should be noted that the strategies thus described are not rooted anterior to discourse in the silent depths of a choice  that is both preliminary and fundamental All these groups of discourses that are to be described are not the expression of  a worldview that has been coined in the form of words nor the hypocritical translation of an interest masquerading under  the pretext of a theory the Natural History of the Classical period is more than a confrontation in the limbo that  precedes manifest history between a Linnaean view of a static ordered compartmented universe that is subjected from  its very beginnings to the classificatory table and the still confused perception of a nature that is the heir to time with all  the weight of its accidents and open to the possibility of an evolution similarly the Analysis of Wealth is more than the  conflict of interest between a bourgeoisie that has become a landowning class expressing its economic or political  demands through the Physiocrats and a commercial bourgeoisie that demands protectionist or liberal measures through  the Utilitarists Neither the Analysis of Wealth nor Natural History if one questions them at the level of their existence  their unity their permanence and their transformations may be regarded as the sum of these various options On the  contrary these options must be described as systematically different ways of treating objects of discourse of delimiting  them regrouping or separating them linking them together and making them derive from one another of arranging  forms of enunciation of choosing them placing them constituting series composing them into great rhetorical unities  of manipulating concepts of giving them rules for their use inserting them into regional coherences and thus  constituting conceptual architectures These options are not seeds of discourse in which discourses are determined in  advance and        78  prefigured in a quasimicroscopic form they are regulated ways and describable as such of practising the possibilities  of discourse   But these strategies must not be analysed either as secondary elements that are superposed on a discursive rationality  that is of right independent of them There is not or at least as far as the historical description whose possibility we are  tracing here is concerned a sort of ideal discourse that is both ultimate and timeless and which choices extrinsic in  origin have perverted disturbed suppressed or thrust towards a possibly distant future one must not suppose for  example that it holds on nature or on the economy two superposed and intermingled discourses one that proceeds slowly  accumulating its acquisitions and gradually achieving completion a true discourse but one that exists in its pure state  only at the teleological confines of history the other forever disintegrating recommenced in perpetual rupture with  itself composed of heterogeneous fragments a discourse of opinion that history in the course of time throws back into  the past There is no natural taxonomy that has been exact fixism excepted there is no economy of exchange and use  that has been true without the preferences and illusions of a mercantile bourgeoisie Classical taxonomy or the Analysis  of Wealth in the form in which they actually existed and constituted historical figures involve in an articulated but  indissociable system objects statements concepts and theoretical choices And just as one must not relate the formation  of objects either to words or to things nor that of statements either to the pure form of knowledge or to the psychological  subject nor that of concepts either to the structure of ideality or to the succession of ideas one must not relate the  formation of theoretical choices either to a fundamental project or to the secondary play of opinions          7 REMARKS AND CONSEQUENCES   We must now take up once more a number of remarks to be found in the preceding analyses reply to some of the  questions that they inevitably raise and above all examine the objection that threatens to present itself for the paradox of  the enterprise is now apparent   At the outset I questioned those preestablished unities according to which one has traditionally divided up the  indefinite repetitive prolific domain of discourse My intention was not to deny all value to these unities or to try to  forbid their use it was to show that they required in order to be defined exactly a theoretical elaboration However   and it is here that all the preceding analyses appear so problematic  was it necessary to superpose upon these unities  which may in fact have been rather uncertain another category of less visible more abstract and certainly far more  problematical unities But in cases when their historical limits and the specificity of their organization are fairly easy to  perceive witness General Grammar or Natural History these discursive formations present far more difficult problems  of location than the book or the oeuvre Why then proceed to such dubious regroupings at the very moment when one is  challenging those that once seemed the most obvious What new domain is one hoping to        80   discover What hitherto obscure or implicit relations What transformations that have hitherto remained outside the  reach of historians In short what descriptive efficacy can one accord to these new analyses I shall try to answer all  these questions later But for the moment I must reply to a question that is primary in relation to these later analyses and  terminal in relation to the preceding ones on the question of the discursive formations that I have tried to define can one  really speak of unities Is the redivision that I am proposing capable of individualizing wholes And what is the nature  of the unity thus discovered or constructed   We set out with an observation with the unity of a discourse like that of clinical medicine or political economy or  Natural History we are dealing with a dispersion of elements This dispersion itself  with its gaps its discontinuities  its entanglements its incompatibilities its replacements and its substitutions  can be described in its uniqueness if one  is able to determine the specific rules in accordance with which its objects statements concepts and theoretical options  have been formed if there really is a unity it does not lie in the visible horizontal coherence of the elements formed it  resides well anterior to their formation in the system that makes possible and governs that formation But in what way  can we speak of unities and systems How can we affirm that we have properly individualized certain discursive groups  or wholes When in a highly random way we have uncovered behind the apparently irreducible multiplicity of objects  statements concepts and choices a mass of elements that were no less numerous or dispersed but which were  heterogeneous with one another When we have divided these elements into four distinct groups whose mode of  articulation has scarcely been defined And in what sense can one say that all these elements that have been uncovered  behind the objects statements concepts and strategies of discourses guarantee the existence of no less individualizable  wholes such as oeuvres or books     1 As we have seen  and there is probably no need to reiterate it  when one speaks of a system of formation one  does not only mean the juxtaposition coexistence or interaction of heterogeneous elements institutions techniques  social groups perceptual organizations relations between various discourses but also the relation that is           81     established between them  and in a well determined form  by discursive practice But what is to he done with those  four systems or rather those four groups of relations How can they all define a single system of formation   In fact the different levels thus defined are not independent of one another I have shown that the strategic choices do  not emerge directly from a worldview or from a predominance of interests peculiar to this or that speaking subject but  that their very possibility is determined by points of divergence in the group of concepts I have also shown that concepts  were not formed directly against the approximative confused and living background of ideas but on the basis of forms  of coexistence between statements and as we have seen the modalities of enunciation were described on the basis of the  position occupied by the subject in relation to the domain of objects of which he is speaking In this way there exists a  vertical system of dependences not all the positions of the subject all the types of coexistence between statements all the  discursive strategies are equally possible but only those authorized by anterior levels given for example the system of  formation that governed in the eighteenth century the objects of Natural History as individualities possessing  characters and therefore classifiable as structural elements capable of variation as visible analysable surfaces as a field  of continuous regular differences certain modalities of enunciation are excluded for example the decipherment of  signs others are implied for example description according to a particular code given too the different positions that  the discoursing subject may occupy as an observing subject with instrumental mediation as a subject selecting out of the  perceptual plurality only the elements of the structure as a subject transcribing these elements into a coded vocabulary  etc there are a number of coexistences between the statements that are excluded as for example the erudite reactiva tion of the alreadysaid or the exegetic commentary of a sacralized text others on the other hand that are possible or  required such as the integration of totally or partially analogous statements into a classificatory table The levels are not  free from one another therefore and are not deployed according to an unlimited autonomy between the primary  differentiation of objects and the formation of discursive strategies there exists a whole hierarchy of relations        82   But relations are also established in a reverse direction The lower levels are not independent of those above them  Theoretical choices exclude or imply in the statements in which they are made the formation of certain concepts that is  certain forms of coexistence between statements thus in the texts of the Physiocrats one will not find the same modes of  integrating quantitative data and measurements as in the analyses of the Utilitarists It is not that the Physiocratic option  can modify the group of rules that govern the formation of economic concepts in the eighteenth century but it can  implement some of these rules and exclude others and consequently reveal certain concepts like that for example of the  net product that appear nowhere else It is not the theoretical choice that governs the formation of the concept but the  choice has produced the concept by the mediation of specific rules for the formation of concepts and by the set of  relations that it holds with this level     2 These systems of formation must not be taken as blocks of immobility static forms that are imposed on discourse  from the outside and that define once and for all its characteristics and possibilities They are not constraints whose  origin is to be found in the thoughts of men or in the play of their representations but nor are they determinations which  formed at the level of institutions or social or economic relations transcribe themselves by force on the surface of  discourses These systems  I repeat  reside in discourse itself or rather since we are concerned not with its  interiority and what it may contain but with its specific existence and with its conditions on its frontier at that limit at  which the specific rules that enable it to exist as such are defined By system of formation then I mean a complex group  of relations that function as a rule it lays down what must be related in a particular discursive practice for such and such  an enunciation to be made for such and such a concept to be used for such and such a strategy to be organized To define  a system of formation in its specific individuality is therefore to characterize a discourse or a group of statements by the  regularity of a practice   As a group of rules for a discursive practice the system of formation is not a stranger to time It does not concentrate  everything that may appear through an ageold series of statements into an initial point that   83   is at the same time beginning origin foundation system of axioms and on the basis of which the events of real history  have merely to unfold in a quite necessary way What it outlines is the system of rules that must be put into operation if  such and such an object is to be transformed such and such a new enumeration appear such and such a concept he  developed whether metamorphosed or imported and such and such a strategy he modified  without ever ceasing to  belong to this same discourse and what it also outlines is the system of rules that has to be put into operation if a change  in other discourses in other practices in institutions in social relations and in economic processes is to be transcribed     within a given discourse thus constituting a new object giving rise to a new strategy giving place to new enunciations or  new concepts A discursive formation then does not play the role of a figure that arrests time and freezes it for decades  or centuries it determines a regularity proper to temporal processes it presents the principle of articulation between a  series of discursive events and other series of events transformations mutations and processes It is not an atemporal  form but a schema of correspondence between several temporal series   This mobility of the system of formation appears in two ways First at the level of the elements that are being related to  one another these in fact may undergo a number of intrinsic mutations that are integrated into discursive practice without  the general form of its regularity being altered thus throughout the nineteenth century criminal jurisprudence  demographic pressure the demand for labour the forms of public assistance the status and juridical conditions of  internment were continually changing yet the discursive practice of psychiatry continued to establish the same group of  relations between these elements in this way the system preserved the characteristics of its individuality through the  same laws of formation new objects appear new types of individuals new classes of behaviour are characterized as  pathological new modalities of enunciation are put into operation quantitative notations and statistical calculations  new concepts are outlined such as those of degeneracy perversion neurosis and of course new theoretical structures  can be built But inversely the discursive practices modify the domains that they relate to one another It is no use  establishing specific relations that can be analysed only at their        84  own level  the effect of these relations is not confined to discourse alone it is also felt in the elements that they  articulate upon one another The hospital field for example did not remain unaffected when clinical discourse was put  into relation with the laboratory the body of rules that governed its working the status accorded the hospital doctor the  function of his observation the level of analysis that can be carried out in it were necessarily modified     3 What are described as systems of formation do not constitute the terminal stage of discourse if by that term one  means the texts or words as they appear with their vocabulary syntax logical structure or rhetorical organization  Analysis remains anterior to this manifest level which is that of the completed construction in defining the principle of  distributing objects in a discourse it does not take into account all their connexions their delicate structure or their  internal subdivisions in seeking the law of the dispersion of concepts it does not take into account all the processes of  elaboration or all the deductive series in which they may figure if analysis studies the modalities of enunciation it  questions neither the style nor the succession of the sentences in short it leaves the final placing of the text in dotted  outline But we must be clear on one point if analysis stands back in relation to this final construction it is not to turn  away from the discourse and to appeal to the silent work of thought nor is it to turn away from the systematic and to  reveal the living disorder of attempts trials errors and new beginnings    In this respect the analysis of discursive formations is opposed to many customary descriptions One is used in fact to  consider that discourses and their systematic ordering are not only the ultimate state the final result of a long and often  sinuous development involving language longue and thought empirical experience and categories the lived and ideal  necessities the contingency of events and the play of formal constraints Behind the visible facade of the system one  posits the rich uncertainty of disorder and beneath the thin surface of discourse the whole mass of a largely silent  development devenir a presystematic that is not of the order of the system a prediscursive that belongs to an essential  silence Discourse and system produce each other  and          85  conjointly  only at the crest of this immense reserve What are being analysed here are certainly  not the terminal states of discourse they are the preterminal regularities in relation to which the  ultimate state far from constituting the birthplace of a system is defined by its variants Behind  the completed system what is discovered by the analysis of formations is not the bubbling source  of life itself life in an as yet uncaptured state it is an immense density of systematicities a tight  group of multiple relations Moreover these relations cannot be the very web of the text  they are  not by nature foreign to discourse They can certainly be qualified as prediscursive but only if one  admits that this prediscursive is still discursive that is that they do not specify a thought or a  consciousness or a group of representations which a posteriori and in a way that is never quite  necessary are transcribed into a discourse but that they characterize certain levels of discourse that  they define rules that are embodied as a particular practice by discourse One is not seeking  therefore to pass from the text to thought from talk to silence from the exterior to the interior  from spatial dispersion to the pure recollection of the moment from superficial multiplicity to  profound unity One remains within the dimension of discourse     Part III The Statement and the Archive    89       1 DEFINING THE STATEMENT  I suppose that by now we have accepted the risk that we are now willing in order to articulate the great surface of  discourse to posit the existence of those somewhat strange somewhat distant figures that I have called discursive  formations that we have put to one side not in a definitive way but for a time and out of methodological rigour the  traditional unities of the book and the ceuvre that we have ceased to accept as a principle of unity the laws of  constructing discourse with the formal organization that results or the situation of the speaking subject with the  context and the psychological nucleus that characterize it that we no longer relate discourse to the primary ground of  experience nor to the a priori authority of knowledge but that we seek the rules of its formation in discourse itself I  suppose that we have agreed to undertake these long inquiries into the system of emergence of objects the system of the  appearance and distribution of enunciative modes the system of the placing and dispersion of concepts the system of the  deployment of strategic choices I suppose that we are willing to construct such abstract problematic unities instead of  welcoming those that presented themselves as being more or less perceptually familiar if not as selfevident realities   But what in fact have I been speaking about so far What has been the object of my inquiry And what did I intend to  describe        90  Statements  both in that discontinuity that frees them from all the forms in which one was so ready to allow them to   be caught and in the general unlimited apparently formless field of discourse But I refrained from providing a  preliminary definition of the statement Nor did I try to construct one as I proceeded in order to justify the naivety of my  startingpoint Moreover  and this no doubt is the reason for so much unconcern  I wonder whether I have not  changed direction on the way whether I have not replaced my first quest with another whether while analysing objects  or concepts let alone strategies I was in fact still speaking of statements whether the four groups of rules by which I  characterized a discursive formation really did define groups of statements Lastly instead of gradually reducing the  rather fluctuating meaning of the word discourse I believe that I have in fact added to its meanings treating it  sometimes as the general domain of all statements sometimes as an individualizable group of statements and sometimes  as a regulated practice that accounts for a certain number of statements and have I not allowed this same word  discourse which should have served as a boundary around the term statement to vary as I shifted my analysis or its  point of application as the statement itself faded from view   This then is the task that now confronts me to take up the definition of the statement at its very root And to see  whether that definition really was present in my earlier descriptions to see whether I really was dealing with the  statement in my analysis of discursive formations   On several occasions I have used the term statement either to speak of a population of statements as if I were  dealing with individuals or isolated events or in order to distinguish it from the groups that I called discourses as the  part is distinguished from the whole At first sight the statement appears as an ultimate undecomposable element that  can be isolated and introduced into a set of relations with other similar elements A point without a surface but a point  that can be located in planes of division and in specific forms of groupings A seed that appears on the surface of a tissue  of which it is the constituent element The atom of discourse   And the problem soon arises if the statement really is the elementary unit of discourse what does it consist of What     are its distinctive       91  features What boundaries must one accord to it Is this unity identical with that to which logicians have given the term  proposition and that which grammarians call a sentence or that which analysts try to map by the term speech act  What place does it occupy among all those unities that the investigation of language langage has already revealed  Even though the theory of these unities is so often incomplete on account of the difficulty of the problems that they  present and the difficulty in many cases of delimiting them with any degree of rigour   I do not think that the necessary and sufficient condition of a statement is the presence of a defined propositional  structure or that one can speak of a statement only when there is a proposition In fact one can have two perfectly  distinct statements referring to quite different discursive groupings when one finds only one proposition possessing  only one value obeying only one group of laws for its construction and involving the same possibilities of use No one  heard and It is true that no one heard are indistinguishable from a logical point of view and cannot be regarded as two  different propositions But in so many statements these two formations are not equivalent or interchangeable They  cannot occupy the same place on the plane of discourse nor can they belong to exactly the same group of statements If  one finds the formulation No one heard in the first line of a novel we know until a new order emerges that it is an  observation made either by the author or by a character aloud or in the form of an interior monologue if one finds the  second formulation It is true that no one heard one can only be in a group of statements constituting an interior  monologue a silent discussion with oneself or a fragment of dialogue a group of questions and answers In each case  there is the same propositional structure but there are distinct enunciative characteristics There may on the other hand  be complex and doubled propositional forms or on the contrary fragmentary incomplete propositions when one is  quite obviously dealing with a simple complete autonomous statement even if it is part of group of other statements  the example The present king of France is bald is well known it can be analysed from a logical point of view only if  one accepts in the form of a single statement two distinct propositions each of which may be true or false on its own  account or again there is a        92  proposition like I am lying which can be true only in relation to an assertion on a lower level The criteria by which one  can define the identity of a proposition distinguish several of them beneath the unity of a formulation characterize its  autonomy or its completion are not valid when one comes to describe the particular unity of a statement   And what of the sentence Should we not accept an equivalence between sentence and statement Wherever there is a  grammatically isolable sentence one can recognize the existence of an independent statement but on the other hand one  cannot speak of statement when beneath the sentence itself one reaches the level of its constituents It would he pointless  to object against such an equivalence that some statements may be composed outside the canonical form of subject copulapredicate of a simple nominal syntagma That man or an adverb Absolutely or a personal pronoun You  For the grammarians themselves recognize such formulations as independent sentences even if those formulations have  been obtained through a series of transformations on the basis of the subjectpredicate schema Moreover they recognize  as acceptable sentences groups of linguistic elements that have not been correctly constructed providing they are  interpretable on the other hand they accord the status of grammatical sentences to interpretable groups on condition  however that they are correctly formed With so broad  and in a sense so lax  a definition of the sentence it is  difficult to see how one is to recognize sentences that are not statements or statements that are not sentences   Yet the equivalence is far from being a total one and it is relatively easy to cite statements that do not correspond to  the linguistic structure of sentences When one finds in a Latin grammar a series of words arranged in a column amo  amas amat one is dealing not with a sentence but with the statement of the different personal inflexions of the present  indicative of the verb amare One may find this example debatable one may say that it is a mere artifice of presentation  that this statement is an elliptical abbreviated sentence spatialized in a relatively unusual mode that should he read as  the sentence The present indicative of the verb amare is amo for the first person etc Other examples in any case are  less ambiguous a classificatory table of the botanical species is made up of statements not sentences Linnaeuss Genera  Plantarum is a whole book of statements in which one can recognize        93  only a small number of sentences a genealogical tree an accounts book the calculations of a trade balance are  statements where are the sentences One can go further an equation of the nth degree or the algebraic formula of the  law of refraction must be regarded as statements and although they possess a highly rigorous grammaticality since they     are made up of symbols whose meaning is determined by rules of usage and whose succession is governed by laws of  construction this grammaticality cannot be judged by the same criteria that in a natural language Iangue make it  possible to define an acceptable or interpretable sentence Lastly a graph a growth curve an age pyramid a distribution  could are all statements any sentences that may accompany them are merely interpretation or commentary they are in no  way an equivalent this is proved by the fact that in a great many cases only an infinite number of sentences could equal  all the elements that are explicitly formulated in this sort of statement It would not appear to be possible therefore to  define a statement by the grammatical characteristics of the sentence   One last possibility remains at first sight the most likely of all Can one not say that there is a statement wherever one  can recognize and isolate an act of formulation  something like the speech act referred to by the English analysts This  term does not of course refer to the material act of speaking aloud or to oneself or of writing by hand or typewriter  nor does it refer to the intention of the individual who is speaking the fact that he wants to convince someone else to be  obeyed to discover the solution to a problem or to communicate information  nor does it refer to the possible result of  what he has said whether he has convinced someone or aroused his suspicion whether he was listened to and whether  his orders were carried out whether his prayer was heard what one is referring to is the operation that has been carried  out by the formula itself in its emergence promise order decree contract agreement observation The speech act is not  what took place just prior to the moment when the statement was made in the authors thought or intentions it is not  what might have happened after the event itself in its wake and the consequences that it gave rise to it is what occurred  by the very fact that a statement was made  and precisely this statement and no other in specific circumstances  Presumably therefore one individualization of statements        94   refers to the same criteria as the location of acts of formulation each act is embodied in a statement each statement  contains one of those acts They exist through one another in an exact reciprocal relationship   Yet such a correlation does not stand up to examination For one thing more than a statement is often required to  effect a speech act an oath a prayer a contract a promise or a demonstration usually require a certain number of distinct  formulas or separate sentences it would be difficult to challenge the right of each of these formulas and sentences to be  regarded as a statement on the pretext that they are all imbued with one and the same speech act In that case it might be  said that the act itself does not remain the same throughout the series of statements that in a prayer there are as many  limited successive and juxtaposed acts of prayer as demands formulated by distinct statements and that in a promise  there are as many engagements as sequences that can be individualized into separate statements But one cannot be  satisfied with this answer first because the act of formulation would no longer serve to define the statement but on the  contrary the act of formulation would be defined by the statement  which raises problems and requires criteria of  individualization Moreover certain speech acts can be regarded as complete in their particular unity only if several state ments have been made each in its proper place These acts are not constituted therefore by the series or sum of these  statements by their necessary juxtaposition they cannot be regarded as being present whole and entire in the least of  them and as renewing themselves with each one So one cannot establish a hiunivocal relation between the group of  statements and that of speech acts either   When one wishes to individualize statements one cannot therefore accept unreservedly any of the models borrowed  from grammar logic or analysis In all three cases one realizes that the criteria proposed are too numerous and too  heavy that they limit the extent of the statement and that although the statement sometimes takes on the forms described  and adjusts itself to them exactly it does not always do so one finds statements lacking in legitimate propositional  structure one finds statements where one cannot recognize a sentence one finds more statements that one can isolate  speech acts As if the statement were more tenuous less charged with determinations less strongly structured more  omnipresent too than all these figures as if it had         95   fewer features and ones less difficult to group together but as if by that very fact it rejected all possibility of describing  anything And this is all the more so in that it is difficult to see at what level it should be situated and by what method it  should be approached for all the analyses mentioned above there is never more than a support or accidental substance  in logical analysis it is what is left when the propositional structure has been extracted and defined for grammatical  analysis it is the series of linguistic elements in which one may or may not recognize the form of a sentence for the  analysis of speech acts it appears as the visible body in which they manifest themselves In relation to all these  descriptive approaches it plays the role of a residual element of a mere fact of irrelevant raw material     Must we admit in the end that the statement cannot possess a character of its own and that it cannot be adequately  defined in so far as it is for all analyses of language langage the extrinsic material on the basis of which they  determine their own object Must we admit that any series of signs figures marks or traces  whatever their organiza tion or probability may be  is enough to constitute a statement and that it is the role of grammar to say whether or not  it is a sentence the role of logic to decide whether or not it contains a propositional form the role of Analysis to  determine what speech act it may embody In which case we would have to admit that there is a statement whenever a  number of signs are juxtaposed  or even perhaps  when there is a single sign The threshold of the statement is the  threshold of the existence of signs Yet even here things are not so simple and the meaning of a term like the existence  of signs requires elucidation What does one mean when one says that there are signs and that it is enough for there to be  signs for there to he a statement What special status should be given to that verb to be   For it is obvious that statements do not exist in the same sense in which a language longue exists and with that  language a collection of signs defined by their contrasting characteristics and their rules of use a language in fact is  never given in itself in its totality it could only he so in a secondary way in the oblique form of a description that would  take it as its object the signs that make up its elements are forms that are imposed upon statements and control them from  within If there were no statements the language longue would not exist but no   96       statement is indispensable for a language to exist and one can always posit in place of any statement another statement  that would in no way modify the language The language exists only as a system for constructing possible statements  but in another respect it exists only as a more or less exhaustive description obtained from a collection of real  statements Language longue and statement are not at the same level of existence and one cannot say that there are  statement in the same way as one says that there are languages longues But is it enough then that the signs of a  language constitute a statement if they were produced articulated drawn made traced in one way or another if they  appeared in a moment of time and in a point in space if the voice that spoke them or the gesture that formed them gave  them the dimensions of a material existence Can the letters of the alphabet written by me haphazardly on to a sheet of  paper as an example of what is not a statement can the lead characters used for printing books  and one cannot deny  their materiality which has space and volume  can these signs spread out visible manipulable be reasonably regarded  as statements   When looked at more closely however these two examples the lead characters and the signs that I wrote down on the  sheet of paper are seen to be not quite superposable This pile of printers characters which I can hold in my hand or the  letters marked on the keyboard of a typewriter are not statements at most they are tools with which one can write  statements On the other hand what are the letters that I write down haphazardly on to a sheet of paper just as they come  to mind and to show that they cannot in their disordered state constitute a statement What figure do they form Are  they not a table of letters chosen in a contingent way the statement of an alphabetical series governed by other laws than  those of chance Similarly the table of random numbers that statisticians sometimes use is a series of numerical symbols  that are not linked together by any syntactical structure and yet that series is a statement that of a group of figures  obtained by procedures that eliminate everything that might increase the probability of the succeeding issues Let us look  at the example again the keyboard of a typewriter is not a statement but the same series of letters A Z E R T listed in  a typewriting manual is the statement of the alphabetical order adopted by French typewriters So we are        97  presented with a number of negative consequences a regular linguistic construction is not required in order to form a  statement this statement may be made up of a series possessing a minimal probability  but neither is it enough to have  any material effectuation of linguistic elements any emergence of signs in time and space for a statement to appear and  to begin to exist The statement exists therefore neither in the same way as a language longue although it is made up of  signs that are definable in their individuality only within a natural or artificial linguistic system nor in the same way as  the object presented to perception although it is always endowed with a certain materiality and can always he situated in  accordance with spatiotemporal coordinates   This is not the place to answer the general question of the statement but the problem can be clarified the statement is  not the same kind of unit as the sentence the proposition or the speech act it cannot be referred therefore to the same  criteria but neither is it the same kind of unit as a material object with its limits and independence In its way of being  unique neither entirely linguistic nor exclusively material it is indispensable if we want to say whether or not there is a  sentence proposition or speech act and whether the sentence is correct or acceptable or interpretable whether the  proposition is legitimate and well constructed whether the speech act fulfils its requirements and was in fact carried out     We must not seek in the statement a unit that is either long or short strongly and weakly structured but one that is caught  up like the others in a logical grammatical locutory nexus It is not so much one element among others a division that  can he located at a certain level of analysis as a function that operates vertically in relation to these various units and  which enables one to say of a series of signs whether or not they are present in it The statement is not therefore a  structure that is a group of relations between variable elements thus authorizing a possibly infinite number of concrete  models it is a function of existence that properly belongs to signs and on the basis of which one may then decide  through analysis or intuition whether or not they make sense according to what rule they follow one another or are  juxtaposed of what they are the sign and what sort of act is carried out by their formulation oral or written One should  not be surprised then if one has failed to find structural         98   criteria of unity for the statement this is because it is not in itself a unit but a function that cuts across a domain of  structures and possible unities and which reveals them with concrete contents in time and space   It is this function that we must now describe as such that is in its actual practice its conditions the rules that govern  it and the field in which it operates   99        2 THE ENUNCIATIVE FUNCTION  It is useless therefore to look for the statement among unitary groups of signs The statement is neither a syntagma nor a  rule of construction nor a canonic form of succession and permutation it is that which enables such groups of signs to  exist and enables these rules or forms to become manifest But although it enables them to exist it does so in a special  way  a way that must not be confused with the existence of signs as elements of a language longue or with the  material existence of those marks that occupy a fragment of space or last for a variable length of time It is this special  mode of existence characteristic of every series of signs providing it is stated that we must now examine     a So let us take once again the example of those signs made or drawn in a defined materiality and grouped in a  particular way which may or may not be arbitrary but which in any case is not grammatical the keyboard of a  typewriter or a handful of printers characters All that is required is that the signs be given that I copy them on to a sheet  of paper in the same order in which they appear but without producing a word for a statement to emerge the statement  of the letters of the alphabet in an order that makes the typing of them easier and the statement of a random group of  letters What has happened   100     then that a statement should have been made What can the second group possess that is not possessed by the first  Reduplication the fact that it is a copy Certainly not since the keyboards of typewriters all copy a certain model and  are not by that very fact statements The intervention of a subject This answer is inadequate for two reasons it is not  enough that the reiteration of a series be due to the initiative of an individual for it to be transformed by that very fact  into a statement and in any case the problem does not lie in the cause or origin of the reduplication but in the special  relation between the two identical series The second series is not a statement because and only because a hiunivocal  relation can be established between each of its elements in the first series this relation characterizes either the fact of  duplication if it is simply a copy or the exactitude of the statement if one has in fact crossed the threshold of  enunciation but it does not allow us to define this threshold and the very fact of the statement A series of signs will  become a statement on condition that it possesses something else which may be strangely similar to it and almost  identical as in the example chosen a specific relation that concerns itself  and not its cause or its elements   It may be objected that there is nothing enigmatic about this relation that on the contrary it is a very familiar one  which is constantly being analysed that in fact it concerns the relation of the signifier significant to the signified  signifie of the name to what it designates the relation of the sentence to its meaning the relation of the proposition to  its referent referent But I believe that one can show that the relation of the statement to what it states is not  superposable on any of these relations   The statement even if reduced to a nominal syntagma The boat even if it is reduced to a proper noun Peter  does not have the same relation with what it states as the name with what it designates or signifies The name or noun is  a linguistic element that may occupy different places in grammatical groups its meaning is defined by its rules of use  whether these concern individuals who may be validly designated by it or syntactical structures in which it may  correctly participate a noun is defined by its possibility of recurrence A statement exists outside any possibility of  reappearing and the relation that it possesses with what it states is not identical with a group of rules of   101     use It is a very special relation and if in these conditions an identical formulation reappears with the same words  substantially the same names  in fact exactly the same sentence  it is not necessarily the same statement   Nor should the relation between a statement and what it states be confused with the relation between a proposition and  its referent We know that logicians say that a proposition like The golden mountain is in California cannot be verified  because it has no referent its negation is therefore neither more nor less true than its affirmation Should we say similarly  that a statement refers to nothing if the proposition to which it lends existence has no referent Rather the reverse We  should say not that the absence of a referent brings with it the absence of a correlate for the statement but that it is the  correlate of the statement  that to which it refers not only what is said but also what it speaks of its theme  which  makes it possible to say whether or not the proposition has a referent it alone decides this in a definitive way Let us  suppose in fact that the formulation The golden mountain is in California is found not in a geography book nor in a  travel book but in a novel or in some fictional context or other one could still accord it a value of truth or error  according to whether the imaginary world to which it refers does or does not authorize such a geological and geo graphical fantasy We must know to what the statement refers what is its space of correlations if we are to say whether  a proposition has or has not a referent The present king of France is bald lacks a referent only if one supposes that the  statement refers to the world of contemporary historical information The relation of the proposition to the referent  cannot serve as a model or as a law for the relation of the statement to what it states The latter relation not only does not  belong to the same level as the former but it is anterior to it   Nor is it superposable to the relation that may exist between a sentence and its meaning The gap between these two  forms of relation appears clearly in the case of two famous sentences that are meaningless in spite of their perfectly  correct grammatical structure as in the example Colourless green ideas sleep furiously In fact to say that a sentence  like this is meaningless presupposes that one has already excluded a number of possibilities  that it describes a dream  that it is part of a poetic text that it is a coded message that it is spoken by a   102  drug addict  and that one assumes it to be a certain type of statements that must refer in a very definite way to some  visible reality The relation of a sentence with its meaning resides within a specific wellstabilized enunciative relation  Moreover even if these sentences are taken at an enunciative level at which they are meaningless they are not as  statements deprived of correlations there are those that enable one to say for example that ideas are never either  coloured or colourless and therefore that the sentence is meaningless and these correlations concern a level of reality in  which ideas are invisible and in which colours can he seen etc there are also those correlations that validate the  sentence in question as a mention of a type of correct syntactical organization that was also meaningless and these  correlations concern the level of the language langue with its laws and properties A sentence cannot be non significant it refers to something by virtue of the fact that it is a statement   How then can we define this relation that characterizes the statement as statement  a relation that seems to be  implicitly presupposed by the sentence or the proposition and which is anterior to it How can we disentangle it from  those relations of meaning or those values of truth with which it is usually confused Any statement as simple a  statement as one can imagine does not have as its correlate an individual or a particular object that is designated by this  or that word in the sentence in the case of a statement like The golden mountain is in California the correlate is not the  formation real or imaginary possible or absurd that is designated by the nominal syntagma that serves as the subject  But nor is the correlate of the statement a state of things or a relation capable of verifying the proposition in the example  chosen this would be the spatial inclusion of a particular mountain in a particular region On the other hand what might  he defined as the correlate of the statement is a group of domains in which such objects may appear and to which such  relations may be assigned it would for example be a domain of material objects possessing a certain number of  observable physical properties relations of perceptible size  or on the contrary it would he domain of fictitious  objects endowed with arbitrary properties even if they have a certain constancy and a certain coherence without any  authority of experimental or perceptive verification it would be a domain of spatial and geographical localizations        103  with coordinates distances relations of proximity and of inclusion  or on the contrary a domain of symbolic  appurtenances and secret kinships it would be a domain of objects that exist at the same moment and on the same time scale as the statement is formulated or it would be a domain of objects that belongs to a quite different present  that  indicated and constituted by the statement itself and not that to which the statement also belongs A statement is not  confronted face to face as it were by a correlate  or the absence of a correlate  as a proposition has or has not a  referent or as a proper noun designates someone or no one It is linked rather to a referential that is made up not of  things facts realities or beings but of laws of possibility rules of existence for the objects that are named  designated or described within it and for the relations that are affirmed or denied in it The referential of the statement  forms the place the condition the field of emergence the authority to differentiate between individuals or objects states     of things and relations that are brought into play by the statement itself it defines the possibilities of appearance and  delimitation of that which gives meaning to the sentence a value as truth to the proposition It is this group that  characterizes the enunciative level of the formulation in contrast to its grammatical and logical levels through the  relation with these various domains of possibility the statement makes of a syntagma or a series of symbols a sentence to  which one may or may not ascribe a meaning a proposition that may or may not be accorded a value as truth   One can see in any case that the description of this enunciative level can be performed neither by a formal analysis  nor by a semantic investigation nor by verification but by the analysis of the relations between the statement and the  spaces of differentiation in which the statement itself reveals the differences     b A statement also differs from any series of linguistic elements by virtue of the fact that it possesses a particular  relation with a subject We must now define the nature of this relation and above all distinguish it from other relations  with which it might be confused   We must not in fact reduce the subject of the statement to the firstperson grammatical elements that are present  within the sentence First because the subject of the sentence is not within the linguistic        104  syntagma secondly because a statement that does not involve a first person nevertheless has a subject lastly and above  all all statements that have a fixed grammatical form whether in the first or second person do not have the same type  of relation with the subject of the statement It is easy to see that this relation is not the same in a statement of the type  Night is falling and Every effect has a cause while in the case of a statement of the type Longtemps je me Buis  couche de bonne heure For a long time I used to go to bed early the relation to the enunciating subject is not the same  if one hears it spoken in the course of a conversation and if one reads it at the beginning of Prousts A la Recherche du  temps perdu   Is not this subject exterior to the sentence quite simply the individual who spoke or wrote those words As we know  there can be no signs without someone or at least something to emit them For a series of signs to exist there must   in accordance with the system of causality  be an author or a transmitting authority But this author is not identical  with the subject of the statement and the relation of production that he has with the formulation is not superposable to  the relation that unites the enunciating subject and what he states Let us ignore the oversimple case of a group of signs  that have been materially fashioned or traced their production implies an author even though there is neither a statement  nor a subject of a statement One might also mention by way of showing the dissociation between the transmitter of  signs and the subject of a statement the case of a text read by a third person or that of an actor speaking his part But  these are extreme cases Generally speaking it would seem at first sight at least that the subject of the statement is  precisely he who has produced the various elements with the intention of conveying meaning Yet things are not so  simple In a novel we know that the author of the formulation is that real individual whose name appears on the title  page of the book we are still faced with the problem of the dialogue and sentences purporting to express the thoughts of  a character we are still faced with the problem of texts published under a pseudonym and we know all the difficulties  that these duplications raise for practitioners of interpretative analysis when they wish to relate these formulations en  bloc to the author of the text to what he wanted to say to what he thought in short to that great silent hidden uniform        105  discourse on which they build that whole pyramid of different levels but even apart from those authorities of  formulation that are not identical with the individualauthor the statements of the novel do not have the same subject  when they provide as if from the outside the historical and spatial setting of the story when they describe things as they  would be seen by an anonymous invisible neutral individual who moves magically among the characters of the novel or  when they provide as if by an immediate internal decipherment the verbal version of what is silently experienced by a  character Although the author is the same in each case although he attributes them to no one other than himself  although he does not invent a supplementary link between what he is himself and the text that one is reading these  statements do not presuppose the same characteristics for the enunciating subject they do not imply the same relation  between this subject and what is being stated   It might be said that the often quoted example of the fictional text has no conclusive validity or rather that it questions  the very essence of literature and not the status the subject of statements in general According to this view it is in the  nature of literature that the author should appear to be absent conceal himself within it delegate his authority or divide  himself up and one should not draw a general conclusion from this dissociation that the subject of the statement is  distinct in everything  in nature status function and identity  from the author of the formulation Yet this gap is not  confined to literature alone It is absolutely general in so far as the subject of the statement is a particular function but is  not necessarily the same from one statement to another in so far as it is an empty function that can be filled by virtually  any individual when he formulates the statement and in so far as one and the same individual may occupy in turn in the  same series of statements different positions and assume the role of different subjects Take the example of a     mathematical treatise In the sentence in the preface in which one explains why this treatise was written in what  circumstances in response to what unsolved problems or with what pedagogical aim in view using what methods after  what attempts and failures the position of the enunciative subject can be occupied only by the author or authors of the  formulation the conditions of individualization of the subject are in fact very strict very        106  numerous and authorize in this case only one possible subject On the other hand if in the main body of the treatise one  meets a proposition like Two quantities equal to a third quantity are equal to each other the subject of the statement is  the absolutely neutral position indifferent to time space and circumstances identical in any linguistic system and in any  code of writing or symbolization that any individual may occupy when affirming such a proposition Moreover  sentences like We have already shown that    necessarily involve statements of precise contextual conditions that were  not implied by the preceding formulation the position is then fixed within a domain constituted by a finite group of  statements it is localized in a series of enunciative events that must already have occurred it is established in a  demonstrative time whose earlier stages are never lost and which do not need therefore to be begun again and repeated  identically to be made present once more a mention is enough to reactivate them in their original validity it is  determined by the prior existence of a number of effective operations that need not have been performed by one and the  same individual he who is speaking now but which rightfully belong to the enunciating subject which are at his  disposal and of which he may avail himself when necessary The subject of such a statement will be defined by these  requisites and possibilities taken together and he will not be described as an individual who has really carried out certain  operations who lives in an unbroken never forgotten time who has interiorized in the horizon of his consciousness a  whole group of true propositions and who retains in the living present of his thought their potential reappearance this is  merely in the case of individuals the psychological lived aspect of their position as enunciating subjects   Similarly one might describe the specific position of the enunciating subject in sentences like I call straight any series  of points that  or Let there be a finite series of any elements in each case the position of the subject is linked to the  existence of an operation that is both determined and present in each case the subject of the statement is also the subject  of the operation he who establishes the definition of a straight line is also he who states it he who posits the existence of  a finite series is also and at the same time he who states it and in each case the subject links by means of this  operation and the statement in        107  which it is embodied his statement as his own law There is a difference however in the first case what is stated is a  convention of language langage  of that language that the enunciating subject must use and within which he is  defined the enunciating subject and what is stated are therefore at the same level whereas for a formal analysis a  statement like this one implies the difference of level proper to metalanguage in the second case on the other hand the  enunciating subject brings into existence outside himself an object that belongs to a previously defined domain whose  laws of possibility have already been articulated and whose characteristics precede the enunciation that posits it We saw  above that the position of the enunciating subject is not always identical in the affirmation of a true proposition we now  see that it is also not identical when an operation is carried out within the statement itself   So the subject of the statement should not he regarded as identical with the author of the formulation  either in  substance or in function He is not in fact the cause origin or startingpoint of the phenomenon of the written or spoken  articulation of a sentence nor is it that meaningful intention which silently anticipating words orders them like the  visible body of its intuition it is not the constant motionless unchanging focus of a series of operations that are  manifested in turn on the surface of discourse through the statements It is a particular vacant place that may in fact be  filled by different individuals but instead of being defined once and for all and maintaining itself as such throughout a  text a book or an oeuvre this place varies  or rather it is variable enough to he able either to persevere unchanging  through several sentences or to alter with each one It is a dimension that characterizes a whole formulation qua  statement It is one of the characteristics proper to the enunciative function and enables one to describe it If a proposition  a sentence a group of signs can be called statement it is not therefore because one day someone happened to speak  them or put them into some concrete form of writing it is because the position of the subject can be assigned To describe  a formulation qua statement does not consist in analysing the relations between the author and what he says or wanted to  say or said without wanting to  but in determining what position can and must be occupied by any individual if he is to  be the subject of it        108           c The third characteristic of the enunciative function it cannot operate without the existence of an associated  domain This makes the statement something other something more than a mere collection of signs which in  order to exist need only a material base  a writing surface sound malleable material the hollowed incision of a  trace But this also and above all distinguishes it from the sentence and the proposition   Take a group of words or symbols In order to decide whether they constitute a grammatical unit like the  sentence or a logical unit like the proposition it is necessary and enough to determine the rules according to  which it was constructed Peter arrived yesterday forms a sentence but Yesterday arrived Peter does not A  B   C  D constitutes a proposition but ABC   D does not Only an examination of the elements and of their  distribution in reference to the system  natural or artificial  of the language longue enables us to distinguish  between what is and what is not a proposition between what is a sentence and what is merely an accumulation of  words Moreover this examination is enough to determine to what type of grammatical structure the sentence in  question belongs affirmative sentence in the past tense containing a nominal subject etc or to what type of  proposition the series of signs in question belongs an equivalence between two additions One can even conceive  of a sentence or a proposition that is selfdetermining that requires no other sentence or proposition to serve as a  context no other associated sentences or propositions that such a sentence or proposition would in such  conditions be useless and unusable does not mean that one would not be able to recognize it even in its  singularity   One could no doubt make a number of objections to this One might say for example that a proposition can be  established and individualized as such only if one knows the system of axioms that it obeys do not those  definitions those rules those conventions of writing form an associated field inseparable from the proposition  similarly the rules of grammar implicitly at work in the competence of the subject are necessary if one is to  recognize a sentence and a sentence of a certain type It should be noted however that this group  actual or  potential  does not belong to the same level as the proposition or the sentence but that it has a bearing on their  possible elements succession and      109   distribution The group is not associated with them it is presupposed by them One might also object that many non tautological propositions cannot be verified on the basis of their rules of construction alone and that recourse to the  referent is needed if one is to decide whether they are true or false but true or false a proposition remains a proposition  and it is not recourse to the referent that decides whether or not it is a proposition The same goes for sentences in many  cases they can yield their meaning only in relation to the context whether they contain deictic elements that refer to a  concrete situation or make use of first  or secondperson pronouns that designate the speaking subject and his  interlocutors or make use of pronominal elements or connecting particles that refer to earlier or later sentences but the  fact that its meaning cannot be completed does not prevent the sentence from being grammatically complete and  autonomous Certainly one is not very sure what a group of words like Ill tell you that tomorrow means in any case  one can neither date this tomorrow nor name the interlocutors nor guess what is to be said Nevertheless it is a  perfectly delimited sentence obeying the rules of construction of the language longue in which it is written Lastly one  might object that without a context it is sometimes difficult to define the structure of a sentence I shall never know if  he is dead may be construed I shall never know whether or not he is dead or I shall never be informed of his death  when this even occurs But this ambiguity is perfectly definable simultaneous possibilities can be posited that belong to  the structure proper of the sentence Generally speaking one can say that a sentence or a proposition  even when  isolated even divorced from the natural context that could throw light on to its meaning even freed or cut off from all  the elements to which implicitly or not it refers  always remains a sentence or a proposition and can always be  recognized as such   On the other hand the enunciative function  and this shows that it is not simply a construction of previously existing  elements  cannot operate on a sentence or proposition in isolation It is not enough to say a sentence it is not even  enough to say it in a particular relation to a field of objects or in a particular relation to a subject for a statement to exist  it must be related to a whole adjacent field Or rather since this is not some additional relation that is superimposed on     the others one       110  cannot say a sentence one cannot transform it into a statement unless a collateral space is brought into operation A  statement always has borders peopled by other statements These borders are not what is usually meant by context   real or verbal  that is all the situational or linguistic elements taken together that motivate a formulation and  determine its meaning They are distinct from such a context precisely in so far as they make it possible the contextual  relation between one sentence and those before and after it is not the same in the case of a novel and in that of a treatise  in physics the contextual relation between a formulation and the objective environment is not the same in a conversation  and in the account of an experiment It is against the background of a more general relation between the formulations  against the background of a whole verbal network that the effect of context may he determined Nor are these borders  identical with the various texts and sentences that the subject may be conscious of when he speaks again they are more  extensive than such a psychological setting and to a certain extent they determine that setting for according to the  position status and role of one formulation among others  according to whether it belongs to the field of literature or  as an isolated remark whether it is part of a narrative or the account of a demonstration  the way in which other  statements are present in the mind of the subject will not he the same neither the same level nor the same form of  linguistic experience of verbal memory of reference to what has already been said is operating in each case The  psychological halo of a formulation is controlled from afar by the arrangement of the enunciative field   The associated field that turns a sentence or a series of signs into a statement and which provides them with a  particular context a specific representative content forms a complex web It is made up first of all by the series of other  formulations within which the statement appears and forms one element the network of spoken formulations that make  up a conversation the architecture of a demonstration hound on the one side by its premises and on the other by its  conclusion the series of affirmations that make up a narrative The associated field is also made up of all the  formulations to which the statement refers implicitly or not either by repeating them modifying them or adapting  them or by opposing them or by commenting on them        111     there can be no statement that in one way or another does not reactualize others ritual elements in a narrative  previously accepted propositions in a demonstration conventional sentences in a conversation The associated field is  also made up of all the formulations whose subsequent possibility is determined by the statement and which may follow  the statement as its consequence its natural successor or its conversational retort an order does not open up the same  enunciative possibilities as the propositions of an axiomatic or the beginning of a narrative Lastly the associated field  is made up of all the formulations whose status the statement in question shares among which it takes its place without  regard to linear order with which it will fade away or with which on the contrary it will be valued preserved  sacralized and offered as a possible object to a future discourse a statement is not dissociable from the status that it  may receive as literature or as an unimportant remark that is barely worthy of being forgotten or as a scientific truth  valid for all time or as prophetic words etc Generally speaking one can say that a sequence of linguistic elements is a  statement only if it is immersed in an enunciative field in which it then appears as a unique element   The statement is not the direct projection on to the plane of language langage of a particular situation or a group of  representations It is not simply the manipulation by a speaking subject of a number of elements and linguistic rules At  the very outset from the very root the statement is divided up into an enunciative field in which it has a place and a  status which arranges for its possible relations with the past and which opens up for it a possible future Every  statement is specified in this way there is no statement in general no free neutral independent statement but a  statement always belongs to a series or a whole always plays a role among other statements deriving support from them  and distinguishing itself from them it is always part of a network of statements in which it has a role however minimal  it may be to play Whereas grammatical construction needs only elements and rules in order to operate whereas one  might just conceive of a language longue  an artificial one of course  whose only purpose is the construction of a  single sentence whereas the alphabet the rules of construction and transformation of a formal system being given one  can perfectly well        112  define the first proposition of this language langage the same cannot be said of the statement There is no statement  that does not presuppose others there is no statement that is not surrounded by a field of coexistences effects of series  and succession a distribution of functions and roles If one can speak of a statement it is because a sentence a  proposition figures at a definite point with a specific position in an enunciative network that extends beyond it     Against this background of enunciative coexistence there stand out at an autonomous and describable level the  grammatical relations between sentences the logical relations between propositions the metalinguistic relations between  an object language and one that defines the rules the rhetorical relations between groups or elements of sentences It is  permissible of course to analyse all these relations without taking as ones theme the enunciative field itself that is the  domain of coexistence in which the enunciative function operates But they can exist and are analysable only to the extent  that these sentences have been enunciated in other words to the extent that they are deployed in an enunciative field that  allows them to follow one another order one another coexist with one another and play roles in relation to one another  Far from being the principle of individualization of groups of signifiers the meaningful atom the minimum on the  basis of which there is meaning the statement is that which situates these meaningful units in a space in which they  breed and multiply     d Lastly for a sequence of linguistic elements to be regarded and analysed as a statement it must fulfil a fourth  condition it must have a material existence Could one speak of a statement if a voice had not articulated it if a surface  did not bear its signs if it had not become embodied in a senseperceptible element and if it had not left some trace  if  only for an instant  in someones memory or in some space Could one speak of a statement as an ideal silent figure  The statement is always given through some material medium even if that medium is concealed even if it is doomed to  vanish as soon as it appears And the statement not only needs this materiality its materiality is not given to it in  addition once all its determinations have been fixed it is partly made up of this materiality Even if a sentence is  composed of the same        113  words bears exactly the same meaning and preserves the same syntactical and semantic identity it does not constitute  the same statement if it is spoken by someone in the course of a conversation or printed in a novel if it was written one  day centuries ago and if it now reappears in an oral formulation The coordinates and the material status of the statement  are part of its intrinsic characteristics That is an obvious fact Or almost For as soon as one examines it a little more  closely things begin to blur and the problems increase   Of course it is tempting to say that if a statement is characterized partly at least by its material status and if its  identity is susceptible to a modification of that status the same can be said of sentences and propositions the materiality  of signs is not in fact entirely indifferent to grammar or even to logic We know what theoretical problems are presented  to logic by the material constancy of the symbols used how to define the identity of a symbol through the various  substances in which it may be embodied and the variations of form that it can tolerate How to recognize it and make  certain that it is the same if it must be defined as a concrete physical form we know too what problems are presented  to logic by the very notion of a series of symbols what do precede and follow mean Come before and after In what  space is such an order situated Much better known still are the relations of materiality and the language longue  the  role of writing and the alphabet the fact that neither the same syntax nor the same vocabulary operate in a written text  and in a conversation in a newspaper and in a book in a letter and on a poster moreover there are series of words that  form perfectly individualized and acceptable sentences if they feature as newspaper headlines and which nevertheless in  the course of a conversation could never stand as meaningful sentences Yet the materiality plays a much more important  role in the statement it is not simply a principle of variation a modification of the criteria of recognition or a  determination of linguistic subgroups It is constitutive of the statement itself a statement must have a substance a  support a place and a date And when these requisites change it too changes identity At this point a host of questions  arises Does the same sentence repeated very loudly and very softly form one or more statements When one learns a text  by heart does each recitation constitute a statement or should one regard it as a repetition of the same        114       statement A sentence is faithfully translated into a foreign language two distinct statements or one And in a collective  recitation  a prayer or a lesson  how many statements are produced How can one establish the identity of the  statement through all these various forms repetitions and transcriptions   The problem is no doubt obscured by the fact that there is often a confusion of different levels To begin with we  must set aside the multiplicity of enunciations We will say that an enunciation takes place whenever a group of signs is  emitted Each of these articulations has its spatiotemporal individuality Two people may say the same thing at the same  time but since there are two people there will he two distinct enunciations The same person may repeat the same  sentence several times this will produce the same number of enunciations distinct in time The enunciation is an  unrepeatable event it has a situated and dated uniqueness that is irreducible Yet this uniqueness allows of a number of  constants  grammatical semantic logical  by which one can by neutralizing the moment of enunciation and the  coordinates that individualize it recognize the general form of a sentence a meaning a proposition The time and place  of the enunciation and the material support that it uses then become very largely at least indifferent and what stands     out is a form that is endlessly repeatable and which may give rise to the most dispersed enunciations But the statement  itself cannot be reduced to this pure event of enunciation for despite its materiality it cannot be repeated it would not  be difficult to say that the same sentence spoken by two people in slightly different circumstances constitute only one  statement And yet the statement cannot he reduced to a grammatical or logical form because to a greater degree than  that form and in a different way it is susceptible to differences of material substance time and place What then is  that materiality proper to the statement and which permits certain special types of repetition How is it that one can  speak of the same statement when there are several distinct enunciations of it yet must speak of several statements when  one can recognize identical forms structures rules of construction and intentions What then is this rule of repeatable  materiality that characterizes the statement   This may not he a perceptible qualitative materiality expressed in the form of colour sound or solidity and divided  up by the same        115  spatiotemporal observation as the perceptual space Let us take a very simple example a text reproduced several times  the successive editions of a book or better still the different copies of the same printing do not give rise to the same  number of distinct statements in all the editions of Les Fleurs du mal variants and rejected versions apart  we find the  same set of statements yet neither the characters nor the ink nor the paper nor even the placing of the text and the  positions of the signs are the same the whole texture of the materiality has changed But in this case these small  differences are not important enough to alter the identity of the statement and to bring about another they are all  neutralized in the general element  material of course but also institutional and economic  of the book a book  however many copies or editions are made of it however many different substances it may use is a locus of exact  equivalence for the statements  for them it is an authority that permits repetition without any change of identity We  see from this first example that the materiality of the statement is not defined by the space occupied or the date of its  formulation but rather by its status as a thing or object A status that is never definitive but modifiable relative and  always susceptible of being questioned we know for example that for literary historians the edition of a book published  with the agreement of the author does not have the same status as posthumous editions that the statements in it have a  unique value that they are not one of the manifestations of one and the same whole that they are that by relation to  which there is and must be repetition Similarly between the text of a Constitution or a will or a religious revelation  and all the manuscripts or printed copies that reproduce them exactly with the same writing in the same characters and  on similar substances one cannot say that there is an equivalence on the one hand there are the statements themselves  and on the other their reproduction The statement cannot be identified with a fragment of matter but its identity varies  with a complex set of material institutions   For a statement may be the same whether written on a sheet of paper or published in a book it may be the same  spoken printed on a poster or reproduced on a taperecorder on the other hand when a novelist speaks a sentence in  daily life then reproduces the same sentence in the manuscript that he is writing attributing it to one of his        116  characters or even allowing it to be spoken by that anonymous voice that passes for that of the author one cannot say  that it is the same statement in each case The rule of materiality that statements necessarily obey is therefore of the order  of the institution rather than of the spatiotemporal localization it defines possibilities of reinscription and transcription  hut also thresholds and limits rather than limited and perishable individualities   The identity of a statement is subjected to a second group of conditions and limits those that are imposed by all the  other statements among which it figures by the domain in which it can be used or applied by the role and functions that  it can perform The affirmation that the earth is round or that species evolve does not constitute the same statement before  and after Copernicus before and after Darwin it is not for such simple formulations that the meaning of the words has  changed what changed was the relation of these affirmations to other propositions their conditions of use and  reinvestment the field of experience of possible verifications of problems to be resolved to which they can be referred  The sentence dreams fulfil desires may have been repeated throughout the centuries it is not the same statement in  Plato and in Freud The schemata of use the rules of application the constellations in which they can play a part their  strategic potentialities constitute for statements a field of stabilization that makes it possible despite all the differences of  enunciation to repeat them in their identity but this same field may also beneath the most manifest semantic  grammatical or formal identities define a threshold beyond which there can be no further equivalence and the appear ance of a new statement must be recognized But it is possible no doubt to go further there are cases in which one may  consider that there is only one statement even though the words the syntax and the language langue itself are not  identical Such cases are a speech and its simultaneous translation a scientific text in English and its French version a  notice printed in three columns in three different languages there are not in such cases the same number of statements as  there are languages used but a single group of statements in different linguistic forms Better still a given piece of  information may be retransmitted with other words with a simplified syntax or in an agreed code if the information  content and the uses to which it          117   could be put are the same one can say that it is the same statement in each case  Here too we are concerned not with a criterion of individualization for the statement but rather with its principle of   variation it is sometimes more diverse than the structure of the sentence and its identity is then finer more fragile more  easily modifiable than that of a semantic or grammatical whole sometimes more constant than that structure and its  identity is then broader more stable more susceptible to variations Moreover not only can this identity of the statement  not be situated once and for all in relation to that of the sentence but it is itself relative and oscillates according to the use  that is made of the statement and the way in which it is handled When one uses a statement in such a way as to reveal its  grammatical structure its rhetorical configuration or the connotations that it may carry it is obvious that one cannot  regard it as being identical in its original language longue and in a translation On the other hand if it is intended as part  of a procedure of experimental verification then text and translation constitute a single enunciative whole Or again at a  certain scale of macrohistory one may consider that an affirmation like species evolve forms the same statement in  Darwin and in Simpson at a finer level and considering more limited fields of use neoDarwinism as opposed to the  Darwinian system itself we are presented with two different statements The constancy of the statement the preservation  of its identity through the unique events of the enunciations its duplications through the identity of the forms constitute  the function of the field of use in which it is placed   The statement then must not be treated as an event that occurred in a particular time and place and that the most one  can do is recall it  and celebrate it from afar off  in an act of memory But neither is it an ideal form that can be  actualized in any body at any time in any circumstances and in any material conditions Too repeatable to be entirely  identifiable with the spatiotemporal coordinates of its birth it is more than the place and date of its appearance too  bound up with what surrounds it and supports it to be as free as a pure form it is more than a law of construction  governing a group of elements it is endowed with a certain modifiable heaviness a weight relative to the field in which  it is placed a constancy that allows of various uses a   118  temporal permanence that does not have the inertia of a mere trace or mark and which does not sleep on its own past  Whereas an enunciation may be begun again or reevoked and a linguistic or logical form may be reactualized the  statement may be repeated  but always in strict conditions    This repeatable materiality that characterizes the enunciative function reveals the statement as a specific and paradoxical  object but also as one of those objects that men produce manipulate use transform exchange combine decompose and  recompose and possibly destroy Instead of being something said once and for all  and lost in the past like the result of  a battle a geological catastrophe or the death of a king  the statement as it emerges in its materiality appears with a  status enters various networks and various fields of use is subjected to transferences or modifications is integrated into  operations and strategies in which its identity is maintained or effaced Thus the statement circulates is used disappears  allows or prevents the realization of a desire serves or resists various interests participates in challenge and struggle and  becomes a theme of appropriation or rivalry    119       3 THE DESCRIPTION OF STATEMENTS   I now find that the analysis has shifted its ground to a quite considerable extent it was my intention to return to the  definition of the statement which at the outset I had left in suspense It was as if I had regarded the statement as a unit  that could be established without difficulty and that all I had to do was describe its possibilities and laws of combination  I now realize that I could not define the statement as a unit of a linguistic type superior to the phenomenon of the word  inferior to the text but that I was dealing with an enunciative function that involved various units these may sometimes  be sentences sometimes propositions but they are sometimes made up of fragments of sentences series or tables of  signs a set of propositions or equivalent formulations and instead of giving a meaning to these units this function  relates them to a field of objects instead of providing them with a subject it opens up for them a number of possible  subjective positions instead of fixing their limits it places them in a domain of coordination and coexistence instead of  determining their identity it places them in a space in which they are used and repeated In short what has been  discovered is not the atomic statement  with its apparent meaning its origin its limits and its individuality  but the          120   operational field of the enunciative function and the conditions according to which it reveals various units which may  be but need not be of a grammatical or logical order But I now feel that I must answer two questions what do I now  understand by the task which I originally set myself of describing statements How can this theory of the statement be  adjusted to the analysis of discursive formations that I outlined previously   I First task fix the vocabulary If we agree to call verbal performance or better linguistic performance any group of  signs produced on the basis of a natural or artificial language langue we could call formulation the individual or  possibly collective act that reveals on any material and according to a particular form that group of signs the  formulation is an event that can always be located by its spatiotemporal coordinates which can always be related to an  author and which may constitute in itself a specific act a performative act as the British analysts call it we can call  sentence or proposition the units that grammar or logic may recognize in a group of signs these units may always be  characterized by the elements that figure in them and by the rules of construction that unite them in relation to the  sentence and the proposition the questions of origin time and place and context are merely subsidiary the decisive  question is that of their correctness if only under the form of acceptability We will call statement the modality of  existence proper to that group of signs a modality that allows it to be something more than a series of traces something  more than a succession of marks on a substance something more than a mere object made by a human being a modality  that allows it to be in relation with a domain of objects to prescribe a definite position to any possible subject to be  situated among other verbal performances and to be endowed with a repeatable materiality We can now understand the  reason for the equivocal meaning of the term discourse which I have used and abused in many different senses in the  most general and vaguest way it denoted a group of verbal performances and by discourse then I meant that which was  produced perhaps all that was produced by the groups of signs But I also meant a group of acts of formulation a series        121  of sentences or propositions Lastly  and it is this meaning that was finally used together with the first which served in  a provisional capacity  discourse is constituted by a group of sequences of signs in so far as they are statements that  is in so far as they can be assigned particular modalities of existence And if I succeed in showing as I shall try to do  shortly that the law of such a series is precisely what I have so far called a discursive formation if I succeed in showing  that this discursive formation really is the principle of dispersion and redistribution not of formulations not of sentences  not of propositions but of statements in the sense in which I have used this word the term discourse can he defined as  the group of statements that belong to a single system of formation thus I shall be able to speak of clinical discourse  economic discourse the discourse of natural history psychiatric discourse   I am well aware that most of these definitions do not conform with current usage linguists usually give the word  discourse a quite different meaning logicians and analysts use the term statement in a different way But my intention  here is not to transfer to some hitherto benighted domain a set of concepts a form of analysis and a theory that have  been formed elsewhere and I do not intend to use a model by applying it with its own efficacy to new contents Not of  course that I wish to question the value of such a model not that I wish even before trying it to limit its application or  to lay down the threshold that it must not cross But I would like to reveal a descriptive possibility outline the domain of  which it is capable define its limits and its autonomy This descriptive possibility is articulated upon others it does not  derive from them   In particular then the analysis of statements does not claim to he a total exhaustive description of language  langage or of what was said In the whole density implied by verbal performances it is situated at a particular level  that must be distinguished from the others characterized in relation to them and abstract In particular it does not replace  a logical analysis of propositions a grammatical analysis of sentences a psychological or contextual analysis of  formulations it is another way of attacking verbal performances of dissociating their complexity of isolating the terms  that are entangled in its web and of locating the various regularities that they obey By confronting the        122  statement with the sentence or the proposition I am not trying to rediscover a lost totality or to resuscitate as many  would nostalgically like to do the plenitude of living speech the richness of the Word the profound unity of the Logos  The analysis of statements corresponds to a specific level of description    2 The statement then is not an elementary unity that can be added to the unities described by grammar or logic It  cannot be isolated like a sentence a proposition or an act of formulation To describe a statement is not a matter of     isolating and characterizing a horizontal segment but of defining the conditions in which the function that gave a series  of signs a series that is not necessarily grammatical or logically structured an existence and a specific existence can  operate An existence that reveals such a series as more than a mere trace but rather a relation to a domain of objects as  more than the result of an action or an individual operation but rather a set of possible positions for a subject as more  than an organic autonomous whole closed in upon itself and capable of forming meaning of its own accord but rather an  element in a field of coexistence as more than a passing event or an inert object but rather a repeatable materiality The  description of statements is concerned in a sort of vertical dimension with the conditions of existence of different groups  of signifiers signifiants Hence a paradox the description of statements does not attempt to evade verbal performances  in order to discover behind them or below their apparent surface a hidden element a secret meaning that lies buried  within them or which emerges through them without saying so and yet the statement is not immediately visible it is not  given in such a manifest way as a grammatical or logical structure even if such a structure is not entirely clear or is very  difficult to elucidate The statement is neither visible nor hidden   Not hidden by definition since it characterizes the modalities of existence proper to a group of effectively produced  signs The analysis of statements can never confine its attention to the things said to the sentences that were actually  spoken or written to the signifying elements that were traced or pronounced  and more particularly to that very  uniqueness that gives them existence offers them to the view of the reader to a possible reactivation to innumerable uses  or possible        123  transformations among other things but not like other things It cannot concern only realized verbal performances since  it analyses them at the level of their existence it is a description of things said precisely as they were said The analysis  of statements then is a historical analysis but one that avoids all interpretation it does not question things said as to  what they are hiding what they were really saying in spite of themselves the unspoken element that they contain the  proliferation of thoughts images or fantasies that inhabit them but on the contrary it questions them as to their mode of  existence what it means to them to have come into existence to have left traces and perhaps to remain there awaiting  the moment when they might be of use once more what it means to them to have appeared when and where they did   they and no others From this point of view there is no such thing as a latent statement for what one is concerned with is  the fact of language langage   A difficult thesis to sustain We know  and this has probably been the case ever since men began to speak  that  one thing is often said in place of another that one sentence may have two meanings at once that an obvious meaning  understood without difficulty by everyone may conceal a second esoteric or prophetic meaning that a more subtle  deciphering or perhaps only the erosion of time will finally reveal that beneath a visible formulation there may reign  another that controls it disturbs it and imposes on it an articulation of its own in short that in one way or another things  said say more than themselves But in fact these apparent duplications this unsaid that is nevertheless said do not affect  the statement at least as it has been defined here Polysemia  which justifies hermeneutics and the discovery of another  meaning  concerns the sentence and the semantic fields that it employs the same group of words may give rise to  several meanings and to several possible constructions there may be therefore interwoven or alternating different  meanings operating on the same enunciative base Similarly the suppression of one verbal performance by another their  substitution or interference are phenomena that belong to the level of the formulation even if they have incidences on  the linguistic or logical structures but the statement itself is not concerned with this duplication or this suppression  since it is the modality of existence of the verbal performance as it has taken place The        124  statement cannot be regarded as the cumulative result or the crystallization of several fluctuating scarcely articulated and  mutually opposed statements The statement is not haunted by the secret presence of the unsaid of hidden meanings of  suppressions on the contrary the way in which these hidden elements function and in which they can be restored  depends on the enunciative modality itself we know that the unsaid the suppressed is not the same  either in its  structure or in its effect  in the case of a mathematical statement a statement in economics an autobiography or the  account of a dream   However to all these various modalities of the unsaid that may be located against the background of the enunciative  field should no doubt be added a lack which instead of being inside seems to be correlative with this field and to play a  role in the determination of its very existence There may in fact be  and probably always are  in the conditions of  emergence of statements exclusions limits or gaps that divide up their referential validate only one series of modalities  enclose groups of coexistence and prevent certain forms of use But one should not confuse either in its status or in its  effect the lack that is characteristic of an enunciative regularity and the meanings concealed in what is formulated in it    3 Although the statement cannot be hidden it is not visible either it is not presented to the perception as the manifest  bearer of its limits and characteristics It requires a certain change of viewpoint and attitude to be recognized and  examined in itself Perhaps it is like the overfamiliar that constantly eludes one those familiar transparencies which     although they conceal nothing in their density are nevertheless not entirely clear The enunciative level emerges in its  very proximity   There are several reasons for this The first has already been given the statement is not just another unity  above or  below  sentences and propositions it is always invested in unities of this kind or even in sequences of signs that do not  obey their laws and which may be lists chance series tables it characterizes not what is given in them but the very fact  that they are given and the way in which they are given It has this quasiinvisibility of the there is which is effaced in  the very thing of which one can say there is this or that thing   Another reason the signifying structure of language langage           125     always refers back to something else objects are designated by it meaning is intended by it the subject is referred back  to it by a number of signs even if he is not himself present in them Language always seems to be inhabited by the other  the elsewhere the distant it is hollowed by absence Is it not the locus in which something other than itself appears does  not its own existence seem to be dissipated in this function But if one wishes to describe the enunciative level one must  consider that existence itself question language not in the direction to which it refers but in the dimension that gives it  ignore its power to designate to name to show to reveal to be the place of meaning or truth and instead turn ones  attention to the moment  which is at once solidified caught up in the play of the signifier and the signified  that  determines its unique and limited existence In the examination of language one must suspend not only the point of  view of the signified we are used to this by now but also that of the signifier and so reveal the fact that here and  there in relation to possible domains of objects and subjects in relation to other possible formulations and reuses there  is language   The last reason for this quasiinvisibility of the statement it is implied but never made explicit in all other analyses  of language If language is to he taken as an object decomposed into distinct levels described and analysed an  enunciative datum must exist that will always be determined and not infinite the analysis of a language longue always  operates on a corpus of words and texts the uncovering and interpretation of implicit meanings always rests on a limited  group of sentences the logical analysis of a system implies a given group of propositions in the rewriting in a formal  language langage The enunciative level is neutralized each time either it is defined only as a representative sample  that enables one to free endlessly applicable structures or it disappears into a pure appearance behind which the truth of  words is revealed or it acts as a neutral substance that serves as a support for formal relations The fact that each time it  is indispensable if an analysis is to take place deprives it of all relevance for the analysis itself If one adds to this that all  these descriptions can be made only when they themselves form finite groups of statements it will be clear why they are  surrounded on all sides by the enunciative field why they cannot free themselves from it and why they cannot take it         126  directly as its theme In considering statements in themselves we will not seek beyond all these analyses and at a deeper  level some secret or some root of language langage that they have omitted We shall try to render visible and  analysable that immediate transparency that constitutes the element of their possibility   Neither hidden nor visible the enunciative level is at the limit of language langage it is not in itself a group of  characteristics that are presented even in an unsystematic way to immediate experience but neither is it the enigmatic  silent remainder that it does not translate It defines the modality of its appearance its periphery rather than its internal  organization its surface rather than its content But the fact that one can describe this enunciative surface proves that the  given the datum of language is not the mere rending of a fundamental silence that the words sentences meanings  affirmations series of propositions do not hack directly on to a primeval night of silence but that the sudden appearance  of a sentence the flash of meaning the brusque gesture of the index finger of designation always emerge in the  operational domain of an enunciative function that between language as one reads and hears it and also as one speaks it  and the absence of any formulation there is not a profusion of things half said sentences left unfinished thoughts half  expressed an endless monologue of which only a few fragments emerge but before all  or in any case before it for it  depends on them  the conditions according to which the enunciative function operates This also proves that it is vain  to seek beyond structural formal or interpretative analyses of language a domain that is at last freed from all positivity  in which the freedom of the subject the labour of the human being or the opening up of a transcendental destiny could be  fulfilled One should not object to linguistic methods or logical analyses When you have said so much about the rules of  its construction what do you do with language itself in the plenitude of its living body What do you do with this  freedom or with this meaning that is prior to all signification without which individuals could not understand one  another in the neverending work of language Are you not aware that as soon as one has crossed the finite systems that  make possible the infinity of discourse but which are incapable of founding it and of accounting for it what one finds is  the mark of a transcendence or the work of the human being          127  Do you know that you have described only a few of the characteristics of a language langage whose emergence and  mode of being are entirely irreducible to your analyses Such objections must be set aside for if it is true that there is a  dimension there that belongs neither to logic nor to linguistics it is not for all that a restored transcendence nor a way  that has been reopened in the direction of an inaccessible origin nor a creation by the human being of his own meanings  Language in its appearance and mode of being is the statement as such it belongs to a description that is neither  transcendental nor anthropological The enunciative analysis does not lay down for linguistic or logical analyses the  limit beyond which they must renounce their power and recognize their powerlessness it does not mark the line that  encloses their domain it is deployed in another direction which intersects them The possibility of an enunciative  analysis if it is established must make it possible to raise the transcendental obstacle that a certain form of philosophical  discourse opposes to all analyses of language in the name of the being of that language and of the ground from which it  should derive its origin   I must now turn to the second group of questions how can the description of statements thus defined be adjusted to the  analysis of discursive formations the principles of which I outlined above And inversely to what extent can one say  that the analysis of discursive formations really is a description of statements in the sense in which I have used this  word It is important to answer these questions for it is at this point that the enterprise to which I have devoted myself  for so many years which I have developed in a somewhat blind way but of which I am now trying  even if I readjust  it even if I rectify a number of errors or imprudences  to recapture the general outline must close its circle As has  already become clear I am not trying to say here what I once tried to say in this or that concrete analysis or to describe  the project that I had in mind the obstacles that I encountered the attempts that I was forced to abandon the more or  less satisfactory results that I managed to obtain I am not describing an effective trajectory in order to indicate what  should have been and what will be from        128  now on I am trying to elucidate in itself  in order to measure it and to determine its requirements  a possibility of  description that I have used without being aware of its constraints and resources rather than trying to discover what I  said and what I might have said I shall try to reveal in its own regularity  a regularity that I have not yet succeeded in  mastering  what made it possible to say what I did But one can also see that I am not developing here a theory in the  strict sense of the term the deduction on the basis of a number of axioms of an abstract model applicable to an indefinite  number of empirical descriptions If such an edifice were ever possible the time for it has certainly not yet arrived I am  not inferring the analysis of discursive formations from a definition of statements that would serve as a basis nor am I  inferring the nature of statements from what discursive formations are as one was able to abstract them from this or that  description but I am trying to show how a domain can be organized without flaw without contradiction without internal  arbitrariness in which statements their principle of grouping the great historical unities that they may form and the  methods that make it possible to describe them are all brought into question I am not proceeding by linear deduction but  rather by concentric circles moving sometimes towards the outer and sometimes towards the inner ones beginning with  the problem of discontinuity in discourse and of the uniqueness of the statement the central theme I have tried to  analyse on the periphery certain forms of enigmatic groupings but the principles of unification with which I was then  presented and which are neither grammatical nor logical nor psychological and which consequently cannot refer either  to sentences propositions or representations forced me to return to the centre to that problem of the statement to try to  elucidate what is meant by the term statement And I will consider not that I have constructed a rigorous theoretical  model but that I have freed a coherent domain of description that I have if not established the model at least opened up  and arranged the possibility of one if I have been able to loop the loop and show that the analysis of discursive  formations really is centred on a description of the statement in its specificity In short if I have been able to show that  they really are the proper dimensions of the statement that are at work in the mapping of discursive formations Rather  than founding a theory  and perhaps before being        129  able to do so I do not deny that I regret not yet having succeeded in doing so  my present concern is to establish a  possibility   In examining the statement what we have discovered is a function that has a bearing on groups of signs which is  identified neither with grammatical acceptability nor with logical correctness and which requires if it is to operate a  referential which is not exactly a fact a state of things or even an object but a principle of differentiation a subject  not the speaking consciousness not the author of the formulation but a position that may be filled in certain conditions  by various individuals  an associated field which is not the real context of the formulation the situation in which it was  articulated but a domain of coexistence for other statements a materiality which is not only the substance or support of     the articulation but a status rules of transcription possibilities of use and reuse Now what has been described as  discursive formations are strictly speaking groups of statements That is groups of verbal performances that are not  linked to one another at the sentence level by grammatical syntactical or semantic links which are not linked to one  another at the proposition level by logical links links of formal coherence or conceptual connexion and which are not  linked either at the formulation level by psychological links either the identity of the forms of consciousness the  constancy of the mentalities or the repetition of a project but which are linked at the statement level That which implies  that one can define the general set of rules that govern their objects the form of dispersion that regularly divides up what  they say the system of their referentials that which implies that one defines the general set of rules that govern the  different modes of enunciation the possible distribution of the subjective positions and the system that defines and  prescribes them that which implies that one defines the set of rules common to all their associated domains the forms of  succession of simultaneity of the repetition of which they are capable and the system that links all these fields of co existence together lastly that which implies that one can define the general set of rules that govern the status of these  statements the way in which they are institutionalized received used reused combined together the mode according  to which they become objects of appropriation instruments for desire or interest elements for a strategy To describe  statements to describe the enunciative function of        130   which they are the bearers to analyse the conditions in which this function operates to cover the different domains that  this function presupposes and the way in which those domains are articulated is to undertake to uncover what might be  called the discursive formation Or again which amounts to the same thing but in the opposite direction the discursive  formation is the general enunciative system that governs a group of verbal performances  a system that is not alone in  governing it since it also obeys and in accordance with its other dimensions logical linguistic and psychological  systems What has been called discursive formation divides up the general plane of things said at the specific level of  statements The four directions in which it is analysed formation of objects formation of the subjective positions  formation of concepts formation of strategic choices correspond to the four domains in which the enunciative function  operates And if the discursive formations are free in relation to the great rhetorical unities of the text or the book if they  are not governed by the rigour of a deductive architecture if they are not identified with the oeuvre of an author it is  because they bring into play the enunciative level together with the regularities that characterize it and not the  grammatical level of sentences or the logical level of propositions or the psychological level of formulation   On this basis we can now advance a number of propositions that lie at the heart of these analyses     1  It can be said that the mapping of discursive formations independently of other principles of possible unification  reveals the specific level of the statement but it can also be said that the description of statements and of the way in  which the enunciative level is organized leads to the individualization of the discursive formations The two approaches  are equally justifiable and reversible The analysis of the statement and that of the formation are established  correlatively When the time finally comes to found a theory it will have to define a deductive order     2 A statement belongs to a discursive formation as a sentence belongs to a text and a proposition to a deductive  whole But whereas the regularity of a sentence is defined by the laws of a language longue        131  and that of a proposition by the laws of logic the regularity of statements is defined by the discursive formation itself  The fact of its belonging to a discursive formation and the laws that govern it are one and the same thing this is not  paradoxical since the discursive formation is characterized not by principles of construction but by a dispersion of fact  since for statements it is not a condition of possibility but a law of coexistence and since statements are not  interchangeable elements but groups characterized by their modality of existence     3So we can now give a full meaning to the definition of discourse that we suggested above We shall call  discourse a group of statements in so far as they belong to the same discursive formation it does not form a rhetorical  or formal unity endlessly repeatable whose appearance or use in history might be indicated and if necessary  explained  it is made up of a limited number of statements for which a group of conditions of existence can be  defined Discourse in this sense is not an ideal timeless form that also possesses a history the problem is not  therefore to ask oneself how and why it was able to emerge and become embodied at this point in time it is from  beginning to end historical  a fragment of history a unity and discontinuity in history itself posing the problem of  its own limits its divisions its transformations the specific modes of its temporality rather than its sudden irruption  in the midst of the complicities of time       4Lastly what we have called discursive practice can now be defined more precisely It must not he confused   with the expressive operation by which can individual formulates an idea a desire an image nor with the rational  activity that may operate in a system of inference nor with the competence of a speaking subject when he constructs  grammatical sentences it is a body of anonymous historical rules always determined in the time and space that have  defined a given period and for a given social economic geographical or linguistic area the conditions of operation  of the enunciative function     It remains for me now to invert the analysis and after referring discursive formations to the statements that they  describe to seek in another direction this time towards the exterior the legitimate use of        132  these notions what can be discovered through them how they can take their place among other  methods of description to what extent they can modify and redistribute the domain of the history  of ideas But before operating this inversion and in order to operate it more surely I shall remain  a little longer in the dimension that I have been exploring and try to define what the analysis of  the enunciative field and of the formations that divide it up require and exclude      133       4 RARITY EXTERIORITY ACCUMULATION   The enunciative analysis takes into consideration an element of rarity  Generally speaking the analysis of discourse operates between the twin poles of totality and plethora One shows how   the different texts with which one is dealing refer to one another organize themselves into a single figure converge with  institutions and practices and carry meanings that may be common to a whole period Each element considered is taken  as the expression of the totality to which it belongs and whose limits it exceeds And in this way one substitutes for the  diversity of the things said a sort of great uniform text which has never before been articulated and which reveals for the  first time what men really meant not only in their words and texts their discourses and their writings but also in the  institutions practices techniques and objects that they produced In relation to this implicit sovereign communal  meaning statements appear in superabundant proliferation since it is to that meaning alone that they all refer and to it  alone that they owe their truth a plethora of signifying elements in relation to this single signified signifie But this  primary and ultimate meaning springs up through the manifest formulations it hides beneath what appears and secretly  duplicates it because each discourse        134  contains the power to say something other than what it actually says and thus to embrace a plurality of meanings a  plethora of the signified in relation to a single signifier From this point of view discourse is both plenitude and endless  wealth   The analysis of statements and discursive formations opens up a quite contrary direction it wishes to determine the  principle according to which only the signifying groups that were enunciated could appear It sets out to establish a law  of rarity This task involves several aspects     It is based on the principle that everything is never said in relation to what might have been stated in a natural  language longue in relation to the unlimited combination of linguistic elements statements however numerous they  may be are always in deficit on the basis of the grammar and of the wealth of vocabulary available at a given period  there are in total relatively few things that are said We must look therefore for the principle of rarification or at least of     nonfilling of the field of possible formulations as it is opened up by the language longue Discursive formation appears  both as a principle of division in the entangled mass of discourses and as a principle of vacuity in the field of language  langage     We are studying statements at the limit that separates them from what is not said in the occurrence that allows them  to emerge to the exclusion of all others Our task is not to give voice to the silence that surrounds them nor to rediscover  all that in them and beside them had remained silent or had been reduced to silence Nor is it to study the obstacles that  have prevented a particular discovery held hack a particular formulation repressed a particular form of enunciation a  particular unconscious meaning or a particular rationality in the course of development but to define a limited system of  presences The discursive formation is not therefore a developing totality with its own dynamism or inertia carrying with  it in an unformulated discourse what it does not say what it has not yet said or what contradicts it at that moment it is  not a rich difficult germination it is a distribution of gaps voids absences limits divisions           135     However we are not linking these exclusions to a repression we do not presuppose that beneath manifest  statements something remains hidden and subjacent We are analysing statements not as being in the place of other  statements that have fallen below the line of possible emergence but as being always in their own place They are put  back into a space that is entirely deployed and involves no reduplication There is no subtext And therefore no plethora  The enunciative domain is identical with its own surface Each statement occupies in it a place that belongs to it alone  The description of a statement does not consist therefore in rediscovering the unsaid whose place it occupies nor how  one can reduce it to a silent common text but on the contrary in discovering what special place it occupies what  ramifications of the system of formations make it possible to map its localization how it is isolated in the general  dispersion of statements     This rarity of statements the incomplete fragmented form of the enunciative field the fact that few things in all  can be said explain that statements are not like the air we breathe an infinite transparency but things that are  transmitted and preserved that have value and which one tries to appropriate that are repeated reproduced and  transformed to which preestablished networks are adapted and to which a status is given in the institution things that  are duplicated not only by copy or translation but by exegesis commentary and the internal proliferation of meaning  Because statements are rare they are collected in unifying totalities and the meanings to be found in them are multiplied     Unlike all those interpretations whose very existence is possible only through the actual rarity of statements but which  nevertheless ignore that rarity and on the contrary take as their theme the compact richness of what is said the analysis  of discursive formations turns back towards that rarity itself it takes that rarity as its explicit object it tries to determine  its unique system and at the same time it takes account of the fact that there could have been interpretation To interpret  is a way of reacting to enunciative poverty and to compensate for it by a multiplication of meaning a way of speaking on  the basis of that poverty and yet despite it But to analyse a discursive formation is to        136  seek the law of that poverty it is to weigh it up and to determine its specific form In one sense therefore it is to weigh  the value of statements A value that is not defined by their truth that is not gauged by the presence of a secret content  but which characterizes their place their capacity for circulation and exchange their possibility of transformation not  only in the economy of discourse but more generally in the administration of scarce resources In this sense discourse  ceases to be what it is for the exegetic attitude an inexhaustible treasure from which one can always draw new and  always unpredictable riches a providence that has always spoken in advance and which enables one to hear when one  knows how to listen retrospective oracles it appears as an asset  finite limited desirable useful  that has its own  rules of appearance but also its own conditions of appropriation and operation an asset that consequently from the  moment of its existence and not only in its practical applications poses the question of power an asset that is by  nature the object of a struggle a political struggle   Another characteristic feature the analysis of statements treats them in the systematic form of exteriority Usually  the historical description of things said is shot through with the opposition of interior and exterior and wholly directed  by a desire to move from the exterior  which may be no more than contingency or mere material necessity a visible  body or uncertain translation  towards the essential nucleus of interiority To undertake the history of what has been  said is to redo in the opposite direction the work of expression to go back from statements preserved through time and  dispersed in space towards that interior secret that preceded them left its mark in them and in every sense of the term  is betrayed by them Thus the nucleus of the initiating subjectivity is freed A subjectivity that always lags behind  manifest history and which finds beneath events another more serious more secret more fundamental history closer  to the origin more firmly linked to its ultimate horizon and consequently more in control of all its determinations This  other history which runs beneath history constantly anticipating it and endlessly recollecting the past can be described   in a sociological or psychological way  as the evolution of mentalities it can be given a philosophical status in the  recollection of the Logos or the teleology of reason lastly it can be purified in           137     the problematic of a trace which prior to all speech is the opening of inscription the gap of deferred time it is always  the historicotranscendental theme that is reinvested   A theme whose enunciative analysis tries to free itself In order to restore statements to their pure dispersion In order  to analyse them in an exteriority that may be paradoxical since it refers to no adverse form of interiority In order to  consider them in their discontinuity without having to relate them by one of those shifts that disconnect them and render  them inessential to a more fundamental opening or difference In order to seize their very irruption at the place and at the  moment at which it occurred In order to rediscover their occurrence as an event Perhaps we should speak of neutrality  rather than exteriority but even this word implies rather too easily a suspension of belief an effacement or a placing in  parentheses of all position of existence whereas it is a question of rediscovering that outside in which in their relative  rarity in their incomplete proximity in their deployed space enunciative events are distributed     This task presupposes that the field of statements is not described as a translation of operations or processes that  take place elsewhere in mens thought in their consciousness or unconscious in the sphere of transcendental  constitutions but that it is accepted in its empirical modesty as the locus of particular events regularities relationships  modifications and systematic transformations in short that it is treated not as the result or trace of something else but as  a practical domain that is autonomous although dependent  and which can be described at its own level although it  must be articulated on something other than itself     It also presupposes that this enunciative domain refers neither to an individual subject nor to some kind of  collective consciousness nor to a transcendental subjectivity but that it is described as an anonymous field whose  configuration defines the possible position of speaking subjects Statements should no longer be situated in relation to a  sovereign subjectivity but recognize in the different forms of the speaking subjectivity effects proper to the enunciative  field      138   As a result it presupposes that in its transformations in its successive series in its derivations the field of  statements does not obey the temporality of the consciousness as its necessary model One must not hope  at least at  this level and in this form of description  to be able to write a history of things said that is legitimately in its form in  its regularity and in its nature the history of an individual or anonymous consciousness of a project of a system of  intentions of a set of aims The time of discourse is not the translation in a visible chronology of the obscure time of  thought     The analysis of statements operates therefore without reference to a cogito It does not pose the question of the  speaking subject who reveals or who conceals himself in what he says who in speaking exercises his sovereign  freedom or who without realizing it subjects himself to constraints of which he is only dimly aware In fact it is situated  at the level of the it is said  and we must not understand by this a sort of communal opinion a collective representation  that is imposed on every individual we must not understand by it a great anonymous voice that must of necessity speak  through the discourses of everyone but we must understand by it the totality of things said the relations the regularities  and the transformations that may be observed in them the domain of which certain figures certain intersections indicate  the unique place of a speaking subject and may be given the name of author Anyone who speaks but what he says is  not said from anywhere It is necessarily caught up in the play of an exteriority   The third feature of enunciative analysis it is addressed to specific forms of accumulation that can be identified  neither with an interiorization in the form of memory nor with an undiscriminating totalization of documents Usually  when one analyses already existing discourses one regards them as having sprung from an essential inertia they have  survived vived through chance or through the care with which men have treated them and the illusions that they have  entertained as to their value and the immortal dignity of their words but now they are nothing more than written symbols  piling up in dusty libraries slumbering in a sleep towards which they have never ceased to glide since the day they were  pronounced since they were forgotten   139  and their visible effect lost in time At most they may be lucky enough to be picked up and examined in some chance     reading at most they can discover that they bear the marks that refer back to the moment of their enunciation at most  once these marks have been deciphered they can by a sort of memory that moves across time free meanings thoughts  desires buried fantasies These four terms reading  trace  decipherment  memory however much importance  one may accord to one or another of them and whatever the metaphorical extent that one may accord it and which  enables it to embrace the other three define the system that usually makes it possible to snatch past discourse from its  inertia and for a moment to rediscover something of its lost vitality   Now the function of enunciative analysis is not to awaken texts from their present sleep and by reciting the marks  still legible on their surface to rediscover the flash of their birth on the contrary its function is to follow them through  their sleep or rather to take up the related themes of sleep oblivion and lost origin and to discover what mode of  existence may characterize statements independently of their enunciation in the density of time in which they are  preserved in which they are reactivated and used in which they are also  but this was not their original destiny   forgotten and possibly even destroyed     This analysis presupposes that statements are considered in the remanence remanence that is proper to them and  which is not that of an everrealizable reference back to the past event of the formulation To say that statements are  residual remanent is not to say that they remain in the field of memory or that it is possible to rediscover what they  meant but it means that they are preserved by virtue of a number of supports and material techniques of which the book  is of course only one example in accordance with certain types of institutions of which the library is one and with  certain statutory modalities which are not the same in the case of a religious text a law or a scientific truth This also  means that they are invested in techniques that put them into operation in practices that derive from them in the social  relations that they form or through those relations modify Lastly it means that things do not have quite the same mode  of existence the        140   same system of relations with their environment the same schemata of use the same possibilities of transformation  once they have been said This survival in time is far from being the accidental or fortunate prolongation of an  existence originally intended only for the moment on the contrary this remanence is of the nature of the statement  oblivion and destruction are in a sense only the zero degree of this remanence And against the background that it  constitutes the operations of memory can be deployed     This analysis also presupposes that statements are treated in the form of additivity that is specific to them In   fact the types of grouping between successive statements are not always the same and they never proceed by a  simple pilingup or juxtaposition of successive elements Mathematical statements are not added to one another in  the same way as religious texts or laws they each have their own way of merging together annulling one another  excluding one another complementing one another forming groups that are in varying degrees indissociable and  endowed with unique properties Moreover these forms of additivity are not given once and for all and for a  particular category of statements medical casehistory today forms a corpus of knowledge that does not obey the  same laws of composition as medical casehistory in the eighteenth century modern mathematics does not  accumulate its statements according to the same model as Euclidean geometry     Lastly enunciative analysis presupposes that one takes phenomena of recurrence into account Every statement   involves a field of antecedent elements in relation to which it is situated but which it is able to reorganize and  redistribute according to new relations It constitutes its own past defines in what precedes it its own filiation  redefines what makes it possible or necessary excludes what cannot be compatible with it And it poses this  enunciative past as an acquired truth as an event that has occurred as a form that can be modified as material to be  transformed or as an object that can be spoken about etc In relation to all these possibilities of recurrence  memory and oblivion the rediscovery of meaning or its repression far from being fundamental are merely unique  figures   141  The description of statements and discursive formations must therefore free itself from the widespread and persistent   image of return It does not claim to go back beyond a time that is no more than a falling off a latency an oblivion a  covering up or a wandering towards that moment of foundation when speech was not yet caught up in any form of  materiality when it had no chances of survival and when it was confined to the nondetermined dimension of the  opening It does not try to constitute for the already said the paradoxical instant of the second birth it does not invoke a     dawn about to return On the contrary it deals with statements in the density of the accumulation in which they are caught  up and which nevertheless they never cease to modify to disturb to overthrow and sometimes to destroy   To describe a group of statements not as the closed plethoric totality of a meaning but as an incomplete fragmented  figure to describe a group of statements not with reference to the interiority of an intention a thought or a subject but in  accordance with the dispersion of an exteriority to describe a group of statements in order to rediscover not the moment  or the trace of their origin but the specific forms of an accumulation is certainly not to uncover an interpretation to  discover a foundation or to free constituent acts nor is it to decide on a rationality or to embrace a teleology It is to  establish what I am quite willing to call a positivity To analyse a discursive formation therefore is to deal with a group of  verbal performances at the level of the statements and of the form of positivity that characterizes them or more briefly it  is to define the type of positivity of a discourse If by substituting the analysis of rarity for the search for totalities the  description of relations of exteriority for the theme of the transcendental foundation the analysis of accumulations for the  quest of the origin one is a positivist then I am quite happy to be one Similarly I am not in the least unhappy about the  fact that several times though still in a rather blind way I have used the term positivity to designate from afar the tangled  mass that I was trying to unravel         142   5 THE HISTORICAL A PRIORI AND THE ARCHIVE  The positivity of a discourse  like that of Natural History political economy or clinical medicine  characterizes its  unity throughout time and well beyond individual oeuvres books and texts This unity certainly does not enable us to  say of Linnaeus or Buffon Quesnay or Turgot Broussais or Bichat who told the truth who reasoned with rigour who  most conformed to his own postulates nor does it enable us to say which of these oeuvres was closest to a primary or  ultimate destination which would formulate most radically the general project of a science But what it does reveal is  the extent to which Buffon and Linnaeus or Turgot and Quesnay Broussais and Bichat were talking about the same  thing by placing themselves at the same level or at the same distance by deploying the same conceptual field by  opposing one another on the same field of battle and it reveals on the other hand why one cannot say that Darwin is  talking about the same thing as Diderot that Laennec continues the work of Van Swieten or that Jevons answers the  Physiocrats It defines a limited space of communication A relatively small space since it is far from possessing the  breadth of a science with all its historical development from its most distant origin to its present stage but a more  extensive space than         143     the play of influences that have operated from one author to another or than the domain of explicit polemics Different  oeuvres dispersed books that whole mass of texts that belong to a single discursive formation  and so many authors  who know or do not know one another criticize one another invalidate one another pillage one another meet without  knowing it and obstinately intersect their unique discourses in a web of which they are not the masters of which they  cannot see the whole and of whose breadth they have a very inadequate idea  all these various figures and individuals  do not communicate solely by the logical succession of propositions that they advance nor by the recurrence of themes  nor by the obstinacy of a meaning transmitted forgotten and rediscovered they communicate by the form of positivity  of their discourse or more exactly this form of positivity and the conditions of operation of the enunciative function  defines a field in which formal identities thematic continuities translations of concepts and polemical interchanges may  be deployed Thus positivity plays the role of what might be called a historical a priori   Juxtaposed these two words produce a rather startling effect what I mean by the term is an a priori that is not a  condition of validity for judgements but a condition of reality for statements It is not a question of rediscovering what  might legitimize an assertion but of freeing the conditions of emergence of statements the law of their coexistence with  others the specific form of their mode of being the principles according to which they survive become transformed and  disappear An a priori not of truths that might never be said or really given to experience but the a priori of a history that  is given since it is that of things actually said The reason for using this rather barbarous term is that this a priori must  take account of statements in their dispersion in all the flaws opened up by their noncoherence in their overlapping and  mutual replacement in their simultaneity which is not unifiable and in their succession which is not deductible in short  it has to take account of the fact that discourse has not only a meaning or a truth but a history and a specific history that  does not refer it back to the laws of an alien development It must show for example that the history of grammar is not  the projection into the field of language and its problems of a history that is generally that of reason or of a particular  mentality a history in any case that it shares with medicine         144  mechanical sciences or theology but that it involves a type of history  a form of dispersion in time a mode of  succession of stability and of reactivation a speed of deployment or rotation  that belongs to it alone even if it is not  entirely unrelated to other types of history Moreover this a priori does not elude historicity it does not constitute above  events and in an unmoving heaven an atemporal structure it is defined as the group of rules that characterize a  discursive practice but these rules are not imposed from the outside on the elements that they relate together they are  caught up in the very things that they connect and if they are not modified with the least of them they modify them and  are transformed with them into certain decisive thresholds The a priori of positivities is not only the system of a temporal  dispersion it is itself a transformable group   Opposed to formal a prioris whose jurisdiction extends without contingence there is a purely empirical figure but on  the other hand since it makes it possible to grasp discourses in the law of their actual development it must be able to take  account of the fact that such a discourse at a given moment may accept or put into operation or on the contrary  exclude forget or ignore this or that formal structure It cannot take account by some kind of psychological or cultural  genesis of the formal a prioris but it enables us to understand how the formal a prioris may have in history points of  contact places of insertion irruption or emergence domains or occasions of operation and to understand how this  history may be not an absolutely extrinsic contingence not a necessity of form deploying its own dialectic but a specific  regularity Nothing therefore would be more pleasant or more inexact than to conceive of this historical a priori as a  formal a priori that is also endowed with a history a great unmoving empty figure that irrupted one day on the surface of  time that exercised over mens thought a tyranny that none could escape and which then suddenly disappeared in a  totally unexpected totally unprecedented eclipse a transcendental syncopation a play of intermittent forms The formal a  priori and the historical a priori neither belong to the same level nor share the same nature if they intersect it is because  they occupy two different dimensions   The domain of statements thus articulated in accordance with historical a prioris thus characterized by different types  of positivity and        145  divided up by distinct discursive formations no longer has that appearance of a monotonous endless plain that I     attributed to it at the outset when I spoke of the surface of discourse it also ceases to appear as the inert smooth  neutral element in which there arise each according to its own movement or driven by some obscure dynamic themes  ideas concepts knowledge We are now dealing with a complex volume in which heterogeneous regions are  differentiated or deployed in accordance with specific rules and practices that cannot be superposed Instead of seeing  on the great mythical book of history lines of words that translate in visible characters thoughts that were formed in  some other time and place we have in the density of discursive practices systems that establish statements as events  with their own conditions and domain of appearance and things with their own possibility and field of use They are  all these systems of statements whether events or things that I propose to call archive   By this term I do not mean the sum of all the texts that a culture has kept upon its person as documents attesting to its  own past or as evidence of a continuing identity nor do I mean the institutions which in a given society make it  possible to record and preserve those discourses that one wishes to remember and keep in circulation On the contrary it  is rather the reason why so many things said by so many men for so long have not emerged in accordance with the  same laws of thought or the same set of circumstances why they are not simply the signalization at the level of verbal  performances of what could be deployed in the order of the mind or in the order of things but they appeared by virtue  of a whole set of relations that are peculiar to the discursive level why instead of being adventitious figures grafted as  it were in a rather haphazard way on to silent processes they are born in accordance with specific regularities in short  why if there are things said  and those only  one should seek the immediate reason for them in the things that were  said not in them nor in the men that said them but in the system of discursivity in the emmciative possibilities and  impossibilites that it lays down The archive is first the law of what can be said the system that governs the appearance  of statements as unique events But the archive is also that which determines that all these things said do not accumulate  endlessly in an amorphous mass nor are they inscribed in an unbroken linearity nor        146  do they disappear at the mercy of chance external accidents but they are grouped together in distinct figures composed  together in accordance with multiple relations maintained or blurred in accordance with specific regularities that which  determines that they do not withdraw at the same pace in time but shine as it were like stars some that seem close to us  shining brightly from afar off while others that are in fact close to us are already growing pale The archive is not that  which despite its immediate escape safeguards the event of the statement and preserves for future memories its status  as an escapee it is that which at the very root of the statementevent and in that which embodies it defines at the outset  the system of its enunciability Nor is the archive that which collects the dust of statements that have become inert once  more and which may make possible the miracle of their resurrection it is that which defines the mode of occurrence of  the statementthing it is the system of its functioning Far from being that which unifies everything that has been said in  the great confused murmur of a discourse far from being only that which ensures that we exist in the midst of preserved  discourse it is that which differentiates discourses in their multiple existence and specifies them in their own duration   Between the language langue that defines the system of constructing possible sentences and the corpus that  passively collects the words that are spoken the archive defines a particular level that of a practice that causes a  multiplicity of statements to emerge as so many regular events as so many things to be dealt with and manipulated It  does not have the weight of tradition and it does not constitute the library of all libraries outside time and place nor is it  the welcoming oblivion that opens up to all new speech the operational field of its freedom between tradition and  oblivion it reveals the rules of a practice that enables statements both to survive and to undergo regular modification It is  the general system of the formation and transformation of statements   It is obvious that the archive of a society a culture or a civilization cannot be described exhaustively or even no  doubt the archive of a whole period On the other hand it is not possible for us to describe our own archive since it is  from within these rules that we speak since it is that which gives to what we can say  and to itself the object of our  discourse  its modes of appearance its forms of existence and           147     coexistence its system of accumulation historicity and disappearance The archive cannot be described in its totality  and in its presence it is unavoidable It emerges in fragments regions and levels more fully no doubt and with greater  sharpness the greater the time that separates us from it at most were it not for the rarity of the documents the greater  chronological distance would be necessary to analyse it And yet could this description of the archive be justified could it  elucidate that which makes it possible map out the place where it speaks control its rights and duties test and develop its  concepts  at least at this stage of the search when it can define its possibilities only in the moment of their realization   if it persisted in describing only the most distant horizons Should it not approach as close as possible to the positivity  that governs it and the archive system that makes it possible today to speak of the archive in general Should it not  illuminate if only in an oblique way that enunciative field of which it is itself a part The analysis of the archive then  involves a privileged region at once close to us and different from our present existence it is the border of time that  surrounds our presence which overhangs it and which indicates it in its otherness it is that which outside ourselves  delimits us The description of the archive deploys its possibilities and the mastery of its possibilities on the basis of the  very discourses that have just ceased to be ours its threshold of existence is established by the discontinuity that separates  us from what we can no longer say and from that which falls outside our discursive practice it begins with the outside of  our own language langage its locus is the gap between our own discursive practices In this sense it is valid for our  diagnosis Not because it would enable us to draw up a table of our distinctive features and to sketch out in advance the  face that we will have in the future But it deprives us of our continuities it dissipates that temporal identity in which we  are pleased to look at ourselves when we wish to exorcise the discontinuities of history it breaks the thread of  transcendental teleologies and where anthropological thought once questioned mans being or subjectivity it now bursts  open the other and the outside In this sense the diagnosis does not establish the fact of our identity by the play of  distinctions It establishes that we are difference that our reason is the difference of discourses our history the difference  of times our selves the difference of masks That difference far from        148  being the forgotten and recovered origin is this dispersion that we are and make   The never completed never wholly achieved uncovering of the archive forms the general  horizon to which the description of discursive formations the analysis of positivities the  mapping of the enunciative field belong The right of words  which is not that of the  philologists  authorizes therefore the use of the term archaeology to describe all these  searches This term does not imply the search for a beginning it does not relate analysis to  geological excavation It designates the general theme of a description that questions the already said at the level of its existence of the enunciative function that operates within it of the  discursive formation and the general archive system to which it belongs Archaeology describes  discourses as practices specified in the element of the archive   Part IV Archaeological Description  1 ARCHAEOLOGY AND THE HISTORY OF IDEAS     151   We can now reverse the procedure we can go downstream and once we have covered the domain of discursive  formations and statements once we have outlined their general theory we can proceed to possible domains of     application We can examine what use is served by this analysis that I have rather solemnly called archaeology Indeed  we must for to be frank as they are at the moment things are rather disturbing I set out with a relatively simple  problem the division of discourse into great unities that were not those of oeuvres authors books or themes And with  the sole purpose of establishing them I have set about constructing a whole series of notions discursive formations  positivity archive I have defined a domain statements the enunciative field discursive practices I have tried to  reveal the specificity of a method that is neither formalizing nor interpretative in short I have appealed to a whole  apparatus whose sheer weight and no doubt somewhat bizarre machinery are a source of embarrassment For two or  three reasons there exist already enough methods for describing and analysing language langage for it not to be  presumptuous to wish to add another And anyway I was suspicious of such unities of discourse as the book and the  oeuvre because I suspected         152   them of not being as immediate and selfevident as they appeared is it reasonable to replace them by unities that one has  established with so much effort after so much groping and in accordance with principles so obscure that it has taken  hundreds of pages to elucidate them And are the things that all these instruments finally delimit those discourses  whose identity they map out the same as those figures called psychiatry or political economy or Natural History  for which I empirically set out and which have provided me with a pretext for developing this strange arsenal It is now  of the utmost importance that I should measure the descriptive efficacy of the notions that I have tried to define I must  discover whether the machine works and what it can produce What then can this archaeology offer that other descrip tions are unable to provide What are the rewards for such a heavy enterprise   And now a suspicion occurs to me I have behaved as if I were discovering a new domain as if in order to chart it I  needed new measurements and guidelines But in fact was I not all the time in that very space that has long been  known as the history of ideas Was it not to that space that I was implicitly referring even when on two or three  occasions I tried to keep my distance And if I had not forced myself to turn away from it would I not have found in it  already prepared already analysed all that I was looking for Perhaps I am a historian of ideas after all But an ashamed  or if you prefer a presumptuous historian of ideas One who set out to renew his discipline from top to bottom who  wanted no doubt to achieve a rigour that so many other similar descriptions have recently acquired but who unable to  modify in any real way that old form of analysis to make it cross the threshold of scientificity or finding that such a  metamorphosis is always impossible or that he did not have the strength to effect that transformation himself declares  that he had been doing and wanted to do something quite different All this new fog just to hide what remained in the  same landscape fixed to an old patch of ground cultivated to the point of exhaustion I cannot be satisfied until I have  cut myself off from the history of ideas until I have shown in what way archaeological analysis differs from the  descriptions of the history of ideas   It is not easy to characterize a discipline like the history of ideas it is           153   an uncertain object with badly drawn frontiers methods borrowed from here and there and an approach lacking in  rigour and stability And it seems to possess two roles On the one hand it recounts the byways and margins of history  Not the history of the sciences but that of imperfect illbased knowledge which could never in the whole of its long  persistent life attain the form of scientificity the history of alchemy rather than chemistry of animal spirits or phrenology  rather than physiology the history of atomistic themes rather than physics The history of those shady philosophies that  haunt literature art the sciences law ethics and even mans daily life the history of those ageold themes that are never  crystallized in a rigorous and individual system but which have formed the spontaneous philosophy of those who did not     philosophize The history not of literature but of that tangential rumour that everyday transient writing that never  acquires the status of an oeuvre or is immediately lost the analysis of subliteratures almanacs reviews and newpapers  temporary successes anonymous authors Thus defined  but one can see at once how difficult it is to fix precise limits  for it  the history of ideas is concerned with all that insidious thought that whole interplay of representations that flow  anonymously between men in the interstices of the great discursive monuments it reveals the crumbling soil on which  they are based It is the discipline of fluctuating languages langages of shapeless works of unrelated themes The  analysis of opinions rather than of knowledge of errors rather than of truth of types of mentality rather than of forms of  thought   But on the other hand the history of ideas sets out to cross the boundaries of existing disciplines to deal with them  from the outside and to reinterpret them Rather than a marginal domain then it constitutes a style of analysis a putting  into perspective It takes account of the historical field of the sciences of literature of philosophy but it describes the  knowledge that has served as an empirical unreflective basis for subsequent formalizations it tries to rediscover the  immediate experience that discourse transcribes it follows the genesis which on the basis of received or acquired  representations gives birth to systems and ceuvres It shows on the other hand how the great figures that are built up in  this way gradually decompose how the themes fall apart pursue their isolated lives fall into disuse or are recomposed in  a new         154  way The history of ideas then is the discipline of beginnings and ends the description of obscure continuities and  returns the reconstitution of developments in the linear form of history But it can also by that very fact describe from  one domain to another the whole interplay of exchanges and intermediaries it shows how scientific knowledge is  diffused gives rise to philosophical concepts and takes form perhaps in literary works it shows how problems notions  themes may emigrate from the philosophical field where they were formulated to scientific or political discourses it  relates work with institutions social customs or behaviour techniques and unrecorded needs and practices it tries to  revive the most elaborate forms of discourse in the concrete landscape in the midst of the growth and development that  witnessed their birth It becomes therefore the discipline of interferences the description of the concentric circles that  surround works underline them relate them to one another and insert them into whatever they are not   It is clear how these two roles of the history of ideas are articulated one upon the other In its most general form it can  be said that it continually describes  and in all the directions in which it operates  the transition from nonphilosophy  to philosophy from nonscientificity to science from nonliterature to the uvre itself It is the analysis of silent births or  distant correspondences of permanences that persist beneath apparent changes of slow formations that profit from  innumerable blind complicities of those total figures that gradually come together and suddenly condense into the fine  point of the work Genesis continuity totalization these are the great themes of the history of ideas and that by which it  is attached to a certain now traditional form of historical analysis In these conditions it is normal that anyone who still  practises history its methods its requirements and possibilities  this now rather shopsoiled idea  cannot conceive  that a discipline like the history of ideas should be abandoned or rather considers that any other form of analysing  discourses is a betrayal of history itself But archaeological description is precisely such an abandonment of the history of  ideas a systematic rejection of its postulates and procedures an attempt to practise a quite different history of what men  have said That some people do not recognize in this enterprise the history of their        155  childhood that they mourn its passing and continue to invoke in an age that is no longer made for it that great shade of  former times certainly proves their fidelity But such conservative zeal confirms me in my purpose and gives me the  confidence to do what I set out to do   Between archaeological analysis and the history of ideas there are a great many points of divergence I shall try shortly  to establish four differences that seem to me to be of the utmost importance They concern the attribution of innovation  the analysis of contradictions comparative descriptions and the mapping of transformations I hope that by examining     these different points we will be able to grasp the specific qualities of archaeological analysis and that we may be able to  measure its descriptive capacity For the moment however I should like to lay down a few principles     1Archaeology tries to define not the thoughts representations images themes preoccupations that are concealed  or revealed in discourses but those discourses themselves those discourses as practices obeying certain rules It does  not treat discourse as document as a sign of something else as an element that ought to be transparent but whose  unfortunate opacity must often be pierced if one is to reach at last the depth of the essential in the place in which it is  held in reserve it is concerned with discourse in its own volume as a monument It is not an interpretative discipline  it does not seek another betterhidden discourse It refuses to be allegorical     2Archaeology does not seek to rediscover the continuous insensible transition that relates discourses on a gentle   slope to what precedes them surrounds them or follows them It does not await the moment when on the basis of  what they were not yet they became what they are nor the moment when the solidity of their figure crumbling away  they will gradually lose their identity On the contrary its problem is to define discourses in their specificity to show  in what way the set of rules that they put into operation is irreducible to any other to follow them the whole length of  their exterior ridges in order to underline them the better It does not proceed in slow progression from the confused  field of opinion to the uniqueness of the        156  system or the definitive stability of science it is not a doxology but a differential analysis of the modalities of  discourse   3Archaeology is not ordered in accordance with the sovereign figure of the oeuvres it does not try to grasp the  moment in which the oeuvre emerges on the anonymous horizon It does not wish to rediscover the enigmatic point at  which the individual and the social are inverted into one another It is neither a psychology nor a sociology nor more  generally an anthropology of creation The oeuvre is not for archaeology a relevant division even if it is a matter of  replacing it in its total context or in the network of causalities that support it It defines types of rules for discursive  practices that run through individual oeuvres sometimes govern them entirely and dominate them to such an extent  that nothing eludes them but which sometimes too govern only part of it The authority of the creative subject as  the raison detre of an oeuvre and the principle of its unity is quite alien to it   4Lastly archaeology does not try to restore what has been thought wished aimed at experienced desired by men  in the very moment at which they expressed it in discourse it does not set out to recapture that elusive nucleus in  which the author and the oeuvre exchange identities in which thought still remains nearest to oneself in the as yet  unaltered form of the same and in which language langage has not yet been deployed in the spatial successive  dispersion of discourse In other words it does not try to repeat what has been said by reaching it in its very identity  It does not claim to efface itself in the ambiguous modesty of a reading that would bring back in all its purity the  distant precarious almost effaced light of the origin It is nothing more than a rewriting that is in the preserved form  of exteriority a regulated transformation of what has already been written It is not a return to the innermost secret of  the origin it is the systematic description of a discourseobject         157   2 THE ORIGINAL And THE REGULAR   In general the history of ideas deals with the field of discourses as a domain with two values any element located there  may be characterized as old or new traditional or original conforming to an average type or deviant One can  distinguish therefore between two categories of formulation those that are highly valued and relatively rare which  appear for the first time which have no similar antecedents which may serve as models for others and which to this  extent deserve to be regarded as creations and those ordinary everyday solid that are not responsible for themselves     and which derive sometimes going so far as to repeat it word for word from what has already been said To each of  these two groups the history of ideas gives a status and it does not subject them to the same analysis in describing the  first it recounts the history of inventions changes transformations it shows how truth freed itself from error how  consciousness awoke from its successive slumbers how new forms rose up in turn to produce the landscape that we  know today it is the task of the historian to rediscover on the basis of these isolated points these successive ruptures the  continuous line of an evolution The second group on the other hand reveals history as inertia and weight as a slow  accumulation of the past a silent        158  sedimentation of things said in this second group statements must he treated by weight and in accordance with what  they have in common their unique occurrence may be neutralized the importance of their authors identity the time and  place of their appearance are also diminished on the other hand it is their extent that must be measured the extent of  their repetition in time and place the channels by which they are diffused the groups in which they circulate the general  horizon that they outline for mens thought the limits that they impose on it and how in characterizing a period they  make it possible to distinguish it from others one then describes a series of overall figures In the first case the history  of ideas describes a succession of events in thought in the second there are uninterrupted expanses of effects in the  first one reconstitutes the emergence of truths of forms in the second one reestablishes forgotten solidities and refers  discourses to their relativity   It is true that between these two authorities the history of ideas is continuously determining relations neither  analysis is ever found in its pure state it describes conflicts between the old and the new the resistance of the acquired  the repression that it exercises over what has so far never been said the coverings by which it masks it the oblivion to  which it sometimes succeeds in confining it but it also describes the conditions which obscurely and at a distance will  facilitate the emergence of future discourses it describes the repercussions of discoveries the speed and extent of their  diffusion the slow processes of replacement or the sudden upheavals that overthrow familiar language langage it  describes the integration of the new in the already structured field of the acquired the progressive fall from the original  into the traditional or again the reappearances of the alreadysaid and the uncovering of the original But this  intersection does not prevent it from always maintaining a bipolar analysis of the old and the new An analysis that  reinvests in the empirical element of history and in each of its stages the problematic of the origin in every uvre in  every hook in the smallest text the problem is to rediscover the point of rupture to establish with the greatest possible  precision the division between the implicit density of the alreadysaid a perhaps involuntary fidelity to acquired  opinion the law of discursive fatalities and the vivacity of creation the leap into irreducible difference Although this  description      159   of originalities may seem obvious enough it poses two very different methodological problems that of resemblance and  that of procession It presupposes in effect that one can establish a sort of single great series in which every  formulation would assume a date in accordance with homogeneous chronological guidelines But to examine the  question more closely does Grimm with his law of vowelgradations precede Bopp who quoted him used him  applied and modified what he said in the same way and on the same temporal line and did Cceurdoux and Anquetil Duperron in observing analogies between Greek and Sanskrit anticipate the definition of the IndoEuropean languages  and precede the founders of comparative grammar Was Saussure preceded by Peirce and his semiotics by Arnauld  and Lancelot with the Classical analysis of the sign and by the Stoics and the theory of the signifier in the same series  and in accordance with the same mode of anteriority Precession is not an irreducible and primary donnee it cannot play  the role of an absolute measure that makes it possible to gauge all discourse and to distinguish the original from the  repetitive The mapping of antecedents is not enough in itself to determine a discursive order on the contrary it is  subordinated to the discourse that one is analysing at the level that one chooses on the scale that one establishes By  deploying discourse throughout a calendar and by giving a date to each of its elements one does not obtain a definitive  hierarchy of precessions and originalities this hierarchy is never more than relative to the systems of discourse that it  sets out to evaluate   Similarly the resemblance between two or several successive formulations also poses a whole series of problems In  what sense and in accordance with what criteria can one affirm this has been said the same thing can already he found  in this or that text etc What is identity partial or total in the order of discourse The fact that two enunciations are  exactly identical that they are made up of the same words used with the same meaning does not as we know mean that     they are absolutely identical Even when one finds in the work of Diderot and Lamarck or of Benoit de Maillet and  Darwin the same formulation of the principle of evolution one cannot consider that one is dealing in each case with the  same discursive event which has been subjected at different times to a series of repetitions Identity is not a   160   criterion even when it is exhaustive even less so when it is partial when words are not used each time in the same sense  or when the same nucleus of meaning is apprehended through different words to what extent can one affirm that it is the  same organicist theme that emerges in the so very different discourses and vocabularies of Buffon Jussieu and Cuvier  And inversely can one say that the word organization has the same meaning in the work of Daubenton Blumenbach  and Geoffroy SaintHilaire Generally speaking does one find the same type of resemblance between Cuvier and  Darwin and between Cuvier and Linnaeus or Aristotle There is no immediately recognizable resemblance between the  formulations their analogy is an effect of the discursive field in which it is mapped   It is not legitimate then to demand pointblank of the texts that one is studying their title to originality and whether  they really possess those degrees of nobility that are measured here by the absence of ancestors The question can have  meaning only in very precisely defined series in groups whose limits and domain have been established between guide lines that delimit sufficiently homogeneous discursive fields But to seek in the great accumulation of the alreadysaid  the text that resembles in advance a later text to ransack history in order to rediscover the play of anticipations or  echoes to go right back to the first seeds or to go forward to the last traces to reveal in a work its fidelity to tradition or  its irreducible uniqueness to raise or lower its stock of originality to say that the PortRoyal grammarians invented  nothing or to discover that Cuvier had more predecessors than one thought these are harmless enough amusements for  historians who refuse to grow up   Archaeological description is concerned with those discursive practices to which the facts of succession must be  referred if one is not to establish them in an unsystematic and naive way that is in terms of merit At the level in which  they are the originalitybanality opposition is therefore not relevant between an initial formulation and the sentence  which years centuries later repeats it more or less exactly it establishes no hierarchy of value it makes no radical  difference It tries   It was in this way that M Canguilhem established the series of propositions which from Willis to Prochaska made possible the definition of the reflex   161     only to establish the regularity of statements In this sense regularity is not in opposition to irregularity which in the  margins of current opinion or the most frequent texts characterizes the deviant statement abnormal prophetic retarded  pathological or the product of genius it designates for every verbal performance extraordinary or banal unique in its  own kind or endlessly repeated the set of conditions in which the enunciative function operates and which guarantees  and defines its existence In this sense regularity does not characterize a certain central position between the ends of a  statistical curve  it is not valid therefore as an index of frequency or probability it specifies an effective field of  appearance Every statement bears a certain regularity and it cannot be dissociated from it One must not therefore  oppose the regularity of a statement with the irregularity of another that may he less expected more unique richer in  innovation but to other regularities that characterize other statements   Archaeology is not in search of inventions and it remains unmoved at the moment a very moving one I admit when  for the first time someone was sure of some truth it does not try to restore the light of those joyful mornings But neither  is it concerned with the average phenomena of opinion with the dull grey of what everyone at a particular period might  repeat What it seeks in the texts of Linnaeus or Buffon Petty or Ricardo Pinel or Bichat is not to draw up a list of  founding saints it is to uncover the regularity of a discursive practice A practice that is in operation in the same way in  the work of their predecessors a practice that takes account in their work not only of the most original affirmations  those that no one else dreamt of before them but also of those that they borrowed even copied from their  predecessors A discovery is no less regular from the enunciative point of view than the text that repeats and diffuses  it regularity is no less operant no less effective and active in a banal as in a unique formation In such a description  one cannot admit a difference in nature between creative statements which reveal something new which emit hitherto  unknown information and which are active in the same way and imitative statements which receive and repeat  information and remain as it were passive The field of statements is not a group of inert areas broken up by fecund  moments it is a domain that is active throughout   162   This analysis of enunciative regularities opens up in several directions that one day perhaps will be explored with  greater care     1 A group of statements is characterized then by a certain form of regularity without it being either necessary or  possible to distinguish between what is new and what is not But these regularities  we shall come hack to them later   are not given once and for all the same regularity is not to be found at work in Tournefort and Darwin Lancelot and  Saussure Petty and Keynes There are then homogeneous fields of enunciative regularities they characterize a  discursive formation but these fields are different from one another The movement from one field of enunciative  regularities to another need not be accompanied by corresponding changes at all other levels of discourse There are  verbal performances that are identical from the point of view of grammar vocabulary syntax and the language langue  in general that are also identical from the point of view of logic from the point of view of propositional structure or of  the deductive system in which it is placed  but which are enunciatively different Thus the formation of the quantitative  relation between prices and monetary mass in circulation may be expressed in the same words  or synonymous words   and be obtained by the same reasoning but it is not enunciatively identical in Gresham or Locke and the nineteenth century marginalists it does not belong in each case to the same system of formation of objects and concepts We must  distinguish then between linguistic analogy or translatability logical identity or equivalence and enunciative  homogeneity It is with these homogeneities and these alone that archaeology is concerned It can see the appearance of a  new discursive practice through verbal formulations that remain linguistically analogous or logically equivalent by  taking up again sometimes word for word the old theory of sentenceattribution and verbcopula the PortRoyal  grammarians opened up an enunciative regularity whose specificity it is the duty of archaeology to describe Inversely it  may ignore differences of vocabulary it may pass over semantic fields or different deductive organizations if it is  capable of recognizing in each case despite their heterogeneity a certain enunciative regularity from this point of view  the theory of the language langage of action the search for the origin of languages longues the establishment of  primitive   163     roots as they are found in the eighteenth century are not new in relation to Lancelots logical analyses  One can see the emergence therefore of a number of disconnexions and articulations One can no longer say that a   discovery the formulation of a general principle or the definition of a project inaugurates in a massive way a new  phase in the history of discourse One no longer has to seek that point of absolute origin or total revolution on the basis of  which everything is organized everything becomes possible and necessary everything is effaced in order to begin again  One is dealing with events of different types and levels caught up in distinct historical webs the establishment of an  enunciative homogeneity in no way implies that for decades or centuries to come men will say and think the same thing  nor does it imply the definition explicit or not of a number of principles from which everything else would flow as  inevitable consequences Enunciative homogeneities and heterogeneities intersect with linguistic continuities and  changes with logical identities and differences without any of them proceeding at the same pace or necessarily  affecting one another But there must exist between them a number of relations and interdependences whose no doubt  highly complex domain must be described     2 Another direction of research the interior hierarchies within enunciative regularities We have seen that every  statement belongs to a certain regularity  that consequently none can be regarded as pure creation as the marvellous  disorder of genius But we have also seen that no statement can be regarded as inactive and be valid as the scarcely real  shadow or transfer of the initial statement The whole enunciative field is both regular and alerted it never sleeps the  least statement  the most discreet or the most banal  puts into operation a whole set of rules in accordance with which  its object its modality the concepts that it employs and the strategy of which it is a part are formed These rules are  never given in a formulation they traverse formulations and set up for them a space of coexistence one cannot therefore  rediscover the unique statement that would articulate them for themselves However certain groups of statements put  these rules into operation in their most general and most widely applicable form     164   using them as a startingpoint one can see how other objects other concepts other enunciative modalities or other  strategic choices may be formed on the basis of rules that are less general and whose domain of application is more  specified One can thus describe a tree of enunciative derivation at its base are the statements that put into operation rules  of formation in their most extended form at its summit and after a number of branchings are the statements that put into  operation the same regularity but one more delicately articulated more clearly delimited and localized in its extension   Archaeology  and this is one of its principal themes  may thus constitute the tree of derivation of a discourse That  of Natural History for example It will place at the root as governing statements those that concern the definition of  observable structures and the field of possible objects those that prescribe the forms of description and the perceptual  codes that it can use those that reveal the most general possibilities of characterization and thus open up a whole domain  of concepts to be constructed and lastly those that while constituting a strategic choice leave room for the greatest  number of subsequent options And it will find at the ends of the branches or at various places in the whole a  burgeoning of discoveries like that of fossil series conceptual transformations like the new definition of the genus  the emergence of new notions like that of mammals or organism technical improvements principles for organizing  collections methods of classification and nomenclature This derivation from governing statements must not be confused  with a deduction that is made on the basis of axioms nor must it be identified with the germination of a general idea or a  philosophical nucleus whose significance emerges gradually in experience or precise conceptualizations lastly it must  not he taken as a psychological genesis based on a discovery whose consequences and possibilities gradually develop and  unfold It is different from all these courses and it must be described in its autonomy One can thus describe the  archaeological derivations of Natural History without beginning with its undemonstrable axioms or its fundamental  themes the continuity of nature for example and without taking as ones startingpoint and guidingthread the first dis coveries or the first approaches those of Tournefort before those of Linnaeus those of Jonston before those of  Tournefort The archaeo     165   logical order is neither that of systematici ties nor that of chronological successions  But one can see that a whole domain of possible questions is opening up here For these different   orders cannot be specific and autonomous there must be relations and dependences between them  For certain discursive formations the archaeological order is perhaps not very different from the  systematic order as in other cases it may follow the thread of chronological successions These  parallelisms contrary to the distortions met with elsewhere are worthy of analysis In any case it is  important not to confuse these different orders not to seek in an initial discovery or in the  originality of a formulation the principle from which everything can be deduced and derived not to  seek in a general principle the law of enunciative regularities or individual inventions not to demand  of archaeological derivation that it reproduce the order of time or reveal a deductive schema     Nothing would be more false than to see in the analysis of discursive formations an attempt at   totalitarian periodization whereby from a certain moment and for a certain time everyone would     think in the same way in spite of surface differences say the same thing through a polymorphous  vocabulary and produce a sort of great discourse that one could travel over in any direction On the  contrary archaeology describes a level of enunciative homogeneity that has its own temporal  articulations and which does not carry with it all the other forms of identity and difference that are  to be found in language and at this level it establishes an order hierarchies a whole burgeoning  that excludes a massive amorphous synchrony given totally once and for all In those confused  unities that we call periods it reveals with all their specificity enunciative periods that are  articulated but without being confused with them upon the time of concepts on theoretical phases  on stages of formalization and of linguistic development       166   3 CONTRADICTIONS   The history of ideas usually credits the discourse that it analyses with coherence If it happens to notice an irregularity in  the use of words several incompatible propositions a set of meanings that do not adjust to one another concepts that  cannot be systematized together then it regards it as its duty to find at a deeper level a principle of cohesion that  organizes the discourse and restores to it its hidden unity This law of coherence is a heuristic rule a procedural  obligation almost a moral constraint of research not to multiply contradictions uselessly not to be taken in by small  differences not to give too much weight to changes disavowals returns to the past and polemics not to suppose that  mens discourse is perpetually undermined from within by the contradiction of their desires the influences that they have  been subjected to or the conditions in which they live but to admit that if they speak and if they speak among  themselves it is rather to overcome these contradictions and to find the point from which they will be able to be  mastered But this same coherence is also the result of research it defines the terminal unities that complete the analysis  it discovers the internal organization of a text the form of development of an individual oeuvre or the meetingplace of  different discourses In order to reconstitute it it must first be presupposed and one will only be sure of finding it if one  has pursued it far enough and for long enough It   167   appears as an optimum the greatest possible number of contradictions resolved by the simplest means  But a great many means are used and by that very fact the coherences found may differ considerably By analysing     the truth of propositions and the relations that unite them one can define a field of logical noncontradiction one will  then discover a systematicity one will rise from the visible body of sentences to that pure ideal architecture that the  ambiguities of grammar and the overloading of words with meanings have probably concealed as much as expressed But  one can adopt the contrary course and by following the thread of analogies and symbols rediscover a thematic that is  more imaginary than discursive more affective than rational and less close to the concept than to desire its force  animates the most opposed figures but only to melt them at once into a slowly transformable unity what one then dis covers is a plastic continuity the movement of a meaning that is embodied in various representations images and  metaphors These coherences may be thematic or systematic explicit or not they can be sought at the level of  representations that were conscious in the speaking subject but which his discourse  for circumstantial reasons or  because of an inadequacy in the very form of his language langage  failed to express it can also be sought in  structures that would have constrained the author the more he constructed them and which would have imposed on him  without his realizing it postulates operational schemata linguistic rules a set of affirmations and fundamental beliefs  types of images or a whole logic of the fantastic Lastly there are coherences that one establishes at the level of an  individual  his biography or the unique circumstances of his discourse  but one can also establish them in  accordance with broader guidelines one can give them the collective diachronic dimensions of a period a genera form  of consciousness a type of society a set of traditions an imaginary landscape common to a whole culture In all these  forms a coherence discovered in this way always plays the same role it shows that immediately visible contradictions  are merely surface reflections and that this play of dispersed light must be concentrated into a single focus Contradiction  is the illusion of a unity that hides itself or is hidden it has its place only in the gap between consciousness and  unconsciousness thought and the text the ideality and the contingent   168  body of expression In any case analysis must suppress contradiction as best it can   At the end of this work only residual contradictions remain  accidents defects mistakes  or on the contrary as if  the entire analysis had been carried out in secrecy and in spite of itself the fundamental contradiction emerges the  bringing into play at the very origin of the system of incompatible postulates intersections of irreconcilable influences  the first diffraction of desire the economic and political conflict that opposes a society to itself all this instead of  appearing as so many superficial elements that must be reduced is finally revealed as an organizing principle as the  founding secret law that accounts for all minor contradictions and gives them a firm foundation in short a model for all  the other oppositions Such a contradiction far from being an appearance or accident of discourse far from being that  from which it must be freed if its truth is at last to be revealed constitutes the very law of its existence it is on the basis  of such a contradiction that discourse emerges and it is in order both to translate it and to overcome it that discourse  begins to speak it is in order to escape that contradiction whereas contradiction is ceaselessly reborn through discourse  that discourse endlessly pursues itself and endlessly begins again it is because contradiction is always anterior to the  discourse and because it can never therefore entirely escape it that discourse changes undergoes transformation and  escapes of itself from its own continuity Contradiction then functions throughout discourse as the principle of its  historicity   The history of ideas recognizes therefore two levels of contradiction that of appearances which is resolved in the  profound unity of discourse and that of foundations which gives rise to discourse itself In relation to the first level of  contradiction discourse is the ideal figure that must be separated from their accidental presence from their too visible  body in relation to the second discourse is the empirical figure that contradictions may take up and whose apparent  cohesion must be destroyed in order to rediscover them at last in their irruption and violence Discourse is the path from  one contradiction to another if it gives rise to those that can be seen it is because it obeys that which it hides To analyse  discourse is to hide and reveal contradictions it is to show the play that they set up within it it is to manifest        169  how it can express them embody them or give them a temporary appearance   For archaeological analysis contradictions are neither appearances to be overcome nor secret principles to be  uncovered They are objects to be described for themselves without any attempt being made to discover from what point  of view they can be dissipated or at what level they can be radicalized and effects become causes Let us take a simple  example one that has already been mentioned several times in the eighteenth century Linnaeuss fixist principle was  contradicted not so much by the discovery of the Peloria which changed only its modes of application but by a number  of evolutionist affirmations that are to be found in the works of Buffon Diderot Bordeu Maillet and many others  Archaeological analysis does not consist in showing that beneath this opposition at a more essential level everyone  accepted a number of fundamental theses the continuity and plenitude of nature the correlation between recent forms  and climate the almost imperceptible transition from the nonliving to the living nor does it consist in showing that such  an opposition reflects in the particular domain of Natural History a more general conflict that divides all eighteenth century knowledge and thought the conflict between the theme of an ordered creation acquired once and for all     deployed without irreducible secret and the theme of a prolific nature endowed with enigmatic powers gradually  deploying itself through history and overturning all spatial orders in obedience to the onward thrust of time  Archaeology tries to show how the two affirmations fixist and evolutionist share a common locus in a certain  description of species and genera this description takes as its object the visible structure of organs that is their form  size number and arrangement in space and it can limit that object in two ways to the organism as a whole or to certain  elements determined either by importance or by taxonomic convenience one then reveals in the second case a regular  table containing a number of definite squares that in a way constitutes the programme of all possible creation so that  whether present still to come or already disappeared the ordering of the species and genera is definitively fixed  and in  the first case groups of kinship that remain indefinite and open that are separated from one another and that tolerate an  indeterminate number of new forms however close they        170  may be to preexisting forms By deriving in this way the contradiction between two theses from a certain domain of  objects from its delimitations and divisions one does not discover a point of conciliation But neither does one transfer  it to a more fundamental level one defines the locus in which it takes place it reveals the place where the two branches  of the alternative join it localizes the divergence and the place where the two discourses are juxtaposed The theory of  structure is not a common postulate a basis of general belief shared by Linnaeus and Buffon a solid fundamental  affirmation that throws back to the level of a subsidiary debate the conflict of evolutionism and fixism it is the principle  of their incompatibility the law that governs their derivation and their coexistence By taking contradictions as objects to  be described archaeological analysis does not try to discover in their place a common form or theme it tries to  determine the extent and form of the gap that separates them In relation to a history of ideas that attempts to melt  contradictions in the seminocturnal unity of an overall figure or which attempts to transmute them into a general ab stract uniform principle of interpretation or explanation archaeology describes the different spaces of dissension   It ceases therefore to treat contradictions as a general function operating in the same way at all levels of discourse  and which analysis should either suppress entirely or lead back to a primary constitutive form for the great game of  contradiction  present under innumerable guises then suppressed and finally restored in the major conflict in which it  culminates  it substitutes the analysis of different types of contradiction different levels in accordance with which it  can be mapped different functions that it can exercise   Different types first of all Some contradictions are localized only at the level of propositions and assertions without  in any way affecting the body of enunciative rules that makes them possible thus in the eighteenth century the thesis of  the animal character of fossils was opposed by the more traditional thesis of their mineral nature the consequences that  can be drawn from these two theses are certainly very numerous and farreaching but it can be shown that they  originated in the same discursive formation at the same point and in accordance with the same conditions of operation  of the enunciative function they are contradictions that are archaeologically derived and   171  which constitute a terminal state Others on the contrary go beyond the bounds of a discursive formation and they  oppose theses that do not belong to the same conditions of enunciation thus Linnaeuss fixism is contradicted by  Darwins evolutionism but only to the extent that one neutralizes the difference between Natural History to which the  first belongs and biology to which the second belongs They are extrinsic contradictions that reflect the opposition  between distinct discursive formations For archaeological description ignoring for the moment any possible  procedural differences this opposition constitutes the terminus a quo whereas derived contradictions constitute the  terminus ad quem of analysis Between these two extremes archaeological description describes what might be called  intrinsic contradictions those that are deployed in the discursive formation itself and which originating at one point in  the system of formations reveal subsystems hence to keep to the example of eighteenthcentury Natural History the  contradiction between methodical analyses and systematic analyses The opposition here is not a terminal one they are  not two contradictory propositions about the same object they are not two incompatible uses of the same concept but  two ways of forming statements both characterized by certain objects certain positions of subjectivity certain concepts  and certain strategic choices Yet these systems are not primary ones for it can be shown to what extent they both derive  from a single positivity that of Natural History It is these intrinsic oppositions that are relevant to archaeological  analysis   Then different levels An intrinsic archaeological contradiction is not a fact purely and simply that it is enough to  state as a principle or explain as an effect It is a complex phenomenon that is distributed over different levels of the  discursive formation Thus for systematic Natural History and methodical Natural History which were in constant  opposition for a good part of the eighteenth century one can recognize an inadequation of the objects in the one case  one describes the general appearance of the plant in the other certain predetermined variables in the one case one  describes the totality of the plant or at least its most important parts in the other one describes a number of elements  chosen arbitrarily for their taxonomic convenience sometimes one takes account of the plants different states of growth  and maturity at others one confines ones attention to a single moment a          172   stage of optimum visibility a divergence of enunciative modalities in the case of the systematic analysis of plants one  applies a rigorous perceptual and linguistic code and in accordance with a constant scale for methodical description the  codes are relatively free and the scales of mapping may oscillate an incompatibility of concepts in the systems the  concept of generic character is an arbitrary though misleading mark to designate the genera in the methods this same  concept must include the real definition of the genus lastly an exclusion of theoretical options systematic taxonomy  makes fixism possible even if it is rectified by the idea of a continuous creation in time gradually unfolding the  elements of the tables or by the idea of natural catastrophes having disturbed by our present gaze the linear order of  natural proximities but excludes the possibility of a transformation that the method accepts without absolutely implying  it   Functions These forms of opposition do not all play the same role in discursive practice they are not in a  homogeneous way obstacles to overcome or a principle of growth In any case it is not enough to seek in them the cause  either of the deceleration or the acceleration of history time is not introduced into the truth and ideality of discourse on  the basis of the empty general form of opposition These oppositions are always particular functional stages Some of  them bring about an additional development of the enunciative field they open up sequences of argumentation  experiment verification and various inferences they make possible the determination of new objects they arouse new  enunciative modalities they define new concepts or modify the field of application of those that already exist but without  anything being modified in the system of positivity of the discourse this was the case in the discussions of the  eighteenthcentury naturalists on the frontier between the mineral and the vegetal or on the boundaries of life or nature  and the origin of fossils such additive processes may remain decisively open or closed by a demonstration that refutes  them or a discovery that puts them out of operation Others induce a reorganization of the discursive field they pose the  question of the possible translation of one group of statements into another of the point of coherence that might articulate  one on another of their integration in a more general space thus the systemmethod opposition among eighteenthcentury  naturalists induces a series of attempts to recreate both of them in a   173  single form of description to give to the method the rigour and regularity of the system to coincide the arbitrariness of  the system with the concrete analyses of the method they are not new objects new concepts new enunciative modalities  that are added in a linear fashion to the old but objects of another more general or more particular level concepts that  have another structure and another field of application enunciations of another type without however altering the rules  of formation Other oppositions play a critical role they put into operation the existence of the acceptability of the  discursive practice they define the point of its effective impossibility and of its historical reflexion thus the description  in Natural History itself of organic similarities and functions that operate through anatomical variables in definite  conditions of existence no longer permits as an autonomous discursive formation at least a Natural History that is a  taxonomic science of beings on the basis of their visible characters   A discursive formation is not therefore an ideal continuous smooth text that runs beneath the multiplicity of  contradictions and resolves them in the calm unity of coherent thought nor is it the surface in which in a thousand  different aspects a contradiction is reflected that is always in retreat but everywhere dominant It is rather a space of  multiple dissensions a set of different oppositions whose levels and roles must be described Archaeological analysis  then erects the primacy of a contradiction that has its model in the simultaneous affirmation and negation of a single  proposition But the reason for this is not to even out oppositions in the general forms of thought and to pacify them by  force by a recourse to a constructing a priori On the contrary its purpose is to map in a particular discursive practice  the point at which they are constituted to define the form that they assume the relations that they have with each other  and the domain that they govern In short its purpose is to maintain discourse in all its many irregularities and  consequently to suppress the theme of a contradiction uniformly lost and rediscovered resolved and forever rising again  in the undifferentiated element of the Logos     174       4 THE COMPARATIVE FACTS  Archaeological analysis individualizes and describes discursive formations That is it must compare them oppose them     to one another in the simultaneity in which they are presented distinguish them from those that do not belong to the  same timescale relate them on the basis of their specificity to the nondiscursive practices that surround them and  serve as a general element for them In this too they are very different from epistemological or architectonic  descriptions which analyse the internal structure of a theory archaeological study is always in the plural it operates in a  great number of registers it crosses interstices and gaps it has its domain where unities are juxtaposed separated fix  their crests confront one another and accentuate the whitespaces between one another When it is concerned with a  particular type of discourse that of psychiatry in Madness and Civilization or that of medicine in Naissance de la  clinique it is in order to establish by comparison its chronological limits it is also in order to describe at the same  time as them and in correlation with them an institutional field a set of events practices and political decisions a  sequence of economic processes that also involve demographic fluctuations techniques of public assistance manpower  needs different levels of unemployment etc But it may also by a sort of lateral rapprochement as in The Order of  Things put into operation several distinct positivities        175  whose concomitant states are compared during a particular period and which are confronted with other types of discourse  that have taken place at a given period   But all these analyses are very different from those usually practised     1 In archaeological analysis comparison is always limited and regional Far from wishing to reveal general forms  archaeology tries to outline particular configurations When one compares General Grammar the Analysis of Wealth  and Natural History in the Classical period it is not in order to regroup three manifestations  particularly charged with  expressive value and hitherto strangely neglected  of a mentality that was general in the seventeenth and eighteenth  centuries it is not in order to reconstitute on the basis of a reduced model and a particular domain the forms of  rationality that operated in the whole of Classical science it is not even to illuminate the less wellknown profile of what  we thought was a familiar cultural face Our aim was not to show that men in the eighteenth century were generally  speaking more interested in order than in history in classification than development in signs than the mechanisms of  causality Our aim was to reveal a welldetermined set of discursive formations that have a number of describable  relations between them These relations do not spill over into adjacent domains and they cannot be brought gradually  closer to the totality of contemporary discourses even less to what is usually called the Classical spirit they are closely  confined to the triad being studied and are valid only in the domain specified This interdiscursive group is itself in its  group form related to other types of discourse with the analysis of representation the general theory of signs and  ideology on the one hand and with mathematics algebraic analysis and the attempt to establish a mathesis on the  other They are those internal and external relations that characterize Natural History the Analysis of Wealth and  General Grammar as a specific group and make it possible to recognize in them an interdiscursive configuration   There are those who would say Why did you not speak of cosmology physiology or Biblical exegesis Could not  preLavoisier chemistry or Eulers mathematics or Vicos history have invalidated all the analyses to be found in The  Order of Things Are there not in the inventive richness of the eighteenth century many other ideas that do not fit into        176   the rigid framework of archaeology To such people with their quite legitimate impatience to all the counterexamples  which as I am very well aware they could supply I will reply of course I not only admit that my analysis is limited I  want it so I have made it so What for me would he a counterexample would be precisely the possibility of saying all  these relations that you have described in three particular formations all these networks in which the theories of  attribution articulation designation and derivation are articulated upon one another all that taxonomy that rests on a  discontinuous characterization and a continuity of order are found uniformly and in the same way in geometry rational  mechanics the physiology of humours and germs Biblical criticism and emergent crystallography This would in fact  prove that I did not describe as I claimed to have done a region of interpositivity I would have characterized the spirit or  science of a period  the very thing to which my whole enterprise is opposed The relations that I have described are  valid in order to define a particular configuration they are not signs to describe the face of a culture in its totality It is the  friends of the Weltanschauung who will be disappointed I insist that the description that I have undertaken is quite  different from theirs What for them is a lacuna an omission an error is for me a deliberate methodical exclusion   But one might also say you have compared General Grammar with Natural History and the Analysis of Wealth But  why not with History as it was practised at the time with Biblical criticism with rhetoric with the theory of the fine  arts Wouldnt you then have discovered a quite different field of interpositivity What privilege then has the one that     you have described  Privilege none it is only one of the describable groups if in fact one took General Grammar  and tried to define its relations with the historical disciplines and textual criticism one would certainly see the emergence  of a quite different system of relations and a description would reveal an interdiscursive network that was not identical  with the first but which would overlap at certain points Similarly the taxonomy of the naturalists might be compared not  with grammar and economics but with physiology and pathology there too new interpositivities would emerge one  only has to compare the taxonomygrammareconomics relations analysed in The Order of Things with the  taxonomypathology relations studied in Naissance de In   177     clinique The number of such networks is not therefore defined in advance only the test of analysis can show whether  they exist and which of them exist that is which can be described Moreover every discursive formation does not  belong necessarily at least to only one of these systems but enters simultaneously into several fields of relations in  which it does not occupy the same place or exercise the same function the taxonomypathology relations are not  isomorphic with the taxonomygrammar relations the grammarAnalysis of Wealth relations are not isomorphic with the  grammarexegesis relations   The horizon of archaeology therefore is not a science a rationality a mentality a culture it is a tangle of  interpositivities whose limits and points of intersection cannot be fixed in a single operation Archaeology is a  comparative analysis that is not intended to reduce the diversity of discourses and to outline the unity that must totalize  them but is intended to divide up their diversity into different figures Archaeological comparison does not have a  unifying but a diversifying effect     2 In confronting General Grammar Natural History and the Analysis of Wealth in the seventeenth and eighteenth  centuries one might wonder what ideas were shared at that time by linguists naturalists and economists one might  wonder what implicit postulates they shared despite the diversity of their theories what general perhaps unstated  principles they obeyed one might wonder what influence the analysis of language exercised on taxonomy or what role  the idea of an ordered nature played in the theory of wealth one might also study the respective diffusion of these  different types of discourse the prestige accorded to each the value attributed to it on account of its age or on the  contrary on account of its newness or of its greater rigour the channels of communication by which information was  exchanged lastly one might as in quite traditional analyses wonder to what extent Rousseau had transferred to the  analysis of languages and their origin his knowledge and experience as a botanist what common categories Turgot  applied to the analysis of coinage and to the theory of language and etymology how the idea of a universal artificial and  perfect language had been taken up again and used by such classifiers as Linnaeus and Adanson Of course these  questions would be legitimate     178   some of them at least But none of them would be relevant to the level of archaeology  What archaeology wishes to uncover is primarily  in the specificity and distance maintained in various discursive   formations  the play of analogies and differences as they appear at the level of rules of formation This implies five  distinct tasks     aTo show how quite different discursive elements may be formed on the basis of similar rules the  concepts of General Grammar like those of verb subject complement root are formed on the basis of the  same arrangements of the enunciative field  theories of attribution articulation designation and derivation   as the very different radically heterogeneous concepts of Natural History and Economy to show between  different formations the archaeological isomorphisms   bTo show to what extent these rules do or do not apply in the same way are or are not linked in the same  order are or are not arranged in accordance with the same model in different types of discourse General  Grammar follows and in that same order the theory of attribution the theory of articulation the theory of  designation and the theory of derivation Natural History and the Analysis of Wealth regroup the first two and  the last two but they link each of them in the reverse order to define the archaeological model of each  formation   cTo show how entirely different concepts like those of value and specific character or price and generic  character occupy a similar position in the ramification of their system of positivity  that they are therefore  endowed with an archaeological isotopia  although their domain of application their degree of formalization  and above all their historical genesis make them quite alien to one another   dTo show on the other hand how a single notion possibly designated by a single word may cover two  archaeologically distinct elements the notions of origin and evolution have neither the same role the same  place nor the same formation in the system of positivity of General Grammar and Natural History to indicate  the archaeological shifts   179  e Lastly to show how from one positivity to another relations of subordination or complementarity may he   established thus in relation to the Analysis of Wealth and the analysis of species the description of language plays a  dominant role in the Classical period in so far as it is the theory of institutional signs that duplicate mark and     represent the representation itself to establish the archaeological correlations     None of these descriptions is based on the attribution of influences exchanges transmitted information or  communications Not that I wish to deny their existence or deny that they could ever be the object of a description But  rather that I have tried to step back from them to shift the level of attack of the analysis to reveal what made them  possible to map the points at which the projection of one concept upon another could take place to fix the isomorphism  that made a transference of methods or techniques possible to show the proximities sysmmetries or analogies that have  made generalizations possible in short to describe the field of vectors and of differential receptivity of permeability and  impermeability that has been a condition of historical possibility for the interplay of exchanges A configuration of  interpositivity is not a group of neighbouring disciplines it is not only an observable phenomenon of resemblance it is  not only the overall relation of several discourses to this or that other discourse it is the law of their communications  Because Rousseau and others reflected in turn on the ordering of the species and the origin of the languages this does not  mean that relations were made and exchanges occurred between taxonomy and grammar or because Turgot after Law  and Petty wished to treat coinage as a sign that economy and the theory of language were brought close together and that  their history still bears the trace of these attempts It means rather  if at least one is attempting to make an  archaeological description  that the respective arrangements of these three positivities were such that at the level of  uuvres authors individual existences projects and attempts one can find such exchanges     3 Archaeology also reveals relations between discursive formations and nondiscursive domains institutions political  events economic   180  practices and processes These rapprochements are not intended to uncover great cultural continuities nor to isolate  mechanisms of causality Before a set of enunciative facts archaeology does not ask what could have motivated them the  search for contexts of formulation nor does it seek to rediscover what is expressed in them the task of hermeneutics it  tries to determine how the rules of formation that govern it  and which characterize the positivity to which it belongs   may be linked to nondiscursive systems it seeks to define specific forms of articulation   Let us take the example of clinical medicine whose establishment at the end of the eighteenth century is contemporary  with a number of political events economic phenomena and institutional changes Between these facts and the  organization of hospital medicine it is easy enough to suspect the existence of certain links at least if one operates  largely on intuition But how can such links be analysed A symbolic analysis would see in the organizing of clinical  medicine and in the historical processes that were concomitant with it two simultaneous expressions which reflect and  symbolize one another which serve each other as a mirror and whose meanings are caught up in an endless play of  reflexion two expressions that express nothing but the form that they share Thus medical ideas of organic solidarity  functional cohesion tissular communication  and the abandonment of the classificatory principle of diseases in favour  of an analysis of the bodily interactions  might correspond in order to reflect them but also to he reflected in them to  a political practice that is discovering beneath still feudal stratifications relations of a functional type economic con nexions a society whose dependences and reciprocities were to provide in the form of society the analogon of life A  causal analysis on the other hand would try to discover to what extent political changes or ecomonic processes could  determine the consciousness of scientists  the horizon and direction of their interest their system of values their way of  perceiving things the style of their rationality thus at a period in which industrial capitalism was beginning to  recalculate its manpower requirements disease took a on social dimension the maintenance of health cure public  assistance for the poor and sick the search for pathological causes and sites became a collective responsibility that must  be assumed by the state Hence the value placed upon   181  the body as a work tool the care to rationalize medicine on the basis of the other sciences the efforts to maintain the  level of health of a population the attention paid to therapy aftercare and the recording of longterm phenomena   Archaeology situates its analysis at another level the phenomena of expression reflexions and symbolization are for  it merely the effects of an overall reading in search of formal analogies or translations of meaning as for causal  relations they may be assigned to the level of the context or of the situation and their effect on the speaking subject  both in any case can be mapped once one has defined the positivities in which they appear and the rules in accordance  with which these positivities have been formed The field of relations that characterizes a discursive formation is the  locus in which symbolizations and effects may he perceived situated and determined If archaeology brings medical  discourse closer to a number of practices it is in order to discover far less immediate relations than expression but far  more direct relations than those of a causality communicated through the consciousness of the speaking subjects It  wishes to show not how political practice has determined the meaning and form of medical discourse but how and in  what form it takes part in its conditions of emergence insertion and functioning This relation may he assigned to  several levels First to that of the division and delimitation of the medical object not of course that it was political  practice that from the early nineteenth century imposed on medicine such new objects as tissular lesions or the anatomo physiological correlations but it opened up new fields for the mapping of medical objects these fields are constituted by  the mass of the population administratively compartmented and supervised gauged according to certain norms of life  and health and analysed according to documentary and statistical forms of registration they are also constituted by the     great conscript armies of the revolutionary and Napoleonic period with their specific form of medical control they are  also constituted by the institutions of hospital assistance that were defined at the end of the eighteenth and the beginning  of the nineteenth centuries in relation to the economic needs of the time and to the reciprocal position of the social  classes One can also see the appearance of this relation of political practice to medical discourse in the status accorded  to the doctor who becomes   182  not only the privileged but also virtually the exclusive enunciator of this discourse in the form of institutional relation  that the doctor may have with the hospitalized patient or with his private practice in the modalities of teaching and  diffusion that are prescribed or authorized for this knowledge Lastly one can grasp this relation in the function that is  attributed to medical discourse or in the role that is required of it when it is a question of judging individuals making  administrative decisions laying down the norms of a society translating  in order to resolve or to conceal them   conflicts of another order giving models of a natural type to analyses of society and to the practices that concern it It is  not a question then of showing how the political practice of a given society constituted or modified the medical concepts  and theoretical structure of pathology but how medical discourse as a practice concerned with a particular field of  objects finding itself in the hands of a certain number of statutorily designated individuals and having certain functions  to exercise in society is articulated on practices that are external to it and which are not themselves of a discursive order     If in this analysis archaeology suspends the theme of expression and reflexion if it refuses to see in discourse the  surface of the symbolic projection of events or processes that are situated elsewhere it is not in order to rediscover a  causal sequence that might be described point by point and which would make it possible to relate a discovery and an  event or a concept and a social structure But on the other hand if it suspends such a causal analysis if it wishes to avoid  the necessary connexion through the speaking subject it is not in order to guarantee the sovereign sole independence of  discourse it is in order to discover the domain of existence and functioning of a discursive practice In other words the  archaeological description of discourses is deployed in the dimension of a general history it seeks to discover that whole  domain of institutions economic processes and social relations on which a discursive formation can be articulated it  tries to show how the autonomy of discourse and its specificity nevertheless do not give it the status of pure ideality and  total historical independence what it wishes to uncover is the particular level in which history can give place to definite  types of discourse which have their own type of historicity and which are related to a whole set of various historicities   5 CHANGE And TRANSFORMATIONS   Let us now turn to the archaeological description of change Whatever theoretical criticisms one can make of the  traditional history of ideas it does at least take as its essential theme the phenomena of temporal succession and  sequence analyses them in accordance with schemata of evolution and thus describes the historical deployment of dis courses Archaeology however seems to treat history only to freeze it On the one hand by describing discursive  formations it ignores the temporal relations that may he manifested in them it seeks general rules that will he uniformly  valid in the same way and at every point in time does it not therefore impose the constricting figure of a synchrony on  a development that may he slow and imperceptible In this world of ideas which is in itself so untrustworthy in which  apparently the most stable figures disappear so quickly but in which so many irregularities occur that are later accorded  definitive status in which the future always anticipates itself whereas the past is constantly shifting is not archaeology  valid as a sort of motionless thought And on the other hand when it does have recourse to chronology it is only it  seems in order to fix at the limits of the positivities two pinpoints the moment at which they are born and the moment  at which they        184   disappear as if duration was used only to fix this crude calendar and was omitted throughout the analysis itself as if time  existed only in the vacant moment of rupture in that white paradoxically atemporal crack in which one sudden  formulation replaces another Whether as a synchrony of positivities or as an instantaneity of substitutions time is     avoided and with it the possibility of a historical description disappears Discourse is snatched from the law of  development and established in a discontinuous atemporality It is immobilized in fragments precarious splinters of  eternity But there is nothing one can do about it several eternities succeeding one another a play of fixed images  disappearing in turn do not constitute either movement time or history   But the problem must be examined in greater detail   Let us take first the apparent synchrony of discursive formations One thing is true it is no use establishing the rules in  every statement and they cannot therefore he put into operation with every statement they do not change each time they  can he found at work in statements or groups of statements in widely separated periods We have seen for example that  for nearly a century  from Tournefort to Jussieu  the various objects of Natural History obeyed the same rules of  formation we have seen that the theory of attribution is the same and plays the same role in the work of Lancelot  Condillac and Destutt de Tracy Moreover we have seen that the order of statements based on archaeological derivation  did not necessarily reproduce the order of successions one can find in Beauzee statements that are archeologically  anterior to those to be found in the Grammaire of PortRoyal In such an analysis therefore there is a suspension of  temporal successions  or to be more precise of the calendar of formulations But this suspension is intended precisely  to reveal the relations that characterize the temporality of discursive formations and articulate them in series whose  intersection in no way precludes analysis     a Archaeology defines the rules of formation of a group of state  ments In this way it shows how a succession of events may in the same        185  order in which it is presented become an object of discourse be recorded described explained elaborated into concepts  and provide the opportunity for a theoretical choice Archaeology analyses the degree and form of permeability of a  discourse it provides the principle of its articulation over a chain of successive events it defines the operators by which  the events are transcribed into statements It does not challenge for example the relation between the Analysis of Wealth  and the great monetary fluctuations of the seventeenth and early eighteenth centuries it tries to show what in these  crises could be given as an object of discourse how those crises could be conceptualized in such an object how the  interests that were in conflict throughout these processes could deploy their strategy in them Or again it does not claim  that the cholera epidemic of 1832 was not an event that concerned medicine it shows how clinical discourse put into  operation such a body of rules that a whole domain of medical objects could then be reorganized that a whole group of  methods of recording and notation could be used that the concept of inflammation could be abandoned and the old  theoretical problem of fevers could be resolved definitively Archaeology does not deny the possibility of new statements  in correlation with external events Its task is to show on what condition a correlation can exist between them and what  precisely it consists of what are its limits its form its code its law of possibility It does not try to avoid that mobility of  discourses that makes them move to the rhythm of events it tries to free the level at which it is set in motion  what  might he called the level of evential engagement An engagement that is specific for every discursive formation and  which does not have the same rules the same operators or the same sensibility in for example the Analysis of Wealth  and in Political Economy in the old medicine of the constitutions and in modern epidemiology     h Moreover all the rules of formation assigned by archaeology to a positivity do not have the same generality some  are more specific and derive from others This subordination may be merely hierarchical but it may also involve a  temporal vector Thus in General Grammar the theory of the verbattribution and that of the nounarticulation are linked  to one another and the second derives from the first but        186  without it being possible to determine an order of succession between them other than the  deductive or rhetorical order that has been chosen for the expose On the other hand the analysis  of the complement or the search for roots could appear or reappear only when the analysis of  the attributive sentence or the notion of the noun as an analytic sign of representation had been  developed Another example in the Classical period the principle of the continuity of beings is  implied in the classification of species according to structural characters and in this sense they  are simultaneous on the other hand it is only when this classification is undertaken that the  lacunae and gaps may be interpreted in the categories of a history of nature of the earth and of  the species In other words the archaeological ramification of the rules of formation is not a  uniformly simultaneous network there exist relations branches derivations that are temporally  neutral there exist others that imply a particular temporal direction Archaeology then takes as     its model neither a purely logical schema of simultaneities nor a linear succession of events but  it tries to show the intersection between necessarily successive relations and others that are not so  It does not believe therefore that a system of positivity is a synchronic figure that one can  perceive only by suspending the whole of the diachronic process Far from being indifferent to  succession archaeology maps the temporal vectors of derivation     Archaeology does not set out to treat as simultaneous what is given as successive it does not   try to freeze time and to substitute for its flux of events correlations that outline a motionless  figure What it suspends is the theme that succession is an absolute a primary indissociable  sequence to which discourse is subjected by the law of its finitude it is also the theme that there  is in discourse only one form and only one level of succession For these themes it substitutes  analyses that reveal both the various forms of succession that are superposed in discourse and by  forms I do not simply mean the rhythms or causes but the series themselves and the way in  which the successions thus specified are articulated Instead of following the thread of an original  calendar in relation to which one would establish the chronology of successive or simultaneous  events that of short or lasting processes that of momentary or permanent phenomena one tries to  show how it is   187  possible for there to be succession and at what different levels distinct successions are to be found To constitute an  archaeological history of discourse then one must free oneself of two models that have for so long imposed their image  the linear model of speech and partly at least of writing in which all events succeed one another without any effect of  coincidence and superposition and the model of the stream of consciousness whose presence always eludes itself in its  openness to the future and its retention of the past Paradoxical as it may be discursive formations do not have the same  model of historicity as the flow of consciousness or the linearity of language Discourse at least as analysed by  archaeology that is at the level of its positivity is not a consciousness that embodies its project in the external form of  language langage it is not a language longue plus a subject to speak it It is a practice that has its own forms of  sequence and succession   Archaeology is much more willing than the history of ideas to speak of discontinuities ruptures gaps entirely new forms  of positivity and of sudden redistributions The practice of political economy was traditionally to seek everything that  led up to Ricardo everything that could foreshadow his analyses methods and principal notions everything that tended  to make his discoveries more probable the practice of the history of comparative grammar was to rediscover  beyond  Bopp and Rask  earlier research into the filiation and kinship of languages it was to determine how much Anquetil Duperron contributed towards the constitution of an IndoEuropean domain it was to uncover the first comparison made  in 1769 of Sanskrit and Latin conjugations it may even lead one back to Harris or Ramus Archaeology proceeds in the  opposite direction it seeks rather to untie all those knots that historians have patiently tied it increases differences blurs  the lines of communication and tries to make it more difficult to pass from one thing to another it does not try to show  that the Physiocratic analysis of production foreshadowed that of Ricardo it does not regard it as relevant to its own  analyses to say that Cceurdoux foreshadowed Bopp   What does this insistence on discontinuities correspond to In fact it       188   is paradoxical only in relation to the practice of the historians of ideas It is rather the history of ideas  with its concern  for continuities transitions anticipations and foreshadowings  that plays with paradox From Daubenton to Cuvier  from Anquetil to Bopp from Graslin Turgot or Forbonnais to Ricardo  even such a chronologically small gap  the  differences are innumerable some are localized others are more general some concern methods others concepts  sometimes they concern the domain of objects at others the whole linguistic instrument More striking still is the  example of medicine in a quarter of a century from 1790 to 1815 medical discourse changed more profoundly than  since the seventeenth century probably than since the Middle Ages and perhaps even since Greek medicine a change  that revealed new objects organic lesions deep sites tissular alterations ways and forms of interorganic diffusion  anatomoclinical signs and correlations techniques of observation of detection of the pathological site recording a new  perceptual grid and on almost entirely new descriptive vocabulary new sets of concepts and nosographical distributions  centuryold sometimes ageold categories such as fever or constitution disappeared and diseases that are perhaps as     old as the world  like tuberculosis  were at last isolated and named Those who say that archaeology invents  differences in an arbitrary way can never have opened La Nosographic philosophique and the Traite des membranes  Archaeology is simply trying to take such differences seriously to throw some light on the matter to determine how  they are divided up how they are entangled with one another how they govern or are governed by one another to which  distinct categories they belong in short to describe these differences not to establish a system of differences between  them If there is a paradox in archaeology it is not that it increases differences but that it refuses to reduce them  thus  inverting the usual values For the history of ideas the appearance of difference indicates an error or a trap instead of  examining it the clever historian must try to reduce it to find beneath it a smaller difference and beneath that an even  smaller one and so on until he reaches the ideal limit the nondifference of perfect continuity Archaeology on the  other hand takes as the object of its description what is usually regarded as an obstacle its aim is not to overcome  differences but to analyse them to say what        189  exactly they consist of to differentiate them How does this differentiation operate     1 Instead of considering that discourse is made up of a series of homogeneous events individual formulations  archaeology distinguishes several possible levels of events within the very density of discourse the level of the  statements themselves in their unique emergence the level of the appearance of objects types of enunciation concepts  strategic choices or transformations that affect those that already exist the level of the derivation of new rules of  formation on the basis of rules that are already in operation  but always in the element of a single positivity lastly a  fourth level at which the substitution of one discursive formation for another takes place or the mere appearance and  disappearance of a positivity These events which are by far the most rare are for archaeology the most important  only archaeology in any case can reveal them But they are not the exclusive object of its description it would be a  mistake to think that they have an absolute control over all the others and that they lead to similar simultaneous  ruptures at the different levels distinguished above All the events that occur within the density of discourse are not  immediately below one another Of course the appearance of a discursive formation is often correlative with a vast  renewal of objects forms of enunciation concepts and strategies a principle that is not universal however General  Grammar was established in the seventeenth century without much apparent alteration in grammatical tradition but it is  not possible to determine the particular concept or object that suddenly manifests its presence One should not describe  such an event therefore in accordance with categories that may be suitable for the emergence of a formulation or the  appearance of a new word It is useless to ask of such an event questions like Who is its author Who is speaking In  what circumstances and in what context With what intentions what project in mind The appearance of a new  positivity is not indicated by a new sentence  unexpected surprising logically unpredictable stylistically deviant  that  is inserted into a text and announces either the opening of a new chapter or the entry of a new speaker It is an event of  a quite different type   i          190  2 In order to analyse such events it is not enough simply to indicate changes and to relate them immediately to the   theological aesthetic model of creation with its transcendence with all its originalities and inventions or to the  psychological model of the act of consciousness with its previous obscurity its anticipations its favourable  circumstances its powers of restoration or to the biological model of evolution We must define precisely what these  changes consist of that is substitute for an undifferentiated reference to change  which is both a general container for  all events and the abstract principle of their succession  the analysis of transformations The disappearance of one  positivity and the emergence of another implies several types of transformation By going from the more particular to the  more general one can and must describe how the different elements of a system of formation were transformed what  for example were the variations in the rate of unemployment and labour needs what were the political decisions  concerning the guilds and the universities what were the new needs and new possibilities of public assistance at the end  of the eighteenth century  all these were elements in the system of formation of clinical medicine how the  characteristic relations of a system of formation were transformed how in the middle of the seventeenth century for  example the relation between the perceptual field the linguistic code the use of instruments and information that was  put into operation by the discourse on living beings was modified thus making possible the definition of the objects  proper to Natural History how the relations between different rules of formation were transformed how for example  biology modified the order and the dependence that Natural History had established between the theory of  characterization and the analysis of temporal derivations lastly how the relations between various positivities were  transformed how the relations between philology biology and economics transform the relations between General  Grammar Natural History and the Analysis of Wealth how the interdiscursive configuration outlined by the privileged  relations of these three disciplines is decomposed how their respective relations with mathematics and philosophy are  modified how a place emerges for other discursive formations and in particular for that interpositivity that was later to  assume the name of the human sciences Rather than refer to the living force of change as if it were           191   its own principle rather than seek its causes as if it were no more than a mere effect archaeology tries to establish the  system of transformations that constitute change it tries to develop this empty abstract notion with a view to  according it the analysable status of transformation It is understandable that some minds are so attached to all those old  metaphors by which for a century and a half history movement flux evolution has been imagined that they see  archaeology simply as the negation of history and the crude affirmation of discontinuity the truth is that they cannot  accept that change should be cleansed of all these adventitious models that it should be deprived of both its primacy as a  universal law and its status as a general effect and that it should be replaced by the analysis of various transformations     3 To say that one discursive formation is substituted for another is not to say that a whole world of absolutely new  objects enunciations concepts and theoretical choices emerges fully armed and fully organized in a text that will place  that world once and for all it is to say that a general transformation of relations has occurred but that it does not  necessarily alter all the elements it is to say that statements are governed by new rules of formation it is not to say that  all objects or concepts all enunciations or all theoretical choices disappear On the contrary one can on the basis of  these new rules describe and analyse phenomena of continuity return and repetition we must not forget that a rule of  formation is neither the determination of an object nor the characterization of a type of enunciation nor the form or  content of a concept but the principle of their multiplicity and dispersion One of these elements  or several of them   may remain identical preserve the same division the same characteristics the same structures yet belong to  different systems of dispersion and be governed by distinct laws of formation One can find in such phenomena  therefore elements that remain throughout several distinct positivities their form and content remaining the same but  their formations being heterogeneous such as monetary circulation as an object first in the Analysis of Wealth and then  in political economy the concept of character first in Natural History then in biology elements that are constituted  modified organized in one discursive formation and which stabilized at last figure in another such as the concept of  reflex which as        192   G Canguilhem has shown was formed in Classical science from Willis to Prochaska then entered modern physiology  elements that appear later as an ultimate derivation in a discursive formation and which occupy an important place in a     later formation such as the notion of organism which appeared at the end of the eighteenth century in Natural History  and as the result of a whole taxonomic enterprise of characterization and which became the major concept of biology at  the time of Cuvier or the notion of lesional site which Morgagni discovered and which became one of the principal  concepts of clinical medicine elements that reappear after a period of desuetude oblivion or even invalidation such as  the return to a Linnaean type of fixism in a biologist like Cuvier or the reactivation in the eighteenth century of the old  notion of an original language The problem for archaeology is not to deny such phenomena nor to try to diminish their  importance but on the contrary to try to describe and measure them how can such permanences or repetitions such  long sequences or such curves projected through time exist Archaeology does not hold the content for the primary and  ultimate dormee that must account for all the rest on the contrary it considers that the same the repetitive and the  uninterrupted are no less problematic than the ruptures for archaeology the identical and the continuous are not what  must be found at the end of the analysis they figure in the element of a discursive practice they too are governed by the  rules of formation of positivities far from manifesting that fundamental reassuring inertia which we like to use as a  criterion of change they are themselves actively regularly formed And to those who might be tempted to criticize  archaeology for concerning itself primarily with the analysis of the discontinuous to all those agoraphobics of history and  time to all those who confuse rupture and irrationality I will reply It is you who devalue the continuous by the use that  you make of it You treat it as the supportelement to which everything else must be related you treat it as the primary  law the essential weight of any discursive practice you would like to analyse every modification in the field of this  inertia as one analyses every movement in the gravitational field But in according this status to continuity you are  merely neutralizing it driving it out to the outer limit of time towards an original passivity Archaeology proposes to  invert this arrangement or rather for our              193   aim is not to accord to the discontinuous the role formerly accorded to the continuous to play one off against the other  to show how the continuous is formed in accordance with the same conditions and the same rules as dispersion and how  it enters  neither more nor less than differences inventions innovations or deviations  the field of discursive  practice     4 The appearance and disappearance of positivities the play of substitutions to which they give rise do not constitute     a homogeneous process that takes place everywhere in the same way We must not imagine that rupture is a sort of great  drift that carries with it all discursive formations at once rupture is not an undifferentiated interval  even a  momentary one  between two manifest phases it is not a kind of lapsus without duration that separates two periods  and which deploys two heterogeneous stages on either side of a split it is always a discontinuity specified by a number  of distinct transformations between two particular positivities The analysis of archaeological breaks sets out therefore  to establish between so many different changes analogies and differences hierarchies complementarities coincidences  and shifts in short to describe the dispersion of the discontinuities themselves   The idea of a single break suddenly at a given moment dividing all discursive formations interrupting them in a  single moment and reconstituting them in accordance with the same rules  such an idea cannot be sustained The  contemporaneity of several transformations does not mean their exact chronological coincidence each transformation  may have its own particular index of temporal viscosity Natural History General Grammar and the Analysis of  Wealth were constituted in similar ways and all three in the course of the seventeenth century but the system of  formation of the Analysis of Wealth was linked with a great many conditions and nondiscursive practices the  circulation of goods monetary manipulations and their effects the system of protecting trade and manufactures  fluctuations in the quantity of metal coined hence the slowness of a process that lasted for over a century from  Grammont to Cantillon whereas the transformations that had taken place in General Grammar and Natural History had  extended over scarcely more than twentyfive years Inversely contemporary   194  similar and linked transformations do not belong to a single model that is reproduced several times on the surface of  discourses and imposes on all a strictly identical form of rupture when one describes the archaeological break that led to  philology biology and economics one is showing how these three positivities were linked by the disappearance of the  analysis of the sign and of the theory of representation what symmetrical effects it could produce the idea of a totality  and of an organic adaptation among living beings the idea of morphological coherence and of a regulated evolution in  languages the idea of a form of production that has its internal laws and its limits of development but it also shows what  were the specific differences of these transformations how in particular historicity is introduced in a particular way in  these three positivities how their relation to history cannot therefore be the same even though they all have a particular  relation with it   Lastly there are important shifts between different archaeological ruptures  and sometimes even between discursive  formations that are very close and linked by a great many relations Let us take the disciplines of languages and historical  analysis the great transformation that gave rise at the beginning of the nineteenth century to a historical comparative  grammar preceded by a good halfcentury the mutation in historical discourse as a result the system of interpositivity in  which philology was involved was profoundly affected in the second half of the nineteenth century without the positivity  of philology ever being put into question Hence phenomena of fragmented shift of which we can cite at least another  famous example concepts like those of surplus value or falling rate of profit as found in Marx may be described on the  basis of the system of positivity that is already in operation in the work of Ricardo but these concepts which are new  but whose rules of formation are not appear  in Marx himself  as belonging at the same time to a quite different  discursive practice they are formed in that discursive practice in accordance with specific laws they occupy in it a  different position they do not figure in the same sequences this new positivity is not a transformation of Ricardos  analyses it is not a new political economy it is a discourse that occurred around the derivation of certain economic  concepts but which in turn defines the conditions in which the discourse of   195  economists takes place and may therefore be valid as a theory and a critique of political economy   Archaeology disarticulates the synchrony of breaks just as it destroyed the abstract unity of  change and event The period is neither its basic unity nor its horizon nor its object if it speaks of  these things it is always in terms of particular discursive practices and as a result of its analyses  The Classical age which has often been mentioned in archaeological analyses is not a temporal  figure that imposes its unity and empty form on all discourses it is the name that is given to a  tangle of continuities and discontinuities modifications within positivities discursive formations  that appear and disappear Similarly rupture is not for archaeology the prop of its analyses the  limit that it indicates from afar without being able either to determine it or to give it specificity  rupture is the name given to transformations that bear on the general rules of one or several  discursive formations Thus the French Revolution  since up to now all archaeological analyses  have been centred on it  does not play the role of an event exterior to discourse whose divisive  effect one is under some kind of obligation to discover in all discourses it functions as a complex  articulated describable group of transformations that left a number of positivities intact fixed for a     number of others rules that are still with us and also established positivities that have recently  disappeared or are still disappearing before our eyes     196   6 SCIENCE AND KNOWLEDGE  A silent delimitation has been imposed on all the preceding analyses without the principle  governing it or even its outline being made clear All the examples referred to belonged without  exception to a very small domain In no way could I be said to have covered let alone analysed  the immense domain of discourse why did I systematically ignore literary philosophical or  political texts Do not discursive formations and systems of positivities have a place in them too  And if I was restricting my attention to the sciences why did I say nothing of mathematics  physics or chemistry Why did I concentrate on so many dubious still imprecise disciplines that  are perhaps doomed for ever to remain below the threshold of scientificity In short what is the  relation between archaeology and the analysis of the sciences   a POSITIVITIES DISCIPLINES SCIENCES  First question does not archaeology under the rather bizarre terms of discursive formation and  positivity describe what are quite simply pseudosciences like psychopathology sciences at the  prehistoric stage like Natural History or sciences entirely penetrated with ideology like political  economy Is it not the privileged analysis of what will always remain quasiscientific If one calls  disciplines groups of         197  statements that borrow their organization from scientific models which tend to coherence and demonstrativity which are  accepted institutionalized transmitted and sometimes taught as sciences could one not say that archaeology describes  disciplines that are not really sciences while epistemology describes sciences that have been formed on the basis of or in  spite of existing disciplines   To these questions I can reply in the negative Archaeology does not describe disciplines At most such disciplines  may in their manifest deployment serve as startingpoints for the description of positivities but they do not fix its limits  they do not impose definitive divisions upon it at the end of the analysis they do not reemerge in the same state in which  they entered it one cannot establish a biunivocal relation between established disciplines and discursive formations   Let us take an example of this distortion The linchpin of Madness and Civilization was the appearance at the  beginning of the nineteenth century of a psychiatric discipline This discipline had neither the same content nor the same  internal organization nor the same place in medicine nor the same practical function nor the same methods as the  traditional chapter on diseases of the head or nervous diseases to be found in eighteenthcentury medical treatises But  on examining this new discipline we discovered two things what made it possible at the time it appeared what brought     about this great change in the economy of concepts analyses and demonstrations was a whole set of relations between  hospitalization internment the conditions and procedures of social exclusion the rules of jurisprudence the norms of  industrial labour and bourgeois morality in short a whole group of relations that characterized for this discursive practice  the formation of its statements but this practice is not only manifested in a discipline possessing a scientific status and  scientific pretensions it is also found in operation in legal texts in literature in philosophy in political decisions and in  the statements made and the opinions expressed in daily life The discursive formation whose existence was mapped by  the psychiatric discipline was not coextensive with it far from it it went well beyond the boundaries of psychiatry  Moreover by going back in time and trying to discover what in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries could have  preceded the establishment of psychiatry we realized that there was no such prior discipline what had been said        198   on the subject of mania delirium melancholia and nervous diseases by the doctors of the Classical period in no way  constituted an autonomous discipline but at most a commentary on the analysis of fevers of alterations in the humours  or of affections of the brain However despite the absence of any established discipline a discursive practice with its  own regularity and consistency was in operation This discursive practice was certainly present in medicine but it was  also to be found in administrative regulations in literary or philosophical texts in casuistics in the theories or projects  of obligatory labour or assistance to the poor In the Classical period therefore there were a discursive formation and a  positivity perfectly accessible to description to which corresponded no definite discipline that could be compared with  psychiatry   But although it is true that positivities are not merely the doublets of established disciplines are they not the  prototypes of future sciences By discursive formation does one not mean the retrospective projection of sciences on  their own past the shadow that they cast on what preceded them and which thus appears to have foreshadowed them  What we have described for example as the Analysis of Wealth or General Grammar thus according them what was  perhaps a highly artificial autonomy was it not quite simply political economy in an inchoate state or a stage prior to  the establishment of a truly rigorous science of language Is it archaeology trying by means of a retrograde movement  whose legitimacy it would no doubt be difficult to establish to regroup in an independent discursive practice all the  heterogeneous and dispersed elements whose complicity will prove to he necessary to the establishment of a science   Again the answer must be in the negative What was analysed under the name of Natural History does not embrace  in a single figure everything that in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries might validly constitute a prototype of the  science of life and figure in its legitimate genealogy The positivity thus revealed accounts for a number of statements  concerning the resemblances and differences between beings their visible structure their specific and generic char acters their possible classification the discontinuities that separate them and the transitions that connect them but it  ignores a number of other analyses that date nevertheless from the same period and which        199  also outline the ancestral figures of biology the analysis of reflex movement which was to have so much importance in  the constitution of an anatomophysiology of the nervous system the theory of germs which seems to anticipate the  problems of evolution and genetics the explanation of animal or vegetal growth which was to be one of the major  questions of the physiology of organisms in general Moreover far from anticipating a future biology Natural History   a taxonomic discourse linked to the theory of signs and to the project of a science of order  excluded by its solidity  and autonomy the constitution of a unitary science of life Similarly the discursive formation described as General  Grammar does not take into account  far from it  everything that could have been said about language in the  Classical period and of which the inheritance or repudiation development or critique was to be found later in philology  it ignored the methods of Biblical exegesis and that philosophy of language as formulated by Vico or Herder Discursive  formations are not therefore future sciences at the stage at which still unconscious of themselves they are quietly being  constituted they are not in fact in a state of teleological subordination in relation to the orthogenesis of the sciences   Should it be said therefore that there can he no science where there is a positivity and that positivities are always  exclusive of the sciences Should it be supposed that instead of being in a chronological relation to the sciences they are  in fact alternatives That they are in a way the positive figure of a certain epistemological defect But here too one  could find a counterexample Clinical medicine is certainly not a science Not only because it does not comply with the  formal criteria or attain the level of rigour expected of physics chemistry or even of physiology but also because it  involves a scarcely organized mass of empirical observations uncontrolled experiments and results therapeutic  prescriptions and institutional regulations And yet this nonscience is not exclusive of science in the course of the  nineteenth century it established definite relations between such perfectly constituted sciences as physiology chemistry  or microbiology moreover it gave rise to such discourses as that of morbid anatomy which it would be presumptuous no  doubt to call a false science     Discursive formations can be identified therefore neither as sciences nor as scarcely scientific disciplines nor as  distant prefigurations        200  of the sciences to come nor as forms that exclude any scientificity from the outset What therefore is the relation  between the positivities and the sciences   b KNOWLEDGE SAVOIR  Positivities do not characterize forms of knowledge  whether they are a priori necessary conditions or forms of  rationality that have in turn been put into operation by history But neither do they define the state of knowledge at a  given moment in time they do not draw up a list of what from that moment had been demonstrated to be true and had  assumed the status of definitively acquired knowledge and a list of what on the other hand had been accepted without  either proof or adequate demonstration or of what had been accepted as a common belief or a belief demanded by the  power of the imagination To analyse positivities is to show in accordance with which rules a discursive practice may  form groups of objects enunciations concepts or theoretical choices The elements thus formed do not constitute a  science with a defined structure of ideality their system of relations is certainly less strict but neither are they items of  knowledge piled up one on top of another derived from heterogeneous experiments traditions or discoveries and linked  only by the identity of the subject that possesses them They are that on the basis of which coherent or incoherent  propositions are built up more or less exact descriptions developed verifications carried out theories deployed They  form the precondition of what is later revealed and which later functions as an item of knowledge or an illusion an  accepted truth or an exposed error a definitive acquisition or an obstacle surmounted This precondition may not of  course be analysed as a donee a lived experience still implicated in the imagination or in perception which manking in  the course of its history took up again in the form of rationality or which each individual must undergo on his own  account if he wishes to rediscover the ideal meanings that are contained or concealed within it It is not a preknowledge  or an archaic stage in the movement that leads from immediate knowledge to apodicticity it is a group of elements that  would have to be formed by a discursive practice if a scientific discourse was to be constituted specified not only by its  form and   201  rigour but also by the objects with which it deals the types of enunciation that it uses the concepts that it manipulates  and the strategies that it employs Thus science is not linked with that which must have been lived or must be lived if the  intention of ideality proper to it is to he established but with that which must have been said  or must be said  if a  discourse is to exist that complies if necessary with the experimental or formal criteria of scientificity   This group of elements formed in a regular manner by a discursive practice and which are indispensable to the  constitution of a science although they are not necessarily destined to give rise to one can he called knowledge  Knowledge is that of which one can speak in a discursive practice and which is specified by that fact the domain consti tuted by the different objects that will or will not acquire a scientific status the knowledge of psychiatry in the nineteenth  century is not the sum of what was thought to he true but the whole set of practices singularities and deviations of  which one could speak in psychiatric discourse knowledge is also the space in which the subject may take up a position  and speak of the objects with which he deals in his discourse in this sense the knowledge of clinical medicine is the  whole group of functions of observation interrogation decipherment recording and decision that may be exercised by  the subject of medical discourse knowledge is also the field of coordination and subordination of statements in which  concepts appear and are defined applied and transformed at this level the knowledge of Natural History in the  eighteenth century is not the sum of what was said but the whole set of modes and sites in accordance with which one  can integrate each new statement with the already said lastly knowledge is defined by the possibilities of use and  appropriation offered by discourse thus the knowledge of political economy in the Classical period is not the thesis of  the different theses sustained but the totality of its points of articulation on other discourses or on other practices that are  not discursive There are bodies of knowledge that are independent of the sciences which are neither their historical  prototypes nor their practical byproducts but there is no knowledge without a particular discursive practice and any  discursive practice may he defined by the knowledge that it forms   Instead of exploring the consciousnessknowledge connaissance   202   science axis which cannot escape subjectivity archaeology explores the discursive practiceknowledge savoirscience  axis And whereas the history of ideas finds the point of balance of its analysis in the element of connaissance and is  thus forced against its will to encounter the transcendental interrogation archaeology finds the point of balance of its  analysis in savoir  that is in a domain in which the subject is necessarily situated and dependent and can never figure as  titular either as a transcendental activity or as empirical consciousness   It is understandable in these conditions that we should distinguish carefully between scientific domains and  archaeological territories their articulation and their principles of organization are quite different Only propositions that     obey certain laws of construction belong to a domain of scientificity affirmations that have the same meaning that say  the same thing that are as true as they are but which do not belong to the same systematicity are excluded from this  domain what Diderots Le Reve de dAlembert says about the development of species may well express certain of the  concepts or certain of the scientific hypotheses of the period it may even anticipate a future truth it does not belong to  the domain of scientificity of Natural History but it does not belong to its archaeological territory if at least one can  discover in operation in it the same rules of formation as in Linnaeus Buffon Daubenton or Jussieu Archaeological  territories may extend to literary or philosophical texts as well as scientific ones Knowledge is to be found not only in  demonstrations it can also he found in fiction reflexion narrative accounts institutional regulations and political  decisions The archaeological territory of Natural History includes Bonnets Palingenesie philosophique or Benoit de  Maillets Telliamed although they do not comply to a great extent with the accepted scientific norms of the period and  even less of course with those that came to be required later The archaeological territory of General Grammar embraces  the imaginings of Fabre dOlivet which were never accorded scientific status and belong rather to the sphere of mystical  thought no less than the analysis of attributive propositions which was then accepted as evident truth and in which  generative grammar may now recognize its prefigured truth     footnote         For the distinction between connaissance and savoir cf note 3 p 16   203  Discursive practice does not coincide with the scientific development that it may give rise to and the knowledge that   it forms is neither an unfinished prototype nor the byproduct to be found in daily life of a constituted science The  sciences  ignoring for the moment the difference between discourses that have the status of scientificity or  pretensions to it and those that really present the formal criteria of a science  appear in the element of a discursive  formation and against the background of knowledge This opens up two series of problems what can be the place or role  of a region of scientificity in the archaeological territory in which it appears In accordance with what order and what  processes is the emergence of a region of scientificity in a given discursive formation accompished We cannot at  present provide solutions to these problems all we can do now is to indicate in what direction they might be analysed   c KNOWLEDGE SAVOIR AND IDEOLOGY  Once constituted a science does not take up with all the interconnexions that are proper to it everything that formed the  discursive practice in which it appeared nor does it dissipate  in order to condemn it to the prehistory of error  prejudice or imagination  the knowledge that surrounds it Morbid anatomy did not reduce to the norms of scientificity  the positivity of clinical medicine Knowledge is not an epistemological site that disappears in the science that supersedes  it Science or what is offered as such is localized in a field of knowledge and plays a role in it A role that varies  according to different discursive formations and is modified with their mutations What in the Classical period was  offered as the medical knowledge of diseases of the mind occupied a very small place in the knowledge of madness it  constituted scarcely more than one of its many surfaces of contact the others being jurisprudence casuistics police  regulations etc on the other hand the psychopathological analyses of the nineteenth century which were also offered  as scientific knowledge connaissance of mental diseases played a very different much more important role in the  knowledge savoir of madness the role of model and decisionmaking authority Similarly scientific discourse or  scientific pretension does not perform the same function in the        204  economic knowledge of the seventeenth and in that of the nineteenth century In any discursive formation one finds a  specific relation between science and knowledge and instead of defining between them a relation of exclusion or  subtraction by trying to discover what in knowledge still eludes and resists science what in science is still compromised  by its proximity to and the influence of knowledge archaeological analysis must show positively how a science  functions in the element of knowledge   It is probably there in that space of interplay that the relations of ideology to the sciences are established The hold  of ideology over scientific discourse and the ideological functioning of the sciences are not articulated at the level of  their ideal structure even if they can be expressed in it in a more or less visible way nor at the level of their technical  use in a society although that society may obtain results from it nor at the level of the consciousness of the subjects     that built it up they are articulated where science is articulated upon knowledge If the question of ideology may be  asked of science it is in so far as science without being identified with knowledge but without either effacing or  excluding it is localized in it structures certain of its objects systematizes certain of its enunciations formalizes certain  of its concepts and strategies it is in so far as this development articulates knowledge modifies it and redistributes it on  the one hand and confirms it and gives it validity on the other it is in so far as science finds its place in a discursive  regularity in which by that very fact it is or is not deployed functions or does not function in a whole field of dis cursive practices In short the question of ideology that is asked of science is not the question of situations or practices  that it reflects more or less consciously nor is it the question of the possible use or misuse to which it could be put it is  the question of its existence as a discursive practice and of its functioning among other practices   Broadly speaking and setting aside all mediation and specificity it can be said that political economy has a role in  capitalist society that it serves the interests of the bourgeois class that it was made by and for that class and that it hears  the mark of its origins even in its concepts and logical architecture but any more precise description of the relations  between the epistemological structure of political economy and its ideological function must take into account the  analysis of the        205  discursive formation that gave rise to it and the group of objects concepts and theoretical choices that it had to develop  and systematize and one must then show how the discursive practice that gave rise to such a positivity functioned  among other practices that might have been of a discursive but also of a political or economic order   This enables us to advance a number of propositions     I Ideology is not exclusive of scientificity Few discourses have given so much place to ideology as clinical discourse  or that of political economy this is not a sufficiently good reason to treat the totality of their statements as being  undermined by error contradiction and a lack of objectivity   2Theoretical contradictions lacunae defects may indicate the ideological functioning of a science or of a  discourse with scientific pretensions they may enable us to determine at what point in the structure this functioning  takes effect But the analysis of this functioning must be made at the level of the positivity and of the relations  between the rules of formation and the structures of scientificity   3By correcting itself by rectifying its errors by clarifying its formulations discourse does not necessarily undo  its relations with ideology The role of ideology does not diminish as rigour increases and error is dissipated   4To tackle the ideological functioning of a science in order to reveal and to modify it is not to uncover the  philosophical presuppositions that may lie within it nor is it to return to the foundations that made it possible and  that legitimated it it is to question it as a discursive formation it is to tackle not the formal contradictions of its  propositions but the system of formation of its objects its types of enunciation its concepts its theoretical choices It  is to treat it as one practice among others   d DIFFERENT THRESHOLDS AND THEIR CHRONOLOGY   It is possible to describe several distinct emergences of a discursive formation The moment at which a discursive  practice achieves individuality and autonomy the moment therefore at which a single        206   system for the formation of statements is put into operation or the moment at which this system is transformed might be  called the threshold of positivity When in the operation of a discursive formation a group of statements is articulated  claims to validate even unsuccessfully norms of verification and coherence and when it exercises a dominant function  as a model a critique or a verification over knowledge we will say that the discursive formation crosses a threshold of  epistemologization When the epistemological figure thus outlined obeys a number of formal criteria when its statements  comply not only with archaeological rules of formation but also with certain laws for the construction of propositions we  will say that it has crossed a threshold of scientificity And when this scientific discourse is able in turn to define the  axioms necessary to it the elements that it uses the propositional structures that are legitimate to it and the  transformations that it accepts when it is thus able taking itself as a startingpoint to deploy the formal edifice that it  constitutes we will say that it has crossed the threshold of formalization   The distribution in time of these different thresholds their succession their possible coincidence or lack of it the  way in which they may govern one another or become implicated with one another the conditions in which in turn they  are established constitute for archaeology one of its major domains of exploration Their chronology in fact is neither  regular nor homogeneous The discursive formations do not cross them at regular intervals or at the same time thus  dividing up the history of human knowledge connaissances into different ages at a time when many positivities have     crossed the threshold of formalization many others have not yet attained that of scientificity or even of  epistemologization Moreover each discursive formation does not pass through these different thresholds in turn as  through the natural stages of biological maturation in which the only variable is the latency period or the length of the  intervals They are in fact events whose dispersion is not evolutive their unique order is one of the characteristics of  each discursive formation Here are a few examples of these differences   In some cases the threshold of positivity is crossed well before that of epistemologization thus psychopathology as a  discourse with scientific pretensions epistemologized at the beginning of the nineteenth        207  century with Pinel Heinroth and Esquirol a discursive practice that largely antedated it and that had acquired its  autonomy and system of regularity long before But there are also cases in which these two stages are confused in time  when the establishment of a positivity involves at the same time the emergence of an epistemological figure Sometimes  the thresholds of scientificity are linked with the transition from one positivity to another sometimes they are different  thus the transition from Natural History with the scientificity that was proper to it to biology as a science not of the  classification of beings but of specific correlations of different organisms did not take place at the time of Cuvier  without the transformation of one positivity into another on the other hand the experimental medicine of Claude  Bernard then the microbiology of Pasteur modified the type of scientificity required by morbid anatomy and  physiology without the discursive formation of clinical medicine as then established being made inoperable  Similarly the new scientificity established in the biological disciplines by evolutionism did not modify the biological  positivity that had been defined at the time of Cuvier In the case of economics the disconnexions are particularly  numerous In the seventeenth century one can recognize a threshold of positivity it almost coincides with the practice  and theory of mercantilism but its epistemologization did not occur until later at the very end of the century or the  beginning of the next century with Locke and Cantillon However the nineteenth century with Ricardo marks both a  new type of positivity a new form of epistemologization which were later to he modified in turn by Cournot and  Jevons at the very time that Marx was to reveal an entirely new discursive practice on the basis of political economy   If one recognizes in science only the linear accumulation of truths or the orthogenesis of reason and fails to recognize  in it a discursive practice that has its own levels its own thresholds its own various ruptures one can describe only a  single historical division which one adopts as a model to be applied at all times and for all forms of knowledge a  division between what is definitively or what is not yet scientific All the density of the disconnexions the dispersion of  the ruptures the shifts in their effects the play of the interdependence are reduced to the monotonous act of an endlessly  repeated foundation        208   There is perhaps only one science for which one can neither distinguish these different thresholds nor describe a  similar set of shifts mathematics the only discursive practice to have crossed at one and the same time the thresholds of  positivity epistemologization scientificity and formalization The very possibility of its existence implied that which in  all other sciences remains dispersed throughout history should be given at the outset its original positivity was to  constitute an already formalized discursive practice even if other formalizations were to be used later Hence the fact  that their establishment is both so enigmatic so little accessible to analysis so confined within the form of the absolute  beginning and so valid since it is valid both as an origin and as a foundation hence the fact that in the first gesture of  the first mathematician one saw the constitution of an ideality that has been deployed throughout history and has been  questioned only to be repeated and purified hence the fact that the beginning of mathematics is questioned not so much  as a historical event as for its validity as a principal of history and hence the fact that for all the other sciences the  description of its historical genesis its gropings and failures its late emergence is related to the metahistorical model of  a geometry emerging suddenly once and for all from the trivial practices of landmeasuring But if one takes the  establishment of mathematical discourse as a prototype for the birth and development of all the other sciences one runs  the risk of homogenizing all the unique forms of historicity of reducing to the authority of a single rupture all the  different thresholds that a discursive practice may cross and reproduce endlessly at every moment in time the problem  of origin the rights of the historicotranscendental analysis would thus be reinstated Mathematics has certainly served as  a model for most scientific discourses in their efforts to attain formal rigour and demonstrativity but for the historian  who questions the actual development of the sciences it is a bad example an example at least from which one cannot  generalize   e THE DIFFERENT TYPES OF THE HISTORY OF THE SCIENCES  The multiple thresholds that we have succeeded in mapping make     distinct forms of historical analysis possible First analysis at the level       209  of formalization it is this history that mathematics never ceases to recount about itself in the process of its own  development What it possesses at a given moment its domain its methods the objects that it defines the language that it  employs is never thrown back into the external field of nonscientificity but is constantly undergoing redefinition if  only as an area that has fallen into disuse or temporary sterility in the formal structure that mathematics constitutes this  past is revealed as a particular case a naive model a partial and insufficiently generalized sketch of a more abstract or  more powerful theory or one existing at a higher level mathematics retranscribes its real historical trajectory into the  vocabulary of vicinities dependences subordinations progressive formalizations and selfenveloping generalities For  this history of mathematics the history that is constituted by mathematics itself and which mathematics recounts about  itself the algebra of Diophantus is not an experience that remains in suspense it is a particular case of Algebra as we  have known it since Abel and Galois the Greek method of exhaustions was not an impasse that had to be escaped from it  is a naive model of integral calculus Each historical event has its own formal level and localization This is a recurrential  analysis which can be carried out only within a constituted science one that has crossed its threshold of formalization   The second type of historical analysis is situated at the threshold of scientificity and questions itself as to the way in  which it was crossed on the basis of various epistemological figures Its purpose is to discover for example how a  concept  still overlaid with metaphors or imaginary contents  was purified and accorded the status and function of a  scientific concept To discover how a region of experience that has already been mapped already partially articulated but  is still overlaid with immediate practical uses or values related to those uses was constituted as a scientific domain To  discover how in general a science was established over and against a prescientific level which both paved the way and  resisted it in advance how it succeeded in overcoming the obstacles and limitations that still stood in its way G  Bachelard and G Canguilhem have provided models of this kind of history Unlike recurrential analysis it has no need to  situate itself within the     footnote        Michel Serres Hermes ou la communication p 78  210        science itself to redistribute every episode in its construction to recount its formalization in the formal vocabulary that it  still possesses today indeed how could it do so since it shows what the science has freed itself from everything that it  has had to leave behind in its progress towards the threshold of scientificity Consequently this description takes as its  norm the fully constituted science the history that it recounts is necessarily concerned with the opposition of truth and  error the rational and the irrational the obstacle and fecundity purity and impurity the scientific and the nonscientific  It is an epistemological history of the sciences   The third type of historical analysis takes as its point of attack the threshold of epistemologization  the point of  cleavage between discursive formations defined by their positivity and epistemological figures that are not necessarily  all sciences and which may never in fact succeed in becoming sciences At this level scientificity does not serve as a  norm in this archaeological history what one is trying to uncover are discursive practices in so far as they give rise to a  corpus of knowledge in so far as they assume the status and role of a science To undertake a history of the sciences at  this level is not to describe discursive formations without regard to epistemological structures it is to show how the  establishment of a science and perhaps its transition to formalization have come about in a discursive formation and in  modifications to its positivity Such an analysis sets out therefore to outline the history of the sciences on the basis of a  description of discursive practices to define how in accordance with which regularity and as a result of which  modification it was able to give rise to the processes of epistemologization to attain the norms of scientificity and  perhaps to reach the threshold of formalization In seeking the level of discursive practice in the historical density of the  sciences one is not trying to place the discursive practice at some deep original level one is not trying to place it at the  level of lived experience on this earth which is given irregular and fragmented before all geometry in the heaven that  glitters through the grid of all astronomies  one is trying to reveal between positivities knowledge epistemological  figures and sciences a whole set of differences relations gaps shifts independences autonomies and the way in which  they articulate their own historicities on one another        211  The analysis of discursive formations of positivities and knowledge in their relations with epistemological figures   and with the sciences is what has been called to distinguish it from other possible forms of the history of the sciences  the analysis of the episteme This episteme may be suspected of being something like a worldview a slice of history     common to all branches of knowledge which imposes on each one the same norms and postulates a general stage of  reason a certain structure of thought that the men of a particular period cannot escape  a great body of legislation  written once and for all by some anonymous hand By episteme we mean in fact the total set of relations that unite at a  given period the discursive practices that give rise to epistemological figures sciences and possibly formalized  systems the way in which in each of these discursive formations the transitions to epistemologization scientificity and  formalization are situated and operate the distribution of these thresholds which may coincide be subordinated to one  another or be separated by shifts in time the lateral relations that may exist between epistemological figures or sciences  in so far as they belong to neighbouring but distinct discursive practices The episteme is not a form of knowledge  connaissance or type of rationality which crossing the boundaries of the most varied sciences manifests the sovereign  unity of a subject a spirit or a period it is the totality of relations that can be discovered for a given period between the  sciences when one analyses them at the level of discursive regularities   The description of the episteme presents several essential characteristics therefore it opens up an inexhaustible field  and can never be closed its aim is not to reconstitute the system of postulates that governs all the branches of  knowledge connaissances of a given period but to cover an indefinite field of relations Moreover the episteme is not  a motionless figure that appeared one day with the mission of effacing all that preceded it it is a constantly moving set  of articulations shifts and coincidences that are established only to give rise to others As a set of relations between  sciences epistemological figures positivities and discursive practices the episteme makes it possible to grasp the set of  constraints and limitations which at a given moment are imposed on discourse but this limitation is not the negative  limitation that opposes knowledge connaissance to ignorance reasoning to imagination armed experience to fidelity to  appearances and fantasy to inferences and        212  deductions the episteme is not what may be known at a given period due account taken of inadequate techniques mental  attitudes or the limitations imposed by tradition it is what in the positivity of discursive practices makes possible the  existence of epistemological figures and sciences Lastly we see that the analysis of the episteme is not a way of  returning to the critical question given the existence of something like a science what is its legitimacy it is a  questioning that accepts the fact of science only in order to ask the question what it is for that science to be a science In  the enigma of scientific discourse what the analysis of the episteme questions is not its right to be a science but the fact  that it exists And the point at which it separates itself off from all the philosophies of knowledge connaissance is that it  relates this fact not to the authority of an original act of giving which establishes in a transcendental subject the fact and  the right but to the processes of a historical practice   f OTHER ARCHAEOLOG I ES   One question remains in suspense could one conceive of an archaeological analysis that would reveal the regularity of a  body of knowledge but which would not set out to analyse it in terms of epistemological figures and sciences Is an  orientation towards the episteme the only one open to archaeology Must archaeology be  exclusively  a certain way  of questioning the history of the sciences In other words by confirming itself up to now to the region of scientific  discourses has archaeology been governed by some insuperable necessity  or has it provided an outline on the basis of  a particular example of forms of analysis that may have a much wider application   At the moment I am not sufficiently advanced in my task to answer this question But I can readily imagine  subject  to a great deal of further exploration and examination  archaeologies that might develop in different directions There  is for example the archaeological description of sexuality And I can see very well how it might be orientated towards  the episteme one would show how in the nineteenth century such epistemological figures as the biology and psychology  of sexuality were formed and how a discourse of a scientific type was established through the rupture brought about by  Freud But I   213     can also see another possible direction for analysis instead of studying the sexual behaviour of men at a given period  by seeking its law in a social structure in a collective unconscious or in a certain moral attitude instead of describing  what men thought of sexuality what religious interpretation they gave it to what extent they approved or disapproved of  it what conflicts of opinion or morality it gave rise to one would ask oneself whether in this behaviour as in these  representations a whole discursive practice is not at work whether sexuality quite apart from any orientation towards a  scientific discourse is not a group of objects that can be talked about or that it is forbidden to talk about a field of  possible enunciations whether in lyrical or legal language a group of concepts which can no doubt be presented in the  elementary form of notions or themes a set of choices which may appear in the coherence of behavior or in systems of  prescription  Such an archaeology would show if it succeeded in its task how the prohibitions exclusions limitations  values freedoms and transgressions of sexuality all its manifestations verbal or otherwise are linked to a particular  discursive practice It would reveal not of course as the ultimate truth of sexuality but as one of the dimensions in  accordance with which one can describe it a certain way of speaking and one would show how this way of speaking is  invested not in scientific discourses but in a system of prohibitions and values An analysis that would be carried out not  in the direction of the episteme but in that of what we might call the ethical  But here is an example of another possible orientation In analysing a painting one can reconstitute the latent discourse   of the painter one can try to recapture the murmur of his intentions which are not transcribed into words but into lines  surfaces and colours one can try to uncover the implicit philosophy that is supposed to form his view of the world It is  also possible to question science or at least the opinions of the period and to try to recognize to what extent they appear  in the painters work Archaeological analysis would have another aim it would try to discover whether space distance  depth colour light proportions volumes and contours were not at the period in question considered named  enunciated and conceptualized in a discursive practice and whether the knowledge that this discursive practice gives rise  to was not embodied perhaps in theories and        214  speculations in forms of teaching and codes of practice but also in processes techniques and even in the very gesture of  the painter It would not set out to show that the painting is a certain way of meaning or saying that is peculiar in that it  dispenses with words It would try to show that at least in one of its dimensions it is discursive practice that is embodied  in techniques and effects In this sense the painting is not a pure vision that must then he transcribed into the materiality  of space nor is it a naked gesture whose silent and eternally empty meanings must be freed from subsequent  interpretations It is shot through  and independently of scientific knowledge connaissance and philosophical themes   with the positivity of a knowledge savoir   It seems to me that one might also carry out an analysis of the same type on political knowledge One would try to  show whether the political behavior of a society a group or a class is not shot through with a particular describable  discursive practice This positivity would obviously not coincide either with the political theories of the period or with  economic determinations it would define the element in politics that can become an object of enunciation the forms that  this enunciation may take the concepts that are employed in it and the strategic choices that are made in it Instead of  analysing this knowledge  which is always possible  in the direction of the episteme that it can give rise to one  would analyse it in the direction of behaviour struggles conflicts decisions and tactics One would thus reveal a body of  political knowledge that is not some kind of secondary theorizing about practice nor the application of theory Since it is  regularly formed by a discursive practice that is deployed among other practices and is articulated upon them it is not an  expression that more or less adequately reflects a number of objective data or real practices It is inscribed from the  outset in the field of different practices in which it finds its specificity its functions and its network of dependences If  such a description were possible there would be no need of course to pass through the authority of an individual or  collective consciousness in order to grasp the place of articulation of a political practice and theory there would he no  need to try to discover to what extent this consciousness may on the one hand express silent conditions and on the  other show that it is susceptible to theoretical truths one would not need to pose the psychological problem of an act of  consciousness     215   prise de conscience instead one would analyse the formation and transformations of a body of  knowledge The question for example would not be to determine from what moment a  revolutionary consciousness appears nor the respective roles of economic conditions and theor etical elucidations in the genesis of this consciousness it would not attempt to retrace the general  and exemplary biography of revolutionary man or to find the origins of his project but it would  try to explain the formation of a discursive practice and a body of revolutionary knowledge that  are expressed in behaviour and strategies which give rise to a theory of society and which     operate the interference and mutual transformation of that behaviour and those strategies  To the questions posed above  Is archaeology concerned only with sciences Is it always an   analysis of scientific discourse  we can now give a reply in each case in the negative What  archaeology tries to describe is not the specific structure of science but the very different domain  of knowledge Moreover although it is concerned with knowledge in its relation to  epistemological figures and the sciences it may also question knowledge in a different direction  and describe it in a different set of relations The orientation towards the episteme has been the  only one to be explored so far The reason for this is that because of a gradient that no doubt  characterizes our cultures discursive formations are constantly becoming epistemologized It is  by questioning the sciences their history their strange unity their dispersion and their ruptures  that the domain of positivities was able to appear it is in the interstice of scientific discourses that  we were able to grasp the play of discursive formations It is hardly surprising therefore that the  most fruitful region the one most open to archaeological description should have been that  Classical age which from the Renaissance to the nineteenth century saw the epistemologization  of so many positivities nor is it surprising that the discursive formations and specific regularities  of knowledge are outlined precisely where the levels of scientificity and formalization were most  difficult to attain But that was no more than a preferential point of attack it is not for  archaeology an obligatory domain       219       Part V Conclusion  CONCLUSION   Throughout this book you have been at great pains to dissociate yourself from structuralism or at least from what is  ordinarily understood by that term You have tried to show that you used neither the methods nor the concepts of  structuralism that you make no reference to the procedures of linguistic description that you are not concerned with  formalization But what do these differences amount to if not that you have failed to avail yourself of what is most  positive most rigorous and most revealing in structural analysis That the domain that you have tried to deal with is not  susceptible to this kind of enterprise and that its richness has constantly eluded the schemata in which you wished to  enclose it And with apparent unconcern you are now trying to disguise the impotence of your method you are now  presenting as an explicitly intended difference the unconquerable distance that separates you and will always separate  you from a true structural analysis   For you have not managed to deceive us It is true that in the void left by the methods that you have chosen not to use  you have precipitated a whole series of notions that seem quite alien to the concepts now accepted by those who describe  languages myths or works of literature you have spoken of formations positivities knowledge discursive practices a  whole panoply of terms whose uniqueness and        220   marvellous powers you were proud to point out at every step But would you have invented so many oddities if you had  not tried to apply in a domain that was irreducible to them some of the fundamental themes of structuralism  and those  very themes that constitute its most debatable and philosophically dubious postulates It is as if you had used not the  empirical serious work of structural analysis but two or three themes that are really extrapolations rather than necessary  principles   You have tried to reduce the dimensions proper to discourse ignore its specific irregularity hide what initiative and  freedom it possesses and make up for the imbalance that it sets up within the language longue you have tried to close  this openness Like a certain form of linguistics you have tried to dispense with the speaking subject you believed that  one could cut off from discourse all its anthropological references and treat it as if it had never been formulated by  anyone as if it had not come about in particular circumstances as if it were not imbued with representations as if it were     addressed to no one Lastly you have applied to it a principle of simultaneity you have refused to see that discourse  unlike the language longue perhaps is essentially historical that it was made up not of available elements but of real  successive events that it cannot be analysed outside the time in which it occurred     You are quite right I misunderstood the transcendence of discourse in describing it I refused to refer it to a  subjectivity I did not give primary consideration as if it ought to be its general form to its diachronic character But this  was not intended to extend beyond the domain of the language longue concepts and methods that had been tested  within it If I spoke of discourse it was not to show that the mechanisms or processes of the language longue were  entirely preserved in it but rather to reveal in the density of verbal performances the diversity of the possible levels of  analysis to show that in addition to methods of linguistic structuration or interpretation one could draw up a specific  description of statements of their formation and of the regularities proper to discourse If I suspended all reference to the  speaking subject it was not to discover laws of construction or forms that could be applied in the same way by all  speaking subjects nor was        221  it to give voice to the great universal discourse that is common to all men at a particular period On the contrary my aim  was to show what the differences consisted of how it was possible for men within the same discursive practice to speak  of different objects to have contrary opinions and to make contradictory choices my aim was also to show in what way  discursive practices were distinguished from one another in short I wanted not to exclude the problem of the subject  but to define the positions and functions that the subject could occupy in the diversity of discourse Lastly as you have  observed I did not deny history but held in suspense the general empty category of change in order to reveal  transformations at different levels I reject a uniform model of temporalization in order to describe for each discursive  practice its rules of accumulation exclusion reactivation its own forms of derivation and its specific modes of  connexion over various successions   So I did not wish to carry the structuralist enterprise beyond its legitimate limits And you must admit that I never  once used the word structure in The Order of Things But let us leave off our polemics about structuralism they  hardly survive in areas now deserted by serious workers this particular controversy which might have been so fruiftul  is now acted out only by mimes and tumblers     Its no use trying to avoid these polemics you wont escape the problem so easily For the problem does not  concern structuralism I recognize the value of its insights of course when it is a question of analysing a language  longue mythologies folktales poems dreams works of literature even films perhaps structural description reveals  relations that could not otherwise be isolated it makes it possible to define recurrent elements with their forms of  opposition and their criteria of individualization it also makes it possible to lay down laws of construction  equivalences and rules of transformation And despite a number of reservations that I had at the beginning I now have  no difficulty in accepting that mans languages longues his unconscious and his imagination are governed by laws of  structure But what I absolutely cannot accept is what you are doing I cannot accept that one can analyse scientific  discourses in their succession without referring them to something like a constituent activity without recognizing        222   even in their hesitations the opening of an original project or a fundamental teleology without discovering the profound  continuity that links them and leads them to the point at which we can grasp them I cannot accept that one can analyse  the development of reason in this way and free the history of thought from all taint of subjectivity Let us examine the  problem more closely I agree that one can speak in terms of elements and rules of construction of language longue in  general  at least of that language of other times and places which is that of myths or even of that nevertheless rather  strange language which is that of our unconscious or of our literary works but the language of our knowledge that  language which we are using here and now the structural discourse itself that enables us to analyse so many other  languages langages that language which in its historical density we regard as irreducible You surely cannot forget  that it is on the basis of that language with its slow genesis and the obscure development that has brought it to its present  state that we can speak of other discourses in terms of structures it is that language which has given us the possibility  and the right to do so it forms the blind spot on the basis of which things around us are arranged as we see them today I  dont mind one dealing with elements relations and discontinuities when analysing IndoEuropean myths or the tragedies  of Racine and I can even accept that one should dispense as far as one can with a discussion of the speaking subjects  but I dispute that these successes give one the right to turn the analysis back on to the forms of discourse that made them     possible and to question the very locus in which we are speaking today The history of those analyses in which  subjectivity eludes one retains its own transcendence     It seems to me that the difference between us lies there much more than in the overdiscussed question of  structuralism As you know I have no great liking for interpretation but allow me as a kind of game to say what I  understand you to have said earlier Of course you say we must now admit despite all the attacks of the arrieregarde  that one formalizes deductive discourses of course we have to admit that one describes not so much the history of a soul  not so much a project of existence as the architecture of a philosophical system of course whatever we think about it  we have to tolerate those analyses      223   that link literary oeuvres not to the lived experience of an individual but to the structures of the language longue Of  course we have had to abandon all those discourses that once led us to the sovereignty of consciousness But what we  have lost over the last halfcentury we are hoping to recover in the second degree by means of the analysis of those  analyses or at least by the fundamental questioning that we apply to them We will ask them where they came from  towards what historical destination they are moving without being aware of it what naivety blinds them to the conditions  that make them possible and what metaphysical enclosure encloses their rudimentary positivism And so in the end it will  not matter that the unconscious is not as we believed and affirmed the implicit edge of consciousness it will not matter  that a mythology is no longer a worldview and that a novel is something other than the outer slope of a lived experience  for the reason that establishes all these new truths is under strict supervision neither itself nor its past nor that which  makes it possible nor that which makes it ours escapes the attribution of transcendence For it is to it now  and we are  determined never to abandon this  that we will now pose the question of the origin the first constitution the teleo logical horizon temporal continuity It is that thought which is now becoming ours that we will maintain in historico transcendental dominance That is why if we must tolerate all these structuralisms whether we like it or not we will not  allow any taint to that history of thought that is our own history we will not allow the unravelling of those transcendental  threads that have hound it since the nineteenth century to the problem of origin and subjectivity To whomsoever  approaches that fortress in which we have taken refuge and which we are determined to defend and to hold we repeat  with a gesture that wards off all profanation Noli tangere   But I have obstinately gone on Not that I am either certain of victory or sure of my weapons But because it seemed to  me that for the moment the essential task was to free the history of thought from its subjection to transcendence For me  the problem was certainly not how to structuralize it by applying to the development of knowledge or to the genesis of  the sciences categories that had proved themselves in the domain of language longue My aim was to analyse this  history in the discontinuity that no teleology would reduce in advance to map        224   it in a dispersion that no preestablished horizon would embrace to allow it to be deployed in an anonymity on which no  transcendental constitution would impose the form of the subject to open it up to a temporality that would not promise  the return of any dawn My aim was to cleanse it of all transcendental narcissism it had to be freed from that circle of the  lost origin and rediscovered where it was imprisoned it had to be shown that the history of thought could not have this  role of revealing the transcendental moment that rational mechanics has not possessed since Kant mathematical idealities  since Husserl and the meanings of the perceived world since MerleauPonty  despite the efforts that had been made to  find it here   And I think that really despite the element of doubt introduced by our apparent dispute over structuralism we  understood each other perfectly I mean each of us understood perfectly what the other was trying to do It is quite  normal that you should defend the rights of a continuous history open both to the application of a teleology and to the  endless processes of causality but it was not to protect it from a structural invasion that failed to recognize its movement  spontaneity and internal dynamism in fact you were trying to preserve the powers of a constituent consciousness since  it was really they that were in question But this defence was to take place elsewhere and not in the same place as the     discussion itself for if you recognize the right of a piece of empirical research some fragment of history to challenge the  transcendental dimension then you have ceded the main point Hence a series of shifts or displacements To treat  archaeology as a search for the origin for formal a prioris for founding acts in short as a sort of historical  phenomenology when on the contrary its aim is to free history from the grip of phenomenology and then to object that  it fails in its task and that it never discovers more than a series of empirical facts Then to contrast archaeological  description and its concern to establish thresholds ruptures and transformations with the true work of historians which  is to reveal continuities when this ceased to be the concern of historians decades ago and then to reproach it for its lack  of concern for empiricities And then to regard it as an enterprise whose aim is to describe cultural totalities to  homogenize the most obvious differences and to rediscover the universality of constrictive forms when its aim is to  define the unique specificity of        225   discursive practices and then to object to differences changes and mutations Lastly to regard it as an importation of  structuralism into the domain of history when its methods and concepts cannot possibly be confused with structuralism  and then to show that it cannot function as a true structural analysis   This whole play of displacements and misunderstandings is perfectly coherent and necessary It brought with it a  secondary benefit being able to approach from an oblique angle all those forms of structuralism that had to be tolerated  and that could no longer be resisted and to say to them You see what youll expose yourselves to if you touch those  domains that are still ours your methods may have some validity elsewhere but they would soon be brought to     recognize their limitations all the concrete content that you would like to analyse would elude them you would be  forced to give up your prudent empiricism and against your will you would fall into a strange ontology of structure  So be prudent enough to keep to those domains which you have no doubt conquered but which we will pretend to have  conceded to you since we have fixed their boundaries But the major benefit of course is that it conceals the crisis in  which we have been involved for so long and which is constantly growing more serious a crisis that concerns that  transcendental reflexion with which philosophy since Kant has identified itself which concerns that theme of the origin  that promise of the return by which we avoid the difference of our present which concerns an anthropological thought  that orders all these questions around the question of mans being and allows us to avoid an analysis of practice which  concerns all humanist ideologies which above all concerns the status of the subject It is this discussion that you would  like to suppress and from which you hope I think to divert attention by pursuing the pleasant games of genesis and  system synchrony and development relation and cause structure and history Are you sure you are not practising a  theoretical metathesis     Let us suppose that our dispute is where you say it is let us suppose that our aims are to attack or to defend the last  bastion of transcendental thought and let us admit that this discussion is in fact situated in the crisis you describe what  then is the title of your discourse Where does it come from and from where does it derive its     226   right to speak How could it be legitimated If you have done nothing more than carry out an empirical inquiry devoted  to the appearance and transformation of discourses if you have described groups of statements epistemological figures  the historical forms of a body of knowledge how can you escape the naivety of all positivisms And how could your  enterprise prevail against the question of origin and the necessary recourse to a constituent subject But if you claim that  you are opening up a radical interrogation if you wish to place your discourse at the level at which we place ourselves  you know very well that it will enter our game and in turn extend the very dimension that it is trying to free itself from  Either it does not reach us or we claim it In any case you have promised to tell us what these discourses are that you  have been pursuing so obstinately for the past ten years without ever bothering to define their status In short what are  they history or philosophy     I admit that this question embarrasses me more than your earlier objections I am not entirely surprised by it but I  would have preferred to leave it in suspense a little longer This is because for the moment and as far ahead as I can see  my discourse far from determining the locus in which it speaks is avoiding the ground on which it could find support It  is a discourse about discourses but it is not trying to find in them a hidden law a concealed origin that it only remains to  free nor is it trying to establish by itself taking itself as a startingpoint the general theory of which they would be the  concrete models It is trying to deploy a dispersion that can never be reduced to a single system of differences a  scattering that is not related to absolute axes of reference it is trying to operate a decentring that leaves no privilege to  any centre The role of such a discourse is not to dissipate oblivion to rediscover in the depths of things said at the very  place in which they are silent the moment of their birth whether this is seen as their empirical creation or the  transcendental act that gives them origin it does not set out to be a recollection of the original or a memory of the truth  On the contrary its task is to make differences to constitute them as objects to analyse them and to define their concept  Instead of travelling over the field of discourses in order to recreate the suspended totalizations for its own use instead of  seeking in what has been said that other   227  hidden discourse which nevertheless remains the same and instead of playing endlessly with allegory and tautology it  is continually making differentiations it is a diagnosis If philosophy is memory or a return of the origin what I am doing  cannot in any way be regarded as philosophy and if the history of thought consists in giving life to halfeffaced figures  what I am doing is not history either     From what you have just said one must at least deduce that your archaeology is not a science You allow it to  fluctuate with the uncertain status of a description Yet another of those discourses that would like to be taken as a  discipline still in its early stages no doubt which gives their authors the double advantage of not having to establish their  explicit rigorous scientificity and of opening up for it a future generality that frees it from the hazards of its birth yet  another of those projects that justify themselves on the basis of what they are not always leaving their essential task the  moment of their verification and the definitive establishment of their coherence until later yet another of those  foundations so many of which have been announced since the nineteenth century for we know very well that in the  modern theoretical field what one is pleased to invent are not demonstrable systems but disciplines for which one opens  up possibilities outlines a programme and leaves its future development to others But no sooner have they been outlined     than they disappear together with their authors And the field that they were supposed to tend remains sterile for ever     It is true that I have never presented archaeology as a science or even as the beginnings of a future science And I  have tried to draw up a survey  and in the process to make a good many corrections  of the work that I had done in  certain fields of concrete research rather than produce plans for some future building The word archaeology is not  supposed to carry any suggestion of anticipation it simply indicates a possible line of attack for the analysis of verbal  performances the specification of a level  that of the statement and the archive the determination and illumination of a  domain  the enunciative regularities the positivities the application of such concepts as rules of formation  archaeological derivation and historical a priori But in almost all        228  its dimensions and over almost all its crests the enterprise is related to the sciences and to analyses of a scientific type  or to theories subject to rigorous criteria First of all it is related to the sciences that are constituted and establish their  norms in the knowledge archaeologically described for the archaeological enterprise these sciences are so many  scienceobjects as morbid anatomy philology political economy and biology have already been It is also related to  scientific forms of analysis but is distinguished from them either in level domain or methods and juxtaposed to them  by characteristic lines of division by seizing out of the mass of things said upon the statement defined as a function of  realization of the verbal performance it distinguishes itself from a search whose privileged field is linguistic  competence while such a description constitutes a generative model in order to define the acceptability of statements  archaeology tries to establish rules of formation in order to define the conditions of their realization between these two  modes of analysis there are therefore a number of analogies but there are also a number of differences in particular  concerning the possible level of formalization  in any case for archaeology a generative grammar plays the role of a  related analysis Moreover in their deployment and in the fields that they cover archaeological descriptions are  articulated upon other disciplines in seeking to define outside all reference to a psychological or constituent  subjectivity the different positions of the subject that may be involved in statements archaeology touches on a question  that is being posed today by psychoanalysis in trying to reveal the rules of formation of concepts the modes of  succession connexion and coexistence of statements it touches on the problem of epistemological structures in  studying the formation of objects the fields in which they emerge and are specified in studying too the conditions of  appropriation of discourses it touches on the analysis of social formations For archaeology these are so many  correlative spaces Lastly in so far as it is possible to constitute a general theory of productions archaeology as the  analysis of the rules proper to the different discursive practices will find what might be called its enveloping theory   If I situate archaeology among so many other already constituted discourses it is not in order to give it some kind of  status by association that it would be incapable of acquiring in isolation it is not in order to        229  give it a definitive place in an unmoving constellation but in order to reveal with the archive the discursive formations  the positivities the statements and their conditions of formation a specific domain A domain that has not so far been  made the object of any analysis at least of what is most specific and most irreducible to interpretations and  formalizations about it but a domain that has no means of guaranteeing  at the still rudimentary stage of mapping at  which I am at present  that it will remain stable and autonomous After all it may be that archaeology is doing nothing  more than playing the role of an instrument that makes it possible to articulate in a less imprecise way than in the past  the analysis of social formations and epistemological descriptions or which makes it possible to relate an analysis of the  positions of the subject to a theory of the history of the sciences or which makes it possible to situate the place of  intersection between a general theory of production and a generative analysis of statements Lastly it may turn out that  archaeology is the name given to a part of our contemporary theoretical conjuncture Whether this conjuncture is giving  rise to an individualizable discipline whose initial characteristics and overall limits are being outlined here or whether it  is giving rise to a set of problems whose present coherence does not mean that it will not be taken up later elsewhere in a  different way at a higher level or using different methods I am in no position at the moment to decide And to tell you  the truth it is probably not up to me to decide I accept that my discourse may disappear with the figure that has borne it  so far     You make curious use of the freedom that you question in others For you give yourself the whole field of a free  space that you even refuse to qualify But are you forgetting the care with which you enclosed the discourse of others  within systems of rules Are you forgetting all those constraints that you described so meticulously Have you not  deprived individuals of the right to intervene personally in the positivities in which their discourses are situated You  have linked their slightest words to obligations that condemn their slightest innovations to conformity You make  revolution very easy for yourself but very difficult for others It might he better if you had a clearer awareness of the  conditions in which you speak and a greater confidence in the real action of men and in their possibilities          230   Im afraid you are making a double mistake about the discursive practices that I have tried to  define and about the role that you yourself accord to human freedom The positivities that I have  tried to establish must not be understood as a set of determinations imposed from the outside on  the thought of individuals or inhabiting it from the inside in advance as it were they constitute  rather the set of conditions in accordance with which a practice is exercised in accordance with  which that practice gives rise to partially or totally new statements and in accordance with which  it can be modified These positivities are not so much limitations imposed on the initiative of  subjects as the field in which that initiative is articulated without however constituting its  centre rules that it puts into operation without it having invented or formulated them relations  that provide it with a support without it being either their final result or their point of  convergence It is an attempt to reveal discursive practices in their complexity and density to  show that to speak is to do something  something other than to express what one thinks to  translate what one knows and something other than to play with the structures of a language  longue to show that to add a statement to a preexisting series of statements is to perform a  complicated and costly gesture which involves conditions and not only a situation a context and  motives and rules not the logical and linguistic rules of construction to show that a change in  the order of discourse does not presuppose new ideas a little invention and creativity a different  mentality but transformations in a practice perhaps also in neighbouring practices and in their  common articulation I have not denied  far from it  the possibility of changing discourse I have  deprived the sovereignty of the subject of the exclusive and instantaneous right to it   And now I should like to ask you a question how do you see change or let us say revolution  at least in the scientific order and in the field of discourses if you link it with the themes of  meaning project origin and return constituent subject in short with the entire thematic that  ensures for history the universal presence of the Logos What possibility do you accord it if you  analyse it in accordance with dynamic biological evolutionist metaphors in which the difficult  specific problem of historical mutation is usually dissolved More precisely still what political  status can you give to discourse if you see        231  in it merely a thin transparency that shines for an instant at the limit of things and thoughts Has not the practice of  revolutionary discourse and scientific discourse in Europe over the past two hundred years freed you from this idea that  words are wind an external whisper a beating of wings that one has difficulty in hearing in the serious matter of history  Or must we conclude that in order to refuse this lesson you are determined to misunderstand discursive practices in their  own existence and that you wished to maintain in spite of that lesson a history of the mind of rational knowledge  ideas and opinions What is that fear which makes you reply in terms of consciousness when someone talks to you about  a practice its conditions its rules and its historical transformations What is that fear which makes you seek beyond all  boundaries ruptures shifts and divisions the great historicotranscendental destiny of the Occident   It seems to me that the only reply to this question is a political one But let us leave that to one side for today Perhaps  we will take it up again soon in another way   This book was written simply in order to overcome certain preliminary difficulties I know as well as anyone how  thankless is the task that I undertook some ten years ago I know how irritating it can he to treat discourses in terms not  of the gentle silent intimate consciousness that is expressed in them but of an obscure set of anonymous rules How  unpleasant it is to reveal the limitations and necessities of a practice where one is used to seeing in all its pure  transparency the expression of genius and freedom How provocative it is to treat as a set of transformations this history  of discourses which until now has been animated by the reassuring metaphors of life or the intentional continuity of the  lived How unbearable it is in view of how much of himself everyone wishes to put thinks he is putting of himself into  his own discourse when he speaks how unbearable it is to cut up analyse combine rearrange all these texts that have  now returned from silence without ever the transfigured face of the author appearing What All those words piled up  one after another all those marks made on all that paper and presented to innumerable pairs of eyes all that concern to  make them survive beyond the gesture that articulated them so much piety expended in preserving them and inscribing  them in mens memories  all that and nothing remaining of the poor          232  hand that traced them of the anxiety that sought appeasement in them of that completed life that has nothing but them to  survive in Is not discourse in its most profound determination a trace And is its murmur not the place of  insubstantial immortalities Must we admit that the time of discourse is not the time of consciousness extrapolated to the  dimensions of history or the time of history present in the form of consciousness Must I suppose that in my discourse I  can have no survival And that in speaking I am not banishing my death but actually establishing it or rather that I am  abolishing all interiority in that exterior that is so indifferent to my life and so neutral that it makes no distinction  between my life and my death   I understand the unease of all such people They have probably found it difficult enough to recognize that their history  their economics their social practices the language langue that they speak the mythology of their ancestors even the  stories that they were told in their childhood are governed by rules that are not all given to their consciousness they can  hardly agree to being dispossessed in addition of that discourse in which they wish to be able to say immediately and  directly what they think believe or imagine they prefer to deny that discourse is a complex differentiated practice  governed by analysable rules and transformations rather than be deprived of that tender consoling certainty of being  able to change if not the world if not life at least their meaning simply with a fresh word that can come only from  themselves and remain for ever close to the source So many things have already eluded them in their language  langage they have no wish to see what they say go the same way at all costs they must preserve that tiny fragement of  discourse  whether written or spoken  whose fragile uncertain existence must perpetuate their lives They cannot  bear and one cannot but sympathize to hear someone saying Discourse is not life its time is not your time in it you  will not be reconciled to death you may have killed God beneath the weight of all that you have said but dont imagine  that with all that you are saying you will make a man that will live longer than he   INDEX  a priori 8 Abel N 209 accounts book 93  accumulation 13841  actuality domain 68  Adanson

appearing at times as a sacred obligation   to be neglected at grave peril at other times as a sort of criminal activity  entailing perils of equal gravity   To account for this dual aspect of ritual sacrificethe legitimate and  the illegitimate the public and the all but covertHenri Hubert and  Marcel Mauss in their Essay on the Nature and Function of Sacri fice1 adduce the sacred character of the victim Because the victim is  sacred it is criminal to kill himbut the victim is sacred only because  he is to be killed Here is a circular line of reasoning that at a somewhat  later date would be dignified by the sonorous term ambivalence Per suasive and authoritative as that term still appears it has been so extra ordinarily abused in our century that perhaps we may now recognize  how little light it sheds on the subject of sacrifice Certainly it provides  no real explanation When we speak of ambivalence we are only point ing out a problem that remains to be solved   If sacrifice resembles criminal violence we may say that there is  inversely hardly any form of violence that cannot be described in  terms of sacrificeas Greek tragedy clearly reveals It has often been  observed that the tragic poets cast a glimmering veil of rhetoric over  the sordid realities of life True enoughbut sacrifice and murder  would not lend themselves to this game of reciprocal substitution if  they were not in some way related Although it is so obvious that it  may hardly seem worth mentioning where sacrifice is concerned first  appearances count for little are quickly brushed asideand should  therefore receive special attention Once one has made up ones mind  that sacrifice is an institution essentially if not entirely symbolic one  can say anything whatsoever about it It is a subject that lends itself to  insubstantial theorizing   Sacrifice contains an element of mystery And if the pieties of classi cal humanists lull our curiosity to sleep the company of the ancient   1 Henri Hubert and Marcel Mauss Sacrifice Its Nature and Function Chicago  1968     2 Violence and the Sacred   authors keeps it alert The ancient mystery remains as impenetrable as  ever From the manner in which the moderns treat the subject of  sacrifice it would be hard to know whether distraction detachment  or some sort of secret discretion shapes their thinking There seems to  be yet another mystery here Why for example do we never explore  the relationship between sacrifice and violence   Recent studies suggest that the physiology of violence varies little  from one individual to another even from one culture to another  According to Anthony Storr nothing resembles an angry cat or man  so much as another angry cat or man2 If violence did indeed play a  role in sacrifice at least at one particular stage of the ritual we would  have a significant clue to the whole subject Here would be a factor to  some extent independent of those cultural variables that are often un known to us or only dimly known or perhaps less familiar than we  like to think   Once aroused the urge to violence triggers certain physical changes  that prepare mens bodies for battle This set toward violence lingers  on it should not be regarded as a simple reflex that ceases with the  removal of the initial stimulus Storr remarks that it is more difficult to  quell an impulse toward violence than to rouse it especially within the  normal framework of social behavior   Violence is frequently called irrational It has its reasons however  and can marshal some rather convincing ones when the need arises Yet  these reasons cannot be taken seriously no matter how valid they may  appear Violence itself will discard them if the initial object remains  persistently out of reach and continues to provoke hostility When  unappeased violence seeks and always finds a surrogate victim The  creature that excited its fury is abruptly replaced by another chosen  only because it is vulnerable and close at hand   There are many indications that this tendency to seek out surrogate  objects is not limited to human violence Konrad Lorenz makes refer ence to a species of fish that if deprived of its natural enemies the  male rivals with whom it habitually disputes territorial rights turns  its aggression against the members of its own family and destroys  them3 Joseph de Maistre

ethnology offers many examples of this sort of intuitive  behavior In some pastoral communities where sacrifice is practiced  the cattle are intimately associated with the daily life of the inhabi tants Two peoples of the Upper Nile for examplethe Nuers  observed by E E EvansPritchard and the Dinka studied at a some what later date by Godfrey Lienhardtmaintain a bovine society in  their midst that parallels their own and is structured in the same  fashion5   The Nuer vocabulary is rich in words describing the ways of cattle  and covering the economic and practical as well as the poetic and  ritualistic aspects of these beasts This wealth of expression makes  possible a precise and finely nuanced relationship between the cattle  on the one hand and the human community on the other The animals  color the shape of their horns their age sex and lineage are all duly  noted and remembered sometimes as far back as five generations The  cattle are thereby differentiated in such a way as to create a scale of  values that approximates human distinctions and represents a virtual  duplicate of human society Among the names bestowed on each man  is one that also belongs to the animal whose place in the herd is most  similar to the place the man occupies in the tribe   The quarrels between various subgroups of the tribes frequently  involve cattle All fines and interest payments are computed in terms of  head of cattle and dowries are apportioned in herds In fact Evans Pritchard maintains that in order to understand the Nuer one must  chercher la vachelook to the cows A sort of symbiosis the  term is also EvansPritchards exists between this tribe and their cat tle offering an extreme and almost grotesque example of the closeness  that characteristically prevails between pastoral peoples and their  flocks   Fieldwork and subsequent theoretical speculation lead us back to the  hypothesis of substitution as the basis for the practice of sacrifice This  notion pervades

well be said to have  a sacrificial cast   t VIOLENCE IS NOT TO BE DENIED but it can be  diverted to another object something it can sink its teeth into Such  perhaps is one of the meanings of the story of Cain and Abel The  Bible offers us no background on the two brothers except the bare fact  that Cain is a tiller of the soil who gives the fruits of his labor to God  whereas Abel is a shepherd who regularly sacrifices the firstborn of  his herds One of the brothers kills the other and the murderer is the  one who does not have the violenceoutlet of animal sacrifice at his  disposal This difference between sacrificial and nonsacrificial cults  determines in effect Gods judgement in favor of Abel To say that  God accedes to Abels sacrificial offerings but rejects the offerings of  Cain is simply another way of sayingfrom the viewpoint of the  divinitythat Cain is a murderer whereas his brother is not   A frequent motif in the Old Testament as well as in Greek myth is  that of brothers at odds with one another Their fatal penchant for  violence can only be diverted by the intervention of a third party the  sacrificial victim or victims Cains jealousy of his brother is only  another term for his one characteristic trait his lack of a sacrificial  outlet   According to Moslem tradition God delivered to Abraham the ram  previously sacrificed by Abel This ram was to take the place of Abra hams son Isaac having already saved one human life the same animal  would now save another What we have here is no mystical hocus    Sacrifice 5   pocus but an intuitive insight into the essential function of sacrifice  gleaned exclusively from the scant references in the Bible   xnother familiar biblical scene takes on new meaning in the light of  our theory of sacrificial substitution and it can serve in turn to illumi nate some aspects of the theory The scene is that in which Jacob  receives the blessing of his father Isaac   Isaac is an old man He senses the approach of death and summons  his eldest son Esau on whom he intends to bestow his final blessing  First however he instructs Esau to bring back some venison from the  hunt so as to make a savory meat This request is overheard by the  younger brother Jacob who hastens to report it to his mother Re bekah Rebekah takes two kids from the family flock slaughters them  and prepares the savory meat dish which Jacob in the guise of his  elder brother then presents to his father   Isaac is blind Nevertheless Jacob fears he will be recognized for he  is a smooth man while his brother Esau is a hairy man My  father peradventure will feel me and I shall seem to him as a deceiver  and I shall bring a curse upon me not a blessing Rebekah has the idea  of covering Jacobs hands and the back of his neck with the skins of  the slaughtered goats and when the old man runs his hands over his  younger son he is completely taken in by the imposture Jacob re ceives the blessing that Isaac had intended for Esau   The kids serve in two different ways to dupe the fatheror in  other terms to divert from the son the violence directed toward him  In order to receive his fathers blessing rather than his curse Jacob  must present to Isaac the freshly slaughtered kids made into a savory  meat Then the son must seek refuge literally in the skins of the  sacrificed animals The animals thus interpose themselves between fa ther and son They serve as a sort of insulation preventing the direct  contact that could lead only to violence   Two sorts of substitution are telescoped here that of one brother  for another and that of an animal for a man Only the first receives  explicit recognition in the text however this first one serves as the  screen upon which the shadow of the second is projected   Once we have focused attention on the sacrificial victim the object  originally singled out for violence fades from view Sacrificial substi tution implies a degree of misunderstanding Its vitality as an institu tion depends on its ability to conceal the displacement upon which the  rite is based It must never lose sight entirely however of the original  object or cease to be aware of the act of transference from that object  to the surrogate victim without that awareness no substitution can  take place and the sacrifice loses all efficacy The biblical passage dis    6 Violence and the Sacred   cussed above meets both requirements The narrative does not refer  directly to the strange deception underlying the sacrificial substitution  nor does it allow this deception to pass entirely unnoticed Rather it  mixes the act of substitution with another act of substitution permit ting us a fleeting sidelong glimpse of the process The narrative itself  then might be said to partake of a sacrificial quality it claims to reveal  one act of substitution while employing this first substitution to half conceal another There is reason to believe that the narrative touches  upon the mythic origins of the sacrificial system   The figure of Jacob has long been linked with the devious character  of sacrificial violence In Greek culture Odysseus plays a similar role  The story of Jacobs benediction can be compared to the episode of  the Cyclops in the Odyssey where a splendidly executed ruse enables  the hero to escape the clutches of a monster   Odysseus and his shipmates are shut up in the Cyclops cave Every  day the giant devours one of the crew the survivors finally manage to  blind their tormentor with a flaming stake Mad with pain and anger  the Cyclops bars the entrance of the cave to prevent the men from  escaping However he lets pass his flock of sheep which go out daily  to pasture In a gesture reminiscent of the blind Isaac the Cyclops runs  his hands over the back of each sheep as it leaves the cave to make sure  that it carries no passenger Odysseus however has outwitted his cap tor and he rides to freedom by clinging to the thick wool on the  underside of one of the rams   A comparison of the two scenes one from Genesis and the other  from the Odyssey lends credence to the theory of their sacrificial  origins In each case an animal intervenes at the crucial moment to  prevent violence from attaining its designated victim The two texts  are mutually revealing the Cyclops of the Odyssey underlines the  fearful menace that hangs over the hero and that remains obscure in  the Genesis story and the slaughter of the kids in Genesis along with  the offering of the savory meat clearly implies the sacrificial charac ter of the flock an aspect that might go unnoticed in the Odyssey    SACRIFICE HAS OFTEN BEEN DESCRIBED as an  act of mediation between a sacrificer and a deity Because the very  concept of a deity much less a deity who receives blood sacrifices has  little reality in this day and age the entire institution of sacrifice is  relegated by most modern theorists to the realm of the imagination  The approach of Hubert and Mauss leads to the judgement of Claude  LeviStrauss in La Pensee sauvage because sacrificial rites have no basis  in reality we have every reason to label them meaningless   The attempt to link sacrifice to a nonexistent deity brings to mind     Sacrifice 7   Paul Valerys description of poetry as a purely solipsistic activity prac ticed by the more able solely out of love for art while the less able  persist in the belief that they are actually communicating with some one   The two ancient narratives examined above make unmistakable ref erence to the act of sacrifice but neither makes so much as a passing  mention of a deity If a god had intervened in either incident its  significance would have been diminished rather than increased and the  reader would have been led to conclude in accordance with the beliefs  common to late antiquity and to the modern world that sacrifice has  no real function in society Divine intervention would have meant the  elimination of the pervasive aura of dread along with its firmly struc tured economy of violence We would have then been thrown back  upon a formalistic critical approach that would in no way further our  understanding   As we have seen the sacrificial process requires a certain degree of  misunderstanding The celebrants do not and must not comprehend  the true role of the sacrificial act The theological basis of the sacrifice  has a crucial role in fostering this misunderstanding It is the god who  supposedly demands the victims he alone in principle who savors the  smoke from the altars and requisitions the slaughtered flesh It is to  appease his anger that the killing goes on that the victims multiply  Interpreters who think they question the primacy of the divine suffi ciently by declaring the whole affair imaginary may well remain the  prisoners of the theology they have not really analyzed The problem  then becomes how can a real institution be constructed on a purely  illusory basis It is not to be wondered at if the outer shell finally gives  way bringing down with it even the most solid aspects of the institu tion   Instead of rejecting the theological basis outright qua abstraction  which is the same in effect as passively accepting it let us expose its  assumptions to a critical examination Let us try to uncover the societal  conflicts that the sacrificial act and its theological interpretations at  once dissimulate and appease We must break with the formalistic  tradition of Hubert and Mauss   The interpretation of sacrifice as an act of violence inflicted on a  surrogate victim has recently been advanced once again Godfrey  Lienhardt in Divinity and Experience and Victor Turner in a num ber of works especially The Drums of Affliction drawing from  fieldwork portray sacrifice as practiced among the Dinka and the  Ndernbu as a deliberate act of collective substitution performed at the  expense of the victim and absorbing all the internal tensions feuds and  rivalries pent up within the community     8 Violence and the Sacred   Sacrifice plays a very real role in these societies and the problem of  substitution concerns the entire community The victim is not a substi tute for some particularly endangered individual nor is it offered up to  some individual of particularly bloodthirsty temperament Rather it is  a substitute for all the members of the community offered up by the  members themselves The sacrifice serves to protect the entire com munity from its oiim violence it prompts the entire community to  choose victims outside itself The elements of dissension scattered  throughout the community are drawn to the person of the sacrificial  victim and eliminated at least temporarily by its sacrifice   If we turn our attention from the theological superstructure of the  actthat is from an interpretive version of the event that is often  accepted as the final statement on sacrificewe quickly perceive yet  another level of religious discourse in theory subordinated to the theo logical dimension but in reality quite independent of it This has to do  with the social function of the act an aspect far more accessible to the  modern mind   It is easy to ridicule a religion by concentrating on its more eccen tric rites rites such as the sacrifices performed to induce rain or bring  fine weather There is in fact no object or endeavor in whose name a  sacrifice cannot be made especially when the social basis of the act has  begun to blur Nevertheless there is a common denominator that de termines the efficacy of all sacrifices and that becomes increasingly  apparent as the institution grows in vigor This common denominator  is internal violenceall the dissensions rivalries jealousies and quar rels within the community that the sacrifices are designed to suppress  The purpose of the sacrifice is to restore harmony to the community  to reinforce the social fabric Everything else derives from that If  once we take this fundamental approach to sacrifice choosing the road  that violence opens before us we can see that there is no aspect of  human existence foreign to the subject not even material prosperity  When men no longer live in harmony with one another the sun still  shines and the rain falls to be sure but the fields are less well tended  the harvests less abundant   The classic literature of China explicitly acknowledges the propitia tory function of sacrificial rites Such practices pacify the country  and make the people settled    It is through the sacrifices that the  unity of the people is strengthened CHU YU II 2 The Book of  Rites affirms that sacrificial ceremonies music punishments and laws  have one and the same end to unite society and establish order6   In attempting to formulate the fundamental principles of

place we run the risk of appearing simplistic Such an effort  smacks strongly of psychologizing1 Gearly it would be inexact to  compare the sacrificial act to the spontaneous gesture of the man who  kicks his dog because he dares not kick his wife or boss However  there are Greek myths that are hardly more than colossal variants of  such gestures Such a one is the story of Ajax Furious at the leaders of  the Greek army who refused to award him Achilles weapons Ajax  slaughters the herd of sheep intended as provisions for the army In his  mad rage he mistakes these gentle creatures for the warriors on whom  he means to vent his rage The slaughtered animals belong to a species  traditionally utilized by the Greeks for sacrificial purposes but be cause the massacre takes place outside the ritual framework Ajax is  taken for a madman The myth is not strictly speaking about the  sacrificial process but it is certainly not irrelevant to it The institution  of sacrifice is based on effects analogous to those produced by Ajaxs  angerbut structured channeled and held in check by fixed laws   In the ritualistic societies most familiar to usthose of the Jews and  of the Greeks of the classical agethe sacrificial victims are almost  always animals However there are other societies in which human  victims are substituted for the individuals who are threatened by vio lence   Even in fifth century Greecethe Athens of the great tragedians  human sacrifice had not it seems completely disappeared The prac tice was perpetuated in the form of the pharmakos maintained by the  city at its own expense and slaughtered at the appointed festivals as  well as at a moment of civic disaster If examined closely for traces of  human sacrifice Greek tragedy offers some remarkable revelations It  is clear for example that the story of Medea parallels that of Ajax on  the sacrificial level although here we are dealing with human rather  than with animal sacrifice In Euripides Medea the principle of human  substitution of one victim for another appears in its most savage form  Frightened by the intensity of Medeas rage against her faithless hus band Jason the nurse begs the childrens tutor to keep his charges out  of their mothers way   I am sure her anger will not subside until it has found a victim Let us  pray that the victim is at least one of our enemies7   Because the object of her hatred is out of reach Medea substitutes her  own children It is difficult for us to see anything resembling a reli gious act in Medeas insane behavior Nonetheless infanticide has its   7 Here and throughout the book quotations from the Greek plays have been  translated by Patrick Gregory from the original Greek     10 Violence and the Sacred   place among ritualistic practices the practice is too well documented  in too many cultures including the Jewish and the ancient Greek for  us to exclude it from consideration here Medeas crime is to ritual  infanticide what the massacre of sheep in the Ajax is to animal sacri fice Medea prepares for the death of her children like a priest prepar ing for a sacrifice Before the fateful act she issues the traditional ritual  announcement all those whose presence might in any way hinder the  effectiveness of the ceremony are requested to remove themselves  from the premises   Medea like Ajax reminds us of a fundamental truth about violence  if left unappeased violence will accumulate until it overflows its con fines and floods the surrounding area The role of sacrifice is to stem  this rising tide of indiscriminate substitutions and redirect violence into  proper channels   Ajax has details that underline the close relationship between the  sacrificial substitution of animals and of humans Before he sets upon  the flock of sheep Ajax momentarily contemplates the sacrifice of his  own son The boys mother does not take this threat lightly she whisks  the child away   In a general study of sacrifice there is little reason to differentiate  between human and animal victims When the principle of the substi tution is physical resemblance between the vicarious victim and its  prototypes the mere fact that both victims are human beings seems to  suffice Thus it is hardly surprising that in some societies whole cate gories of human beings are systematically reserved for sacrificial pur poses in order to protect other categories   1 do not mean to minimize the gap that exists between the societies  that practice human sacrifice and those that do not However this gap  should not prevent us from perceiving what they have in common  Strictly speaking there is no essential difference between animal sacri fice and human sacrifice and in many cases one is substituted for the  other Our tendency to insist on differences that have little reality  when discussing the institution of sacrificeour reluctance for exam ple to equate animal with human sacrificeis undoubtedly a factor in  the extraordinary misunderstandings that still persist in that area of  human culture   This reluctance to consider all forms of sacrifice as a single phenom enon is nothing new Joseph de Maistre having defined the principle of  sacrificial substitution makes the bold and wholly unsubstantiated as sertion that this principle does not apply to human sacrifice One  cannot he insists kill a man to save a man Yet this assertion is repeat edly contradicted by Greek tragedy implicitly in a play like Medea  and explicitly elsewhere in Euripides     Sacrifice 11   In Euripides Electra Qvtemnestra explains that the sacrifice of her  daughter Iphigenia would have been justified if it had been performed  to save human lives The tragedian thus enlightens us by way of  Qytemnestra on the normal function of human sacrificethe func tion de Maistre had refused to acknowledge If says Qytemnestra  Agamemnon had permitted his daughter to die      in order to prevent the sack of the city to help his home to rescue  his children sacrificing one to save the others I could then have par doned him But for the sake of brazen Helen       Without ever expressly excluding the subject of human sacrifice  from their researchand indeed on what grounds could they do so  modern scholars notably Hubert and Mauss mention it but rarely in  their theoretical discussions On the other hand the scholars who do  concern themselves with human sacrifice tend to concentrate on it to  the exclusion of everything else dwelling at length on the sadistic or  barbarous aspects of the custom Here again one particular form of  sacrifice is isolated from the subject as a whole   This dividing of sacrifice into two categories human and animal has  itself a sacrificial character in a strictly ritualistic sense The division is  based in effect on a value judgement on the preconception that one  category of victimthe human beingis quite unsuitable for sacrifi cial purposes while another categorythe animalis eminently sac rificeable We encounter here a survival of the sacrificial mode of  thinking that perpetuates a misunderstanding about the institution as a  whole It is not a question of rejecting the value judgment on which  this misunderstanding is based but of putting it so to speak in paren theses of recognizing that as far as the institution is concerned such  judgments are purely arbitrary All reduction into categories whether  implicit or explicit must be avoided all victims animal or human must  be treated in the same fashion if we wish to apprehend the criteria by  which victims are selected if indeed such criteria exist and discover  if such a thing is possible a universal principle for their selection   We have remarked that all victims even the animal ones bear a  certain resemblance to the object they replace otherwise the violent  impulse would remain unsatisfied But this resemblance must not be  carried to the extreme of complete assimilation or it would lead to  disastrous confusion In the case of animal victims the difference is  always clear and no such confusion is possible Although they do their  best to empathize with their cattle the Nuers never quite manage to  mistake a man for a cowthe proof being that they always sacrifice  the latter never the former I am not lapsing into the trap of Levy     12 Violence and the Sacred   Bruhls primitive mentality I am not saying that primitive man is  less capable of making distinctions than we moderns   In order for a species or category of living creature human or  animal to appear suitable for sacrifice it must bear a sharp resemblance  to the human categories excluded from the ranks of the sacrificeable  while still maintaining a degree of difference that forbids all possible  confusion As I have said no mistake is possible in the case of animal  sacrifice But it is quite another case with human victims If we look at  the extremely wide spectrum of human victims sacrificed by various  societies the list seems heterogeneous to say the least It includes  prisoners of war slaves small children unmarried adolescents and the  handicapped it ranges from the very dregs of society such as the  Greek pharmakos to the king himself   Is it possible to detect a unifying factor in this disparate group We  notice at first glance beings who are either outside or on the fringes of  society prisoners of war slaves pharmakos In many primitive soci eties children who have not vet undergone the rites of initiation have  no proper place in the community their rights and duties are almost  nonexistent What we are dealing with therefore are exterior or mar ginal individuals incapable of establishing or sharing the social bonds  that link the rest of the inhabitants Their status as foreigners or ene mies their servile condition or simply their age prevents these future  victims from fully integrating themselves into the community   But what about the king Is he not at the very heart of the com munity Undoubtedlybut it is precisely his position at the center  that serves to isolate him from his fellow men to render him casteless  He escapes from society so to speak via the roof just as the phar makos escapes through the cellar The king has a son of foil however  in the person of his fool The fool shares his masters status as an  outsideran isolation whose literal truth is often of greater signifi cance than the easily reversible symbolic values often attributed to it  From every point of view the fool is eminently sacrificeable and the  king can use him to vent his own anger But it sometimes happens that  the king himself is sacrificed and that among certain African soci eties in a thoroughly regulated and highly ritualistic manner8   It is clearly legitimate to define the difference between sacrificeable  and nonsacrificeable individuals in terms of their degree of integration  but such a definition is not yet sufficient In many cultures women are  not considered fullfledged members of their society yet women are  never or rarely selected as sacrificial victims There may be a simple  explanation for this fact The married woman retains her ties with her    Cf Chapter 4 pp 10410     Sacrifice 13   parents clan even after she has become in some respects the property  of her husband and his family To kill her would be to run the risk of  one of the two groups interpreting her sacrifice as an act of murder  committing it to a reciprocal act of revenge The notion of vengeance  casts a new light on the matter All our sacrificial victims whether  chosen from one of the human categories enumerated above or a  fortiori from the animal realm are invariably distinguishable from the  nonsacrificeable beings by one essential characteristic between these  victims and the community a crucial social link is missing so they can  be exposed to violence without fear of reprisal Their death does not  automatically entail an act of vengeance   The considerable importance this freedom from reprisal has for the  sacrificial process makes us understand that sacrifice is primarily an act  of violence without risk of vengeance We also understand the paradox  not without its comic aspects on occasionof the frequent refer ences to vengeance in the course of sacrificial rites the veritable obses sion with vengeance when no chance of vengeance exists   For the act they were about to commit elaborate excuses were offered  they shuddered at the prospect of the sheeps death they wept over it as  though they were its parents Before the blow was struck they implored  the beasts forgiveness They then addressed themselves to the species to  which the beast belonged as if addressing a large family clan beseeching  it not to seek vengeance for the act that was about to be inflicted on one  of its members In the same vein the actual murderer was punished in  some manner either beaten or sent into exile9   It is the entire species considered as a large family clan that the  sacrificers beseech not to seek vengeance By incorporating the ele ment of reprisal into the ceremony the participants are hinting  broadly at the true function of the rite the kind of action it was  designed to circumvent and the criteria that determined the choice of  victim The desire to commit an act of violence on those near us  cannot be suppressed without a conflict we must divert that impulse  therefore toward the sacrificial victim the creature we can strike  down without fear of reprisal since he lacks a champion   Like everything that touches on the essential nature of the sacrificial  act the true distinction between the sacrificeable and the nonsacrifice able is never clearly articulated Oddities and inexplicable anomalies  confuse the picture For instance some animal species will be formally  excluded from sacrifice but the exclusion of members of the com munity is never mentioned In constantly drawing attention to the  truly maniacal aspects of sacrifice modern theorists only serve to per  9 Hubert and Mauss Sacrifice p 33     14 Violence and the Sacred   petuate an old misunderstanding in new terms Men can dispose of  their violence more efficiently if they regard the process not as some thing emanating from within themselves but as a necessity imposed  from without a divine decree whose least infraction calls down ter rible punishment When they banish sacrificial practices from the  real everyday world modern theorists continue to misrepresent the  violence of sacrifice   The function of sacrifice is to quell violence within the community  and to prevent conflicts from erupting Yet societies like our own  which do not strictly speaking practice sacrificial rites seem to get  along without them Violence undoubtedly exists within our society  but not to such an extent that the society itself is threatened with  extinction The simple fact that sacrificial practices and other rites as  well can disappear without catastrophic results should in part explain  the failure of ethnology and theology to come to grips with these  cultural phenomena and explain as well our modern reluctance to  attribute a real function to them After all it is hard to maintain that  institutions for which as it seems we have no need are actually indis pensable   It may be that a basic difference exists between a society like ours  and societies imbued with religiona difference that is partially hidden  from us by rites particularly by rites of sacrifice that play a com pensatory role This difference would help explain why the actual  function of sacrifice still eludes us   When internal strife previously sublimated by means of sacrificial  practices rises to the surface it manifests itself in interfamily vendettas  or blood feuds This kind of violence is virtually nonexistent in our  own culture And perhaps it is here that we should look for the fun damental difference between primitive societies and our own we  should examine the specific ailments to which we are immune and  which sacrifice manages to control if not to eliminate   Why does the spirit of revenge wherever it breaks out constitute  such an intolerable menace Perhaps because the only satisfactory re venge for spilt blood is spilling the blood of the killer and in the blood  feud there is no clear distinction between the act for which the killer is  being punished and the punishment istelf Vengeance professes to be  an act of reprisal and every reprisal calls for another reprisal The  crime to which the act of vengeance addresses itself is almost never an  unprecedented offense in almost every case it has been committed in  revenge for some prior crime   Vengeance then is an interminable infinitely repetitive process  Every time it turns up in some part of the community it threatens to     Sacrifice IS   involve the whole social body There is the risk that the act of ven geance will initiate a chain reaction whose consequences will quickly  prove fatal to any society of modest size The multiplication of re prisals instantaneously puts the very existence of a society in jeopardy  and that is why it is universally proscribed   Curiously enough it is in the very communities where the proscrip tion is most strictly enforced that vengeance seems to hold sway Even  when it remains in the background its role in the community un acknowledged the specter of vengeance plays an important role in  shaping the relationships among individuals That is not to say that the  prohibition against acts of vengeance is taken lightly Precisely because  murder inspires horror and because men must be forcibly restrained  from murder vengeance is inflicted on all those who commit it The  obligation never to shed blood cannot be distinguished from the obli gation to exact vengeance on those who shed it If men wish to prevent  an interminable outbreak of vengeance just as today we wish to pre vent nuclear war it is not enough to convince their fellows that  violence is detestablefor it is precisely because they detest violence  that men make a duty of vengeance   In a world still haunted by the specter of vengeance it is difficult to  theorize about vengeance without resorting to equivocations or para doxes In Greek tragedy for instance there is notand cannot be  any consistent stand on the subject To attempt to extract a coherent  theory of vengeance from the drama is to miss the essence of tragedy  For in tragedy each character passionately embraces or rejects ven geance depending on the position he occupies at any given moment in  the scheme of the drama   Vengeance is a vicious circle whose effect on primitive societies can  only be surmised For us the circle has been broken We owe our good  fortune to one of our social institutions above all our judicial system  which serves to deflect the menace of vengeance The system does not  suppress vengeance rather it effectively limits it to a single act of  reprisal enacted by a sovereign authority specializing in this particular  function The decisions of the judiciary are invariably presented as the  final word on vengeance   Vocabulary is perhaps more revealing here than judicial theories  Once the concept of interminable revenge has been formally rejected  it is referred to as private vengeance The term implies the existence of  a public vengeance a counterpart never made explicit By definition  primitive societies have only private vengeance Thus public ven geance is the exclusive property of wellpoliced societies and our so ciety calls it the judicial system      6 Violence and the Sacred   Our penal system operates according to principles of justice that are  in no real conflict with the concept of revenge The same principle is  at work in all systems of violent retribution Either the principle is  just and justice is therefore inherent in the idea of vengeance or there  is no justice to be found anywhere He who exacts his own vengeance  is said to take the law into his own hands There is no difference of  principle between private and public vengeance but on the social level  the difference is enormous Under the pyblic system an act of ven geance is no longer avenged the process is terminated the danger of  escalation averted   The absence of a judicial system in primitive societies has been con firmed by ethnologists Malinowski concludes that the criminal  aspect of law in savage communities is perhaps even vaguer than the  civil one the idea of justice in our sense is hardly applicable and the  means of restoring a disturbed tribal equilibrium are slow and cum bersome10   RadcliffeBrowns conclusions are identical and summon up as such  conclusions must the specter of perpetual vengeance Thus though  the Andaman Islanders had a welldeveloped social conscience that is  a system of moral notions as to what is right and wrong there was no  such thing as punishment of a crime by the society If one person  injured another it was left to the injured one to seek vengeance if he  wished and if he dared There were probably always some who would  side with the criminal their attachment to him overcoming their dis approval of his actions11   The anthropologist Robert Lowie speaks of the administering of  justice in reference to primitive societies He distinguishes two types  of societies those that possess a central authority and those that do  not Among the latter it is the parental group he declares that exer cises the judicial power and this group confronts the other group in  the same way that a sovereign state confronts the outside world There  can be no true administering of justice no judicial system without a  superior tribunal capable of arbitrating between even the most power ful groups Only that superior tribunal can remove the possibility of  blood feud or perpetual vendetta Lowie himself recognizes that this  condition is not always met From the supreme law of group solidar ity it follows that when an individual has injured a member of another  group his own group shield him while the opposing group support the  injured mans claims for compensation or revenge Thence there may  develop bloodfeuds and civil wars    The Chukchi generally make   10 Bronislaw Malinowski Crime and Custom in Savage Society Totowa NJ

12   To speak here of the administering of justice is to abuse the mean ing of the words The desire to find in primitive societies virtues equal  or superior to our own as regards the control of violence must not lead  us to minimize the differences Lowies terminology simply perpetuates  a widely accepted way of thinking by which the right to vengeance  takes the place of a judicial system wherever such a system is lacking  This theory which seems securely anchored to common sense is in  fact erroneous and gives rise to an infinite number of errors Such  thinking reflects the ignorance of a societyour ownthat has been  the beneficiary of a judicial system for so many years that it is no  longer conscious of the systems real achievements   If vengeance is an unending process it can hardly be invoked to  restrain the violent impulses of society In fact it is vengeance itself  that must be restrained Lowie bears witness to the truth of this propo sition every time he gives an example of the administering of justice  even in those societies that according to him possess a central author ity It is not the lack of any abstract principle of justice that is  important but the fact that the socalled legal reprisals are always in  the hands of the victims themselves and those near to them As long as  there exists no sovereign and independent body capable of taking the  place of the injured party and taking upon itself the responsibility for  revenge the danger of interminable escalation remains Efforts to  modify the punishment or to hold vengeance in check can only result  in a situation that is precarious at best Such efforts ultimately require a  spirit of conciliation that may indeed be present but may equally well  be lacking As I have said it is inexact to speak of the administering of  justice even in connection with such institutional concepts as an eye  for an eye or the various forms of trial by combat In such cases it  seems wise to adhere to iMalinowskis conclusion The means of re storing a disturbed tribal equilibrium are slow and cumbersome     We have not found any arrangement or usage which could be classed  as a form of administration of justice according to a code and by  fixed methods13   If primitive societies have no tried and true remedies for dealing  with an outbreak of violence no certain cure once the social equi librium has been upset we can assume that preventive measures will  play an essential role Here again I return to the concept of sacrifice as  I earlier defined it an instrument of prevention in the struggle against  violence   12 Robert Lowie Primitive Society New York 1970 p 400  13 Malinowski Crime and Custom in Savage Society pp 94 98     18 Violence and the Sacred   In a universe where the slightest dispute can lead to disasterjust as  a slight cut can prove fatal to a hemophiliacthe rites of sacrifice serve  to polarize the communitys aggressive impulses and redirect them  toward victims that may be actual or figurative animate or inanimate  but that are always incapable of propagating further vengeance The  sacrificial process furnishes an outlet for those violent impulses that  cannot be mastered by selfrestraint a partial outlet to be sure but  always renewable and one whose efficacy has been attested by an  impressive number of reliable witnesses The sacrificial process pre vents the spread of violence by keeping vengeance in check   In societies that practice sacrifice there is no critical situation to  which the rites are not applicable but there are certain crises that seem  to be particularly amenable to sacrificial mediation In these crises the  social fabric of the community is threatened dissension and discord are  rife The more critical the situation the more precious the sacrificial  victim must be   It is significant that sacrifice has languished in societies with a firmly  established judicial systemancient Greece and Rome for example In  such societies the essential purpose of sacrifice has disappeared It may  still be practiced for a while but in diminished and debilitated form  And it is precisely under such circumstances that sacrifice usually  comes to our notice and our doubts as to the real function of  religious institutions are only reinforced   Our original proposition stands ritual in general and sacrificial rites  in particular assume essential roles in societies that lack a firm judicial  system It must not be assumed however that sacrifice simply re places a judicial system One can scarcely speak of replacing some thing that never existed to begin with Then too a judicial system is  ultimately irreplaceable short of a unanimous and entirely voluntary  renunciation of all violent actions   When we minimize the dangers implicit in vengeance we risk losing  sight of the true function of sacrifice Because revenge is rarely en countered in our society we seldom have occasion to consider how  societies lacking a judicial system of punishment manage to hold it in  check Our ignorance engages us in a false line of thought that is  seldom if ever challenged Certainly we have no need of religion to  help us solve a problem runaway vengeance whose very existence  eludes us And because we have no need for it religion itself appears  senseless The efficiency of our judicial solution conceals the problem  and the elimination of the problem conceals from us the role played by  religion   The air of mystery that primitive societies acquire for us is undoubt edly due in large part to this misunderstanding It is undoubtedly     Sacrifice 19   responsible for our extreme views of these societies our insistence on  portraying them alternately as vastly superior or flagrantly inferior to  our own One factor alone might well be responsible for our oscillation  between extremes our radical evaluations the absence in such societies  of a judicial system No one can assess with certainty the amount of  violence present in another individual much less in another society  We can be sure however that in a society lacking a judicial system the  violence will not appear in the same places or take the same forms as in  our own We generally limit our area of inquiry to the most con spicuous and accessible aspects of these societies Thus it is not un natural that they should seem to us either horribly barbarous or bliss fully Utopian   In primitive societies the risk of unleashed violence is so great and  the cure so problematic that the emphasis naturally falls on prevention  The preventive measures naturally fall within the domain of religion  where they can on occasion assume a violent character Violence and  the sacred are inseparable But the covert appropriation by sacrifice of  certain properties of violenceparticularly the ability of violence to  move from one object to anotheris hidden from sight by the awe some machinery of ritual   Primitive societies are not given over to violence Nor are they  necessarily less violent or less hypocritical than our own society Of  course to be truly comprehensive we ought to take into consideration  all forms of violence more or less ritualized that divert a menace from  nearby objects to more distant objects We ought for instance to  consider war War is clearly not restricted to one particular type of  society Yet the multiplication of new weapons and techniques does  not constitute a fundamental difference between primitive and modern  warfare On the other hand if we compare societies that adhere to a  judicial system with societies that practise sacrificial rites the differ ence between the two is such that we can indeed consider the absence  or presence of these institutions as a basis for distinguishing primitive  societies from civilized11 ones These are the institutions we must  scrutinize in order to arrive not at some sort of value judgement but  at an objective knowledge of the respective societies to which they  belong   In primitive societies the exercise of preventive measures is not con fined exclusively to the domain of religion The way in which these  measures are made manifest in normal social intercourse made a lasting  impression on the minds and imaginations of the first European ob servers and established a prototype of primitive psychology and  behavior which if not universally applicable is still not wholly il lusory     20 Violence and the Sacred   When the least false step can have dire consequences human rela tionships may well be marked by a prudence that seems to us excessive  and accompanied by precautions that appear incomprehensible It is in  this sense that we must understand the lengthy palavers that precede  any undertaking not sanctified by custom in this sense that we must  understand primitive mans reluctance to engage in nonritualized  games or contests In a society where every action or gesture may have  irreparable consequences it is not surprising that the members should  display a noble gravity of bearing beside which our own demeanor  appears ridiculous The commercial administrative or ideological con cerns that make such overwhelming demands on our time and atten tion seem utterly frivolous in comparison to primitive mans primary  concerns   Primitive societies do not have built into their structure an au tomatic brake against violence but we do in the form of powerful  institutions whose grip grows progressively tighter as their role grows  progressively less apparent The constant presence of a restraining  force allows modern man safely to transgress the limits imposed on  primitive peoples without even being aware of the fact In policed  societies the relationships between individuals including total stran gers is characterized by an extraordinary air of informality flexibility  and even audacity   Religion invariably strives to subdue violence to keep it from run ning wild Paradoxically the religious and moral authorities in a  community attempt to instill nonviolence as an active force into daily  life and as a mediating force into ritual life through the application of  violence Sacrificial rites serve to connect the moral and religious as pects of daily life but only by means of a lengthy and hazardous  detour Moreover it must be kept in mind that the efficacy of the rites  depends on their being performed in the spirit of pietas which marks  all aspects of religious life We are beginning to understand why the  sacrificial act appears as both sinful and saintly an illegal as well as a  legitimate exercise of violence However we are still far from a full  understanding of the act itself   Primitive religion tames trains arms and directs violent impulses as  a defensive force against those forms of violence that society regards as  inadmissible It postulates a strange mixture of violence and nonvio lence The same can perhaps be said of our own judicial system of  control   There may be a certain connection between all the various methods  employed by man since the beginning of time to avoid being caught up  in an interminable round of revenge They can be grouped into three  general categories 1 preventive measures in which sacrificial rites     Sacrifice 21   divert the spirit of revenge into other channels 2 the harnessing or  hobbling of vengeance by means of compensatory measures trials by  combat etc whose curative effects remain precarious 3 the estab lishment of a judicial systemthe most efficient of all curative proce dures   We have listed the methods in ascending order of effectiveness The  evolution from preventive to curative procedures is reflected in the  course of history or at any rate in the course of the history of the  Western world The initial curative procedures mark an intermediary  stage between a purely religious orientation and the recognition of a  judicial systems superior efficiency These methods are inherently  ritualistic in character and are often associated with sacrificial prac tices   The curative procedures employed by primitive societies appear  rudimentary to us We tend to regard them as fumbling efforts to  improvise a judicial system Certainly their pragmatic aspects are  clearly visible oriented as they are not toward the guilty parties but  toward the victimssince it is the latter who pose the most immediate  threat The injured parties must be accorded a careful measure of  satisfaction just enough to appease their own desire for revenge but  not so much as to awaken the desire elsewhere It is not a question of  codifying good and evil or of inspiring respect for some abstract con cept of justice rather it is a question of securing the safety of the  group by checking the impulse for revenge The preferred method  involves a reconciliation between parties based on some sort of mutual  compensation If reconciliation is impossible however an armed en counter can be arranged in such a manner that the violence is wholly  selfcontained This encounter can take place within an enclosed space  and can involve prescribed regulations and specifically designated  combatants Its purpose is to cut violence short   To be sure all these curative measures are steps in the direction of a  legal system But the evolution if indeed evolution is the proper term  is not continuous The break comes at the moment when the interven tion of an independent legal authority becomes constraining Only  then are men freed from the terrible obligations of vengeance Retri bution in its judicial guise loses its terrible urgency Its meaning re mains the same but this meaning becomes increasingly indistinct or  even fades from view In fact the system functions best when every one concerned is least aware that it involves retribution The svstem  canand as soon as it can it willreorganize itself around the accused  and the concept of guilt In fact retribution still holds sway but  forged into a principle of abstract justice that all men arc obliged to  uphold and respect     22 Violence and the Sacred   We have seen that the curative measures ostensibly designed to  temper the impulse toward vengeance become increasingly mysterious  in their workings as they progress in efficiency As the focal point of  the system shifts away from religion and the preventive approach is  translated into judicial retribution the aura of misunderstanding that  has always formed a protective veil around the institution of sacrifice  shifts as well and becomes associated in turn with the machinery of  the law   As soon as the judicial system gains supremacy its machinery disap pears from sight Like sacrifice it concealseven as it also revealsits  resemblance to vengeance differing only in that it is not selfperpetu ating and its decisions discourage reprisals In the case of sacrifice the  designated victim does not become the object of vengeance because he  is a replacement is not the right victim In the judicial system the  violence does indeed fall on the right victim but it falls with such  force such resounding authority that no retort is possible   It can be argued that the function of the judicial system is not really  concealed and we can hardly be unaware that the judicial process is  more concerned with the general security of the community than with  any abstract notion of justice Nonetheless we believe that the system  is founded on a unique principle of justice unknown to primitive soci eties The scholarly literature on the subject seems to bear out this  belief It has long been assumed that a decisive difference between  primitive and civilized man is the formers general inability to identify  the guilty party and to adhere to the principle of guilt Such an as sumption only confuses the issue If primitive man insists on averting  his attention from the wrongdoer with an obstinacy that strikes us as  either idiotic or perverse it is because he wishes above all to avoid  fueling the fires of vengeance   If our own system seems more rational it is because it conforms  more strictly to the principle of vengeance Its insistence on the pun ishment of the guilty party underlines this fact Instead of following  the example of religion and attempting to forestall acts of revenge to  mitigate or sabotage its effects or to redirect them to secondary ob jects our judicial system rationalizes revenge and succeeds in limiting  and isolating its effects in accordance with social demands The system  treats the disease without fear of contagion and provides a highly  effective technique for the cure and as a secondary effect the preven tion of violence   This rationalistic approach to vengeance might seem to stem from a  peculiarly intimate relationship between the community and the judi cial system In fact it is the result not of any familiar interchange  between the two but of the recognition of the sovereignty and inde    Sacrifice 25   pendence of the judiciary whose decisions no group not even the  collectivity as a body can challenge At least that is the principle  The judicial authority is beholden to no one It is thus at the disposal  of everyone and it is universally respected The judicial system never  hesitates to confront violence head on because it possesses a monopoly  on the means of revenge Thanks to this monopoly the system gener ally succeeds in stifling the impulse to vengeance rather than spreading  or aggravating it as a similar intervention on the part of the aggrieved  party would invariably do   In the final analysis then the judicial system and the institution of  sacrifice share the same function but the judicial system is infinitely  more effective However it can only exist in conjunction with a firmly  established political power And like all modern technological ad vances it is a twoedged sword which can be used to oppress as well as  to liberate Certainly that is the way it is seen by primitive cultures  whose view on the matter is indubitably more objective than our own   If the function of the system has now become apparent that is  because it no longer enjoys the obscurity it needs to operate effec tively A clear view of the inner workings indicates a crisis in the  system it is a sign of disintegration No matter how sturdy it may  seem the apparatus that serves to hide the true nature of legal and  illegal violence from view eventually wears thin The underlying truth  breaks through and we find ourselves face to face with the specter of  reciprocal reprisal This is not a purely theoretical concept belonging  to the intellectual and scholarly realm but a sinister reality a vicious  circle we thought we had escaped but one we find has tightened itself  all unsuspected around us   The procedures that keep mens violence in bounds have one thing  in common they are no strangers to the ways of violence There is  reason to believe that they are all rooted in religion As we have seen  the various forms of prevention go hand in hand with religious prac tices The curative procedures are also imbued with religious concepts  both the rudimentary sacrificial rites and the more advanced judicial  forms Religion in its broadest sense then must be another term for  that obscurity that surrounds mans efforts to defend himself by cura tive or preventative means against his own violence It is that enigmatic  quality that pervades the judicial system when that system replaces  sacrifice This obscurity coincides with the transcendental effective ness of a violence that is holy legal and legitimate successfully op posed to a violence that is unjust illegal and illegitimate   In the same way that sacrificial victims must in principle meet the  approval of the divinity before being offered as a sacrifice the judicial  system appeals to a theology as a guarantee of justice Even when this     24 Violence and the Sacred   theology disappears as has happened in our culture the transcendental  quality of the system remains intact Centuries can pass before men  realize that there is no real difference between their principle of justice  and the concept of revenge   Only the transcendental quality of the system acknowledged by all  can assure the prevention or cure of violence This is the case no  matter what the consecrating institution may be Only by opting for a  sanctified legitimate form of violence and preventing it from becom ing an object of disputes and recriminations can the system save itself  from the vicious circle of revenge   A unique generative force exists that we can only qualify as religious  in a sense deeper than the theological one It remains concealed and  draws its strength from this concealment even as its selfcreated shel ter begins to crumble The acknowledgment of such a force allows us  to assess our modern ignoranceignorance in regard to violence as  well as religion Religion shelters us from violence just as violence  seeks shelter in religion If we fail to understand certain religious prac tices it is not because we are outside their sphere of influence but  because we are still to a very real extent enclosed within them The  solemn debates on the death of God and of man are perhaps beside the  point They remain theological at bottom and by extension sacrificial  that is they draw a veil over the subject of vengeance which threatens  to become quite real once again in the form not of a philosophical  debate but of unlimited violence in a world with no absolute values  As soon as the essential quality of transcendencereligious humanis tic or whateveris lost there are no longer any terms by which to  define the legitimate form of violence and to recognize it among the  multitude of illicit forms The definition of legitimate and illegitimate  forms then becomes a matter of mere opinion with each man free to  reach his own decision In other words the question is thrown to the  winds Henceforth there are as many legitimate forms of violence as  there are men to implement them legitimacy as a principle no longer  exists Only the introduction of some transcendental quality that will  persuade men of the fundamental difference between sacrifice and re venge between a judicial system and vengeance can succeed in by passing violence   All this explains why our penetration and demystification of the  system necessarily coincides with the disintegration of that system  The act of demystification retains a sacrificial quality and remains  essentially religious in character for at least as long as it fails to come to  a conclusionas long that is as the process purports to be nonviolent  or less violent than the system itself In fact demystification leads to  constantly increasing violence a violence perhaps less hypocritical     Sacrifice 25   than the violence it seeks to expose but more energetic more virulent  and the harbinger of something far worsea violence that knows no  bounds   While acknowledging the differences both functional and mythical  between vengeance sacrifice and legal punishment it is important to  recognize their fundamental identity Precisely because these three in stitutions are essentially the same they tend to adopt the same types of  violent response in times of crisis Seen in the abstract such an asser tion may seem hyperbolic or simply unbelievable It can only be ap preciated by means of concrete examples Only then will the utility of  the comparison become apparent customs and institutions that have  remained incomprehensible unclassifiable and aberrant heretofore  make sense when seen in the light of this identity   Robert Lowie discussing collective reactions to an act of violence  brings out a fact well worth noting here The Chukchi generally  make peace after the first act of retribution    While the Ifugao tend  to protect a kinsman under almost all circumstances the Chukchi often  avert a feud by killing a member of the family14   Whether it be through sacrificial killing or legal punishment the  problem is to forestall a series of reprisals As the above quotation  shows Lowie is well aware of this aspect In killing one of their own  the Chukchi abort the issue by offering a victim to their potential  enemies they enjoin them not to seek vengeance not to commit an act  that would constitute a fresh affront and oblige the other side to seek  further retribution This expiatory procedure brings to mind the sacri ficial process the fact that the victim is someone other than the guilty  party drives the resemblance home   The Chukchi practice cannot however be classified as sacrificial A  properly conducted ritual killing is never openly linked to another  bloodletting of irregular character It never allows itself to pass as a  deliberate act of retribution Because this link is consistently missing  the meaning of the sacrificial process has always eluded us and the  relationship between sacrifice and violence has remained obscure Now  the meaning is made clear and in a manner too spectacular for the act  to be mistaken for mere ritual   Should one then classify this custom among legal punishments Can  one properly refer to it as an execution of justice Probably not  after all the victim of the second murder was in no way responsible  for the first To be sure Lowie invokes the concept of collective  responsibility but this is not a satisfactory explanation Collective  responsibility never specifically excludes the true culprit and that is   14 Lowie Primitive Society p 400     26 Violence and the Sacred   precisely what is being done here Even if this exclusion is not clearly  spelled out there is sufficient evidence for us to assume that in many  instances the true culprit is systematically spared As a cultural atti tude this certainly demands attention   To refer in this context to the socalled primitive mentality to some  possible confusion between the individual and the group is to hedge  the issue If the Chukchi choose to spare the culprit it is not because  they cannot distinguish where the guilt lies On the contrary they  perceive it with the utmost clarity It is precisely because they see that  the guilty party is guilty that they choose to spare him The Chukchi  believe that they have good reasons to act as they do and it is these  reasons we must now examine   To make a victim out of the guilty party is to play vengeances role  to submit to the demands of violence By killing not the murderer  himself but someone close to him an act of perfect reciprocity is  avoided and the necessity for revenge bypassed If the countervio lence were inflicted on the aggressor himself it would by this very act  participate in and become indistinguishable from the original act of  violence In short it would become an act of pure vengeance requir ing yet another act of vengeance and transforming itself into the very  thing it was designed to prevent   Only violence can put an end to violence and that is why violence is  selfpropagating Everyone wants to strike the last blow and reprisal  can thus follow reprisal without any true conclusion ever being  reached   In excluding the actual guilty party from reprisals the Chukchi hope  to avoid the vicious cycle of revenge They try to cover their tracks  but not entirely for they do not want to deprive their act of its  primordial meaning as a response to an initial killing as the payment of  a debt contracted by one of their number To quell the passions  aroused by this crime an act is required that bears some resemblance to  the vengeance sought by the plaintiffs but that does not quite qualify  as an act of revenge The act resembles both a legal punishment and a  sacrifice and yet it cannot be assimilated to either The act described  here resembles a legal punishment in that it constitutes an act of repa ration a violent retribution and the Chukchi show no hesitation in  imposing on themselves the same loss they have inflicted on others  Their action resembles a sacrifice in that the victim of the second  murder is not responsible for the first   So flagrant a disregard of the principle of guilt strikes us as absurd  We hold that principle in such high esteem that any deviation from it  appears to us an aberration of the intellect or malfunction of the senses  Yet our line of reasoning is rejected by the primitives because it     Sacrifice 21   involves too strict an application of the doctrine of vengeance and is  thus fraught with peril   When we require a direct link between guilt and punishment we  believe that we adhere to a fundamental truth that has somehow eluded  the primitive mind In fact we are ignoring a problem that poses a  very real threat to all primitive societies escalating revenge unleashed  violencea problem the seeming extravagances of their customs and  the violence of their religious practices are specifically designed to  meet   In Greek culture in particular physical contact with the anathema is  avoided Behind this peculiar prohibition lurks a fear perhaps analogous  to the one that inspires the Chukchi custom To do violence to a  violent person is to be contaminated by his violence It is best there fore to arrange matters so that nobody except perhaps the culprit  himself is directly responsible for his death so that nobody is obliged  to raise a finger against him He may be abandoned without provisions  in midocean or stranded on top of a mountain or forced to hurl  himself from a cliff The custom of exposure as a means of getting rid  of malformed children seems to find its origin in this same fear   All such customs may appear to us unreasonable and absurd In fact  they adhere to a coherent logic All of them concern themselves with  formulating and practicing a form of violence incapable of serving as a  connecting link between the violent act that preceded and the one that  must follow The aim is to achieve a radically new type of violence  truly decisive and selfcontained a form of violence that will put an  end once and for all to violence itself   Primitive peoples try to break the symmetry of reprisal by address ing themselves directly to the question of form Unlike us they per ceive recurrent patterns and they attempt to halt this recurrence by  introducing something different into the picture Modern man has long  since lost his fear of reciprocal violence which after all provides our  judicial system with its structure Because the overwhelming authority  of the judiciary prevents its sentence from becoming the first step in  an endless series of reprisals we can no longer appreciate primitive  mans deepseated fear of pure unadulterated vengeance The Chuk chis behavior or the Greeks cautious treatment of the anathema  strike us as puzzling   Of course the Chukchi solution is not to be confused with retalia tory vengeance ritual sacrifice or legal punishment And yet it is  reminiscent of all these institutions Their solution seems to occur at  the point where all three intersect Unless the modern mind can cope  with the fact that the three are indeed capable of intersecting it is not  likely to shed much light on the questions that concern us here     28 Violence and the Sacred   4 THE CHUKCHI SOLUTION is fraught with psycho logical implications all of rather limited interest For example it can be  said that in choosing to kill someone close to the culprit rather than the  culprit himself the Chukchi are trying to be conciliatory without risk ing a loss of face That is indeed possible but there are many other  possibilities as well It is easy to lose ones way in a maze of psycholog ical speculation The religious structure clearly transcends all psycho logical1  interpretations it neither requires nor contradicts them   The essential religious concern here is ritual impurity And the cause  of ritual impurity is violence In many cases this fact seems self evident   Two men come to blows blood is spilt both men are thus rendered  impure Their impurity is contagious and anyone who remains in their  presence risks becoming a party to their quarrel The only sure way to  avoid contagion is to flee the scene of violence There is no question  here of duty or morality Contamination is a terrible thing and only  those who are already contaminated would wilfully expose themselves  to it   If even an accidental contact with a contaminated being can  spread the impurity it goes without saying that a violent and hostile  encounter will guarantee infection Therefore the Chukchi reason  whenever violence is inevitable it is best that the victim be pure  untainted by any involvement in the dispute As we can see these  notions of impurity and contagion play an active role in social relations  and are firmly rooted in reality It is precisely this basis in reality that  scholars have long denied Modern observersparticularly Frazers  contemporaries and discipleswere totally blind to the reality that lay  behind these ideas because it was not their reality and because primi tive religion succeeded in camouflaging its social functionConcepts  such as impurity and contagion because they translate human relations  into material terms provide a sort of camouflage The peril that over shadows all human relations and that stems from these relations is  presented either in a purely material or in a wholly otherworldly guise  The notion of ritual impurity can degenerate until it is nothing more  than a terrorstricken belief in the malevolent results of physical con tact Violence has been transformed into a sort of seminal fluid that  impregnates objects on contact and whose diffusion like electricity or  Balzacian magnetism is determined by physical laws Far from dis sipating the ignorance that surrounds these concepts modern thinking  only reinforces the confusion By denying religion any basis in reality  by viewing it as a sort of bedtime story for children we collaborate  with violence in its game of deception     Sacrifice 29   In many religious communitiesamong the ancient Greeks for in stancewhen a man has hanged himself his body becomes impure So  too does the rope from which he dangles the tree to which the rope is  attached and the field where the tree stands The taint of impurity  diminishes however as one draws away from the body It is as if the  scene of a violent act and the objects with which the violence has been  committed send out emanations that penetrate everything in the im mediate area growing gradually weaker through time and space   When a town has undergone a terrible bloodletting and emissaries  from that town are sent to another community they are considered  impure Every effort is made to avoid touching them talking to them  remaining in their presence any longer than necessary After their  departure rites of purification are undertaken sacrifices offered lustral  water sprinkled about   While Frazer and his disciples tend to view this fear of infection by  the impure as a prime example of the irrational and supersti tious element of religious thought other observers regard it as an  anticipation of sound scientific principles They point out the striking  resemblance between the precautions that modern medicine takes  against bacterial infection and the ritualistic avoidance of pollution   In some societies contagious diseasessmallpox for instancehave  their own particular gods During his illness the patient is dedicated to  the god that is he is isolated from the community and put under the  supervision of an initiate or priest of the god someone who has  contracted the illness and survived it This man now partakes of the  gods power he is immune to the effects of the divine violence   It is easy to see why some observers have concluded that these  impurity rituals reveal some sort of vague intuitive knowledge of  microbiology that the rituals in short are grounded in fact Against  this view it is argued that the procedures that are supposed to protect  the believers from ritual impurity often disregard or even flout the  principles of modern hygiene This argument is not wholly satisfac tory however for it fails to take into account the possible parallels  between ritualistic precautions and the first tentative measures taken in  the early days of public hygienein the nineteenth century for  example   The theory that regards religious terrors or taboos as a sort of proto science has hit on something of real interest but too indefinite and  limited to be of much use in our investigation Such a theory can only  arise in a culture that regards sickness as the sole fatal influence the  sole enemy man has to conquer Clearly medical considerations are not  excluded from the primitive concept of contagion and the prevention  of epidemics plays a definite role in impurity rites But these factors     SO Violence and the Sacred   play only a minor role in primitive culture They arouse our interest  precisely because they offer the sole instance in which the modern  scientific notion of contagion which is exclusively pathological coin cides with the primitive concept which is far broader in scope   The aspects of religion in which contagion seems to have some  reality for us are hard to distinguish from those in which it ceases to  have any reality That is not to say that primitive religion is afflicted  with the sort of confusion that Frazer or LevyBruhl attributed to it  The assimilation of contagious diseases and all forms of violencethe  latter also regarded as contagious in natureis based on a number of  complementary inferences that combine to form a strikingly coherent  picture   A primitive society a society that lacks a legal system is exposed to  the sudden escalation of violence Such a society is compelled to adopt  attitudes we may well find incomprehensible Our incomprehension  seems to stem from two main factors In the first place we know  absolutely nothing about the contagion of violence not even whether  it actually exists In the second place the primitive people themselves  recognize this violence only in an almost entirely dehumanized form  that is under the deceptive guise of the sacred   Considered all together the ritual precautions against violence are  firmly rooted in reality absurd though some of them may appear to  our own eyes If the sacrificial catharsis actually succeeds in preventing  the unlimited propagation of violence a sort of infection is in fact  being checked f   From the outset of this study after all I have regarded violence as  something eminently communicable The tendency of violence to hurl  itself on a surrogate if deprived of its original object can surely be  described as a contaminating process Violence too long held in check  will overflow its boundsand woe to those who happen to be nearby  Ritual precautions are intended both to prevent this flooding and to  offer protection insofar as it is possible to those who find themselves  in the path of ritual impuritythat is caught in the floodtide of vio lence   The slightest outbreak of violence can bring about a catastrophic  escalation Though we may tend to lose sight of this fact in our own  daily lives we are intellectually aware of its validity and are often  reminded that there is something infectious about the spectacle of  violence Indeed at times it is impossible to stay immune from the  infection Where violence is concerned intolerance can prove as fatal  an attitude as tolerance for when it breaks out it can happen that those  who oppose its progress do more to assure its triumph than those who  endorse it There is no universal rule for quelling violence no principle     Sacrifice 31   of guaranteed effectiveness At times all the remedies harsh as well as  gentle seem efficacious at other times every measure seems to  heighten the fever it is striving to abate   Inevitably the moment comes when violence can only be countered  by more violence Whether we fail or succeed in our effort to subdue  it the real victor is always violence itself The mimetic attributes of  violence are extraordinarysometimes direct and positive at other  times indirect and negative The more men strive to curb their violent  impulses the more these impulses seem to prosper The very weapons  used to combat violence are turned against their users Violence is like  a raging fire that feeds on the very objects intended to smother its  flames   The metaphor of fire could well give way to metaphors of tempest  flood earthquake Like the plague the resemblance violence bears to  these natural cataclysms is not limited to the realm of poetic imagery  In acknowledging that fact however we do not mean to endorse the  theory that sees in the sacred a simple transfiguration of natural phe nomena   The sacred consists of all those forces whose dominance over man  increases or seems to increase in proportion to mans effort to master  them Tempests forest fires and plagues among other phenomena  may be classified as sacred Far outranking these however though in a  far less obvious manner stands human violenceviolence seen as some thing exterior to man and henceforth as a part of all the other outside  forces that threaten mankind Violence is the heart and secret soul of  the sacred   We have yet to learn how man succeeds in positing his own violence  as an independent being Once he has accomplished this feat however  the sacred presence invades his universe mysteriously infects without  participating in it and buffets him about rather in the manner of a  plague or other natural disaster Once all this has occurred man is  confronted with a group of phenomena that despite their hetero geneous appearance exhibit remarkable similarities   As a general practice it is wise to avoid contact with the sick if one  wishes to stay healthy Similarly it is wise to steer clear of homicides if  one is eager not to be killed   As we see it these are two distinct types of contagion Modern  science concerns itself exclusively with one type and has established its  reality beyond all dispute However the other type could well be of  greater importance to the members of a society that we have defined as  primitivethat is a society lacking legal sanctions   Religious thought encompasses a large body of phenomena under the  heading of ritual impurityphenomena that seem disparate and absurd     32 Violence and the Sacred   from the viewpoint of modern science but whose relationship and  reality become perfectly clear when tested for the presence of basic  violence the prime ingredient and ultimate resource of the whole sys tem   There are undeniable similarities for instance between a bout of  serious illness and an act of violence wilfully perpetrated by an enemy  The sufferings of the invalid are analogous to those of the wounded  victim and if the invalid runs the risk of dying so too do all those who  are involved in one fashion or another either actively or passively in a  violent action Death is nothing more than the worst form of violence  that can befall a man It is no less reasonable therefore to lump to gether all the possible causes of death pathological and otherwise than  it is to create a separate category for only one of them sickness   To understand religious thought requires an empirical approach  The goal of religious thinking is exactly the same as that of technologi cal researchnamely practical action Whenever man is truly con cerned with obtaining concrete results whenever he is hard pressed by  reality he abandons abstract speculation and reverts to a mode of  response that becomes increasingly cautious and conservative as the  forces he hopes to subdue or at least to outrun draw ever nearer   In its simplest perhaps most elementary form religion manifests  little curiosity about the origins of those terrible forces that visit their  fury on mankind but seems to concentrate its attention on determining  a regular sequential pattern that will enable man to anticipate these  onslaughts and take measures against them   Religious empiricism invariably leads to one conclusion it is essen tial to keep as far away as possible from sacred things always to avoid  direct contact with them Naturally such thinking occasionally coin cides with medical empiricism or with scientific empiricism in general  This is why some observers insist on regarding religious empiricism as  a preliminary stage of science   This same empiricism however can sometimes reach conclusions so  utterly foreign to our own way of thinking and can show itself so  narrow inflexible and myopic in its attitudes that we are tempted to  attribute its functioning to some sort of psychological malaise Such a  reaction leads us to regard primitive society as an ailing society  beside which our civilized society presents a picture of radiant  health   The adherents of this theory show no hesitation in standing these  categories on their heads however whenever the need arises Thus on  occasion it is civilization that is sick and because civilized society is  the antithesis of primitive society it now appears that the primitive     Sacrifice 33   sphere must be the healthy one Manipulate them as one will it looks as  if the concepts of sickness and health are not very useful in clarifying  the relationship between primitive societies and our own   Ritual precautions that appear lunatic or at least highly exaggerated  in a modern context are in fact quite reasonable when viewed in their  proper contextthat is in the context of religions complete unaware ness of the violence it makes sacred When men believe that they can  actually feel the breath of a Homeric Cyclops at their backs they are  apt to resort to all means at their disposal to embrace all possible  precautions It seems safer to overreact than to underreact   This religious attitude is not dissimilar to that of medicine when  suddenly confronted with an unknown disease An epidemic breaks  out the doctors and scientists are unable to isolate the pathogenic  agent Under the circumstances what should they do Clearly they  must adopt not some of the precautionary measures employed against  familiar diseases but all of them without exception Ideally they  would invent entirely new measures since the enemy they are fighting  is itself employing new weapons   Once the microbe has been identified it is seen that some of the  measures employed were completely useless and should be abandoned  in any future dealings with the disease Yet it must be admitted that as  long as the cause of the illness was unknown their use was fully  justified   We must be careful not to push our metaphor too far Neither  primitive nor modern man has yet succeeded in identifying the mi crobe responsible for the dread disease of violence Western civiliza tion is hindered in its efforts to isolate and analyze the causes and to  examine them in any but the most superficial manner because it has  enjoyed until this day a mysterious immunity from the most virulent  forms of violencean immunity not it seems of our societys making  but one that has perhaps resulted in the making of our society   k AMONG PRIMITIVE TABOOS the one that has per haps been most analyzed is the taboo surrounding menstrual blood  Menstrual blood is regarded as impure menstruating women are segre gated from the community They are forbidden to touch any objects of  communal usage sometimes even their own food for risk of contami nation   If we wish to understand why menstruation is considered impure  we must consider it within the general category of bloodletting Most  primitive peoples take the utmost care to avoid contact with blood  Spilt blood of any origin unless it has been associated with a sacrificial     34 Violence and the Sacred   act is considered impure This universal attribution of impurity to  spilt blood springs directly from the definition we have just proposed  wherever violence threatens ritual impurity is present When men are  enjoying peace and security blood is a rare sight When violence is  unloosed however blood appears everywhereon the ground under foot forming great pools Its very fluidity gives form to the contagious  nature of violence Its presence proclaims murder and announces new  upheavals to come Blood stains everything it touches the color of  violence and death Its very appearance seems as the saying goes to  cry out for vengeance   Any bloodletting is frightening It is only natural therefore that  menstrual bleeding should awaken fear However there is another  complicating element at work here Although menstrual bleeding can  be readily distinguished from blood spilt in a murder or an accident  and can thus be dissociated from those virulent forms of violence it is  in many societies regarded as the most impure of impurities We can  only assume that this extreme reaction has to do with the sexual aspect  of menstruation   Sexuality is one of those primary forces whose sovereignty over man  is assured by man s firm belief in his sovereignty over it The most  extreme forms of violence can never be directly sexual because they  are collective in nature The group is quite capable of perpetrating a  single coherent act of violence whose force is increased with the  addition of each individual quotient of violence but sexuality is never  truly collective That fact alone explains why sexual interpretations of  the sacred invariably ignore or play down the role of violence whereas  an interpretation based on violence readily grants sexuality the prom inent place it occupies in all primitive religions We are tempted to  conclude that violence is impure because of its relation to sexuality Yet  only the reverse proposition can withstand close scrutiny Sexuality is  impure because it has to do with violence   Such an idea seems to run counter to the spirit of contemporary  humanism which has settled into a friendly accord with the pansexu alism of the psychoanalysts and remains unruffled even by the death wish theory Nonetheless the signs are too numerous and too clear to  be ignored We have conceded that menstrual blood has a direct rela tionship to sexuality we also contend that its relationship to unleashed  violence is even closer The blood of a murdered man is impure This  impurity cannot be derived from the impurity attributed to menstrual  blood On the other hand to understand the impurity of menstrual  blood we must trace its relationship to blood spilt by violence as well  as to sexuality The fact that the sexual organs of women periodically     Sacrifice 35   emit a flow of blood has always made a great impression on men it  seems to confirm an affinity between sexuality and those diverse forms  of violence that invariably lead to bloodshed   To understand the nature and extent of this affinity we must return  to that solid core of common sense that plays a far greater role in  religious thinking than fashionable theorists are willing to acknowl edge In fact the notion that the beliefs of all mankind are a grand  mystification that we alone have succeeded in penetrating is a hardy  perennialas well as being to say the least somewhat arrogant The  problem at hand is not the arrogance of Western science nor its blatant  imperialism but rather its sheer inadequacy It is precisely when the  need to understand becomes most urgent that the explanations pro posed in the domain of religion become most unsatisfactory   The connection between sexuality and religion is a heritage common  to all religions and is supported by an impressive array of convergent  facts Sex and violence frequently come to grips in such direct forms as  abduction rape defloration and various sadistic practices as well as in  indirect actions of indefinite consequences Sex is at the origin of vari ous illnesses real or imaginary it culminates in the bloody labors of  childbirth which may entail the death of mother child or both to gether Even within the ritualistic framework of marriage when all the  matrimonial vows and other interdictions have been conscientiously  observed sexuality is accompanied by violence and as soon as one  trespasses beyond the limits of matrimony to engage in illicit relation shipsincest adultery and the likethe violence and the impurity  resulting from this violence grows more potent and extreme Sexuality  leads to quarrels jealous rages mortal combats It is a permanent  source of disorder even within the most harmonious of communities   In refusing to admit an association between sexuality and violence  an association readily acknowledged by men over the course of several  millenniamodern thinkers are attempting to prove their broadmind edness and liberality Their stance has led to numerous misconceptions  Like violence sexual desire tends to fasten upon surrogate objects if  the object to which it was originally attracted remains inaccessible it  willingly accepts substitutes And again like violence repressed sexual  desire accumulates energy that sooner or later bursts forth causing  tremendous havoc It is also worth noting that the shift from violence  to sexuality and from sexuality to violence is easily effected even by  the most normal of individuals totally lacking in perversion  Thwarted sexuality leads naturally to violence just as lovers quarrels  often end in an amorous embrace Recent scientific findings seem to  justify the primitive perspective on many points Sexual excitement     36 Violence and the Sacred   and violent impulses manifest themselves in the same manner In both  instances the majority of discernible bodily reactions are identical15   Before we attempt to explain away the taboo on menstrual blood by  means of some allinclusive generalized interpretationbefore for  example we invoke those phantasms that play the same role in our  consciousness as do the enchanters tricks in Don Quixoteswe  should make quite sure that we have first exhausted all direct avenues  to comprehension In fact there is nothing incomprehensible about the  viewpoint that sees menstrual blood as a physical representation of  sexual violence We ought however to go further to inquire whether  this process of symbolization does not respond to some halfsuppressed  desire to place the blame for all forms of violence on women By  means of this taboo a transfer of violence has been effected and a  monopoly established that is clearly detrimental to the female sex    Q a l  THE TAINT OF impurity cannot always be avoided  even the most careful precautions are no security against it And the  least contact with the infection can contaminate the entire community   How can one cleanse the infected members of all trace of pollution  Does there exist some miraculous substance potent enough not only to  resist infection but also to purify if need be the contaminated blood  Only blood itself blood whose purity has been guaranteed by the  performance of appropriate ritesthe blood in short of sacrificial  victimscan accomplish this feat   Behind this astonishing paradox the menace of violent action can be  discerned All concepts of impurity stem ultimately from the com munitys fear of a perpetual cycle of violence arising in its midst The  menace is always the same and provokes the same set of responses the  same sacrificial gestures designed to redirect the violence onto inconse quential victims The idea of ritual purification is far more than mere  shadow play or illusion   The function of ritual is to purify violence that is to trick  violence into spending itself on victims whose death will provoke no  reprisals Because the secret of this mechanism is unknown to the  participants in the rites religion tries to account for its own operation  metaphorically using for that purpose the objects and materials in volved in that operation The properties of blood for example vividly  illustrate the entire operation of violence We have already spoken of  blood spilt by mischance or malice Blood that dries on the victim soon  loses its viscous quality and becomes first a dark sore then a rough ened scab Blood that is allowed to congeal on its victim is the impure   15 Storr Human Aggression pp 1819     Sacrifice 57   product of violence illness or death In contrast to this contaminated  substance is the fresh blood of newly slaughtered victims crimson and  free flowing This blood is never allowed to congeal but is removed  without trace as soon as the rites have been concluded   The physical metamorphosis of spilt blood can stand for the double  nature of violence Some religious practices make elaborate use of this  duality Blood serves to illustrate the point that the same substance can  stain or cleanse contaminate or purify drive men to fury and murder  or appease their anger and restore them to life   We are not dealing here with one of Gaston Bachelards material  metaphors a poetic recreation of little real consequence Nor does  Laura Makariuss suggestion that the ambiguous character of blood is  in fact the ultimate reality behind the constant reversals of primitive  religion seem wholly apposite here16 Both authors lose sight of a  crucial point the paradoxical nature of violence Although religion  grasps this paradoxand that only tentativelymostly by means of  such symbolic representations as that of blood it differs radically from  modern theory which speaks of phantasms and poetry and does  not even realize how real the sacrificial process can be and how ap propriate the major metaphors and symbols through which it is ex pressed   Even the wildest aberrations of religious thought still manage to bear  witness to the fact that evil and the violent measures taken to combat  evil are essentially the same At times violence appears to man in its  most terrifying aspect wantonly sowing chaos and destruction at  other times it appears in the guise of peacemaker graciously distribut ing the fruits of sacrifice   The secret of the dual nature of violence still eludes men Beneficial  violence must be carefully distinguished from harmful violence and  the former continually promoted at the expense of the latter Ritual is  nothing more than the regular exercise of good violence As we have  remarked if sacrificial violence is to be effective it must resemble the  nonsacrificial variety as closely as possible That is why some rites may  seem to us nothing more than senseless inversions of prohibited acts  For instance in some societies menstrual blood is regarded as a benefi cial substance when employed in certain rites but retains its baleful  character in other contexts   The twoinone nature of bloodthat is of violenceis strikingly  illustrated in Euripides1 Ion The Athenian queen Creusa plots to do  away with the hero by means of an exotic talisman two drops of  blood from the deadly Gorgon One drop is a deadly poison the other   16Cf Laura Makarius Les Tabous du forgeron Diogene 62 AprilJune  1968     38 Violence and the Sacred   a miraculous healing agent The queens old slave asks her the origin of  this substance   Creusa When the fatal blow was struck a drop spurted  from the hollow vein      Slave How is it used What are its properties  Creusa It wards off all sickness and nourishes life  Slave And the other drop  Creusa It kills It is made from the Gorgon s venomous   serpents  Slave Do you carry them mixed together or separate  Creusa Are good and evil to be mixed together   Separate of course   Nothing could seem more alike than two drops of blood yet in this  case nothing could be more different It is only too easy to blend them  together and produce a substance that would efface all distinction be tween the pure and the impure Then the difference between good  and bad violence would be eliminated as well As long as purity and  impurity remain distinct even the worst pollution can be washed  away but once they are allowed to mingle purification is no longer  possible         Chapter Two   The Sacrificial Crisis   nYJj l A S W E HAVE SEEN the proper functioning of the     N  sacrificial process requires not only the complete separa  tion of the sacrificed victim from those beings for whom the victim  is a substitute but also a similarity between both parties This dual  requirement can be fulfilled only through a delicately balanced mecha nism of associations   Any change however slight in the hierarchical classification of liv ing creatures risks undermining the whole sacrificial structure The  sheer repetition of the sacrificial actthe repeated slaughter of the  same type of victiminevitably brings about such change But the  inability to adapt to new conditions is a trait characteristic of religion  in general If as is often the case we encounter the institution of  sacrifice either in an advanced state of decay or reduced to relative  insignificance it is because it has already undergone a good deal of  wear and tear   Whether the slippage in the mechanism is due to too little or too  much contact between the victim and those whom the victim repre sents the results are the same The elimination of violence is no longer  effected on the contrary conflicts within the community multiply  and the menace of chain reactions looms ever larger   If the gap between the victim and the community is allowed to grow  too wide all similarity wrill be destroyed The victim will no longer be  capable of attracting the violent impulses to itself the sacrifice will  cease to serve as a good conductor in the sense that metal is a good  conductor of electricity On the other hand if there is too much  continuity the violence will overflow its channels Impure violence  will mingle with the sacred violence of the rites turning the latter  into a scandalous accomplice in the process of pollution even a kind of  catalyst in the propagation of further impurity   These are postulates that seem to take form a priori from our earlier  conclusions They can also be discerned in literaturein the adapta tions of certain myths in classical Greek tragedy in particular in  Euripides version of the legend of Heracles   Euripides1 Heracles contains no tragic conflict no debate between   39     40 Violence and the Sacred   declared adversaries The real subject of the play is the failure of a  sacrifice the act of sacrificial violence that suddenly goes wrong  Heracles returning home after the completion of his labors finds his  wife and children in the power of a usurper named Lycus who is  preparing to offer them as sacrificial victims Heracles kills Lycus  After this most recent act of violence committed in the heart of the  city the heros need to purify himself is greater than ever and he sets  about preparing a sacrifice of his own His wife and children are with  him when Heracles suddenly seized by madness mistakes them for his  enemies and sacrifices them   Heracles misidentification of his family is attributed to Lyssa god dess of madness who is operating as an emissary of two other god desses Iris and Hera who bear Heracles ill will The preparations for  the sacrifice provide an imposing setting for the homicidal outburst it  is unlikely that their dramatic significance passed unnoticed by the  author In fact it is Euripides himself who directs our attention to the  ritualistic origins of the onslaught After the massacre Heracles fa ther Amphitryon asks his son My child what happened to you  How could this horror have taken place Was it perhaps the spilt  blood that turned your head Heracles who is just returning to con sciousness and remembers nothing inquires in turn Where did the  madness overtake me Where did it strike me down Amphitryon  replies Near the altar where you were purifying your hands over  the sacred flames   The sacrifice contemplated by the hero succeeded only too well in  polarizing the forces of violence Indeed it produced a superabun dance of violence of a particularly virulent kind As Amphitryon sug gested the blood shed in the course of the terrible labors and in the  city itself finally turned the heros head Instead of drawing off the  violence and allowing it to ebb away the rites brought a veritable  flood of violence down on the victim The sacrificial rites were no  longer able to accomplish their task they swelled the surging tide of  impure violence instead of channeling it The mechanism of substitu tions had gone astray and those whom the sacrifice was designed to  protect became its victims   The difference between sacrificial and nonsacrificial violence is any thing but exact it is even arbitrary At times the difference threatens  to disappear entirely There is no such thing as truly pure violence  Nevertheless sacrificial violence can in the proper circumstances  serve as an agent of purification That is why those who perform the  rites are obliged to purify themselves at the conclusion of the sacrifice  The procedure followed is reminiscent of atomic power plants when     The Sacrificial Crisis 41   the expert has finished decontaminating the installation he must him self be decontaminated And accidents can always happen   The catastrophic inversion of the sacrificial act would appear to be  an essential element in the Heracles myth The motif reappears thinly  concealed behind secondary themes in another episode of his story in  Sophocles The Women of Trachis   Heracles had mortally wounded the centaur Nessus who had as saulted Heracles wife Deianira Before dying the centaur gave the  young woman a shirt smeared with his spermor in Sophocles1 ver sion smeared with his blood mixed with the blood of a Hydra Once  again as in the Ion we encounter the theme of the two kinds of blood  mingling to form one   The subject of the tragedy as in Euripides Heracles is the return of  the hero In this instance Heracles is bringing with him a pretty young  captive of whom Deianira is jealous Deianira sends a servant to her  husband with a welcoming gift the shirt of Nessus With his dying  breath the centaur had told her that the shirt would assure the wearers  eternal fidelity to her but he cautioned her to keep it well out of the  way of any flame or source of heat   Heracles puts on the shirt and soon afterward lights a fire for the  rites of sacrificial purification The flames activate the poison in the  shirt it is the rite itself that unlooses the evil Heracles contorted with  pain presently ends his life on the pyre he has begged his son to  prepare Before dying Heracles kills the servant who delivered the  shirt to him this death along with his own and the subsequent suicide  of his wife contributes to the cycle of violence heralded by Heracles  return and the failure of the sacrifice Once again violence has struck  the beings who sought the protection of sacrificial rites   A number of sacrifice motifs intermingle in these two plays A spe cial sort of impurity clings to the warrior returning to his homeland  still tainted with the slaughter of war In the case of Heracles his  sanguinary labors render him particularly impure   The returning warrior risks carrying the seed of violence into the  very heart of his city The myth of Horatius as explicated by Georges  Dumezil illustrates this theme Horatius kills his sister before any  ritual purification has been performed In the case of Heracles the  impurity triumphs over the rite itself   If we examine the mechanism of violence in these two tragedies we  notice that when the sacrifice goes wrong it sets off a chain reaction of  the sort defined in the first chapter The murder of Lycus is presented  in the Euripides play as a last labor of the hero a stillrational pre lude to the insane outburst that follows Seen from the perspective of  the ritualist it might well constitute a first link of impure violence     42 Violence and the Sacred   With this incident as we have noted violence invades the heart of the  city This initial murder corresponds to the death of the old servant in  The Women of Trachis   Supernatural intervention plays no part in these episodes except  perhaps to cast a thin veil over the true subject the sacrificial celebra tion that has gone wrong The goddess Lyssa Nessus shirtthese add  nothing to the meaning of the two stories rather they act as a veil  and as soon as the veil is drawn aside we encounter the same theme of  good violence turning into bad The mythological accompani ments of the stories can be seen as redundant Lyssa the goddess of  madness sounds more like a refugee from an allegorical tale than a real  goddess and Nessus shirt joins company with all the acts of violence  that Heracles carries on his back   The theme of the Warriors Return is not strictly speaking  mythological and readily lends itself to sociological or psychological  interpretations The conquering hero who threatens to destroy the  liberty of his homeland belongs to history not myth Certainly that is  the way Corneille seems to approach the subject in Horace although  in his version of the tale the ideology is somewhat reversedthe re turning warrior is rightly shocked by his sisters lack of patriotism We  could easily translate the case histories of Heracles and Horatius into  psychological or psychoanalytical terms and come up with numerous  working theories each at variance with the other But we should avoid  this temptation for in debating the relative merits of each theory we  would lose sight of the role played by rituala subject that has noth ing to do with such debates even though it may as we shall see open  the way to them Being more primitive ritualistic action is hospitable  to all ideological interpretations and dependent on none It has only  one axiom the contagious nature of the violence encountered by the  warrior in battleand only one prescription the proper performance  of ritual purification Its sole purpose is to prevent the resurgence of  violence and its spread throughout the community   The two tragedies we have been discussing present in anecdotal  form as if dealing exclusively with exceptional individuals events that  are significant because they affect the community as a whole Sacrifice  is a social act and when it goes amiss the consequences are not limited  to some exceptional individual singled out by Destiny   Historians seem to agree that Greek tragedy belonged to a period of  transition between the dominance of an archaic theocracy and the  emergence of a new modern order based on statism and laws Before  its decline the archaic order must have enjoyed a certain stability and  this stability must have reposed on its religious elementthat is on the  sacrificial rites     The Sacrificial Crisis 45   Although they predate the tragedians the preSocratics are often  regarded as the philosophers of classical tragedy In their writings we  can find echoes of the religious crisis we are attempting to define The  fifth fragment of Heraclitus quite clearly deals with the decay of  sacrificial rites with their inability to purify what is impure Religious  beliefs are compromised by the decadent state of the ritual In vain  do they strive for purification by besmirching themselves with blood  as the man who has bathed in the mire seeks to cleanse himself with  mud Such antics can only strike the beholder as utter folly In address ing their prayers to images of the gods they might just as well be  speaking to the walls without seeking to know the true nature of gods  or heroes   The difference between blood spilt for ritual and for criminal pur poses no longer holds The Heraclitus fragment appears in even  sharper relief when compared to analogous passages in the Old Testa ment The preexilian prophets Amos Isaiah and Micah denounce in  vehement terms the impotence of the sacrificial process and ritual in  general In the most explicit manner they link the decay of religious  practices to the deterioration of contemporary behavior Inevitably  the eroding of the sacrificial system seems to result in the emergence of  reciprocal violence Neighbors who had previously discharged their  mutual aggressions on a third party joining together in the sacrifice of  an outside victim now turn to sacrificing one another Empedocles  Purifications brings us even closer to the problem   136 When will the sinister noise of this carnage cease Can you not see  that you are devouring one another with your callous hearts  137 The father seizes hold of the son who has changed form in his  mad delusion he kills him murmuring prayers The son cries out im ploring his insane executioner to spare him But the father hears him  not and cuts his throat and spreads a great feast in his palace In the  same way the son takes hold of the father the children their mother  one slaughtering the other and devouring their own flesh and blood   The concept of a sacrificial crisis may be useful in clarifying  certain aspects of Greek tragedy To a real extent it is sacrificial reli gion that provides the language for these dramas the criminal in the  plays sees himself not so much as a righterofwrongs as a performerof sacrifices We always view the tragic flaw from the perspective of  the new emergent order never from that of the old order in the final  stages of decay The reason for this approach is clear modern thought  has never been able to attribute any real function to the practice of  sacrifice and because the nature of the practice eludes us we naturally  find it difficult to determine when and if this practice is in the process     44 Violence and the Sacred   of disintegration In the case of Greek tragedy it is not enough merely  to believe in the existence of the old order we must look deeper if we  hope to discover the religious problems of the era Unlike the Jewish  prophets whose viewpoint was historical the Greek tragedians evoked  their own sacrificial crisis in terms of legendary figures whose forms  were fixed by tradition   All the bloody events that serve as background to the playsthe  plagues and pestilences civil and foreign warsundoubtedly reflect  the contemporary scene but the images are unclear as if viewed  through a glass darkly Each time for example a play of Euripides  deals with the collapse of a royal house as in Heracles Iphigenia in  Aulis or The Bacchae we are convinced that the poet is suggesting  that the scene before our eyes is only the tip of the iceberg that the  real issue is the fate of the entire community At the moment when  Heracles is slaughtering his family offstage the chorus cries out Look  look The tempest is shaking the house the roof is falling in   If the tragic crisis is indeed to be described in terms of the sacrificial  crisis its relationship to sacrifice should be apparent in all aspects of  tragedyeither conveyed directly through explicit reference or per ceived indirectly in broad outline underlying the texture of the  drama   If the art of tragedy is to be defined in a single phrase we might do  worse than call attention to one of its most characteristic traits the  opposition of symmetrical elements There is no aspect of the plot  form or language of a tragedy in which this symmetrical pattern does  not recur The third actor for instance hardly constitutes the innova tion that critics have claimed Third actor or no third actor the core  of the drama remains the tragic dialogue that is the fateful confronta tion during which the two protagonists exchange insults and accusa tions with increasing earnestness and rapidity The Greek public  brought to these verbal contests the same educated sense of apprecia tion that French audiences many centuries later evinced for their own  classic dramafor Theramenes famous speech from the last act of  Phedre for example or for almost any passage from Le Cid   The symmetry of the tragic dialogue is perfectly mirrored by the  stichomythia in which the two protagonists address one another in  alternating lines In tragic dialogue hot words are substituted for cold  steel But whether the violence is physical or verbal the suspense re mains the same The adversaries match blow for blow and they seem  so evenly matched that it is impossible to predict the outcome of the  battle The structural similarity between the two forms of violence is  illustrated by the description of the duel between the brothers Eteocles  and Polyneices in Euripides Phoenicia Women There is nothing in     The Sacrificial Crisis 45   this account that does not apply equally to both brothers their parries  thrusts and feints their gestures and postures are identical If either  saw the others eye peer over the rim of his shield He raised his  spear   Polyneices loses his spear in the fight and so does Eteocles Both are  wounded Each blow upsets the equilibrium threatening to decide the  outcome then and there It is immediately followed by a new blow that  not only redresses the balance but creates a symmetrical disequilibrium  that is itself naturally enough of short duration The tragic suspense  follows the rhythm of these rapid exchanges each one of which prom ises to bring matters to a headbut never quite does so They strug gle now on even terms each having spent his spear Swords are  unsheathed and the two brothers are locked in close combat Shield  clashes with shield and a great clamor engulfs them both Even death  fails to tip the balance They hit the dust and lay together side by  side and their heritage was still unclaimed   The death of the brothers resolves nothing it simply perpetuates the  symmetry of the battle Each had been his armys champion and the  two armies now resume the struggle reestablish the symmetry Oddly  enough however the conflict is now transferred to a purely verbal  plane transforming itself into a true tragic dialogue Tragedy now  assumes its proper function as a verbal extension of physical combat  an interminable debate set off by the chronically indecisive character  of an act of violence committed previously   The soldiers then leapt to their feet and the argument began We  claimed that our king had won they claimed the victory for Polyneices  The captains quarreled too Some said that Polyneices had struck the  first blow others replied that death had snatched the palm of victory  from both claimants   The indecisiveness of the first combat spreads quite naturally to the  second which then sows it abroad The tragic dialogue is a debate  without resolution Each side resolutely continues to deploy the same  arguments emphases goals Gleichgewicht is Holderlins word for it  Tragedy is the balancing of the scale not of justice but of violence  No sooner is something added to one side of the scale than its equiva lent is contributed to the other The same insults and accusations fly  from one combatant to the other as a ball flies from one player to  another in tennis The conflict stretches on interminably because be tween the two adversaries there is no difference whatsoever   The equilibrium in the struggle has often been attributed to a so called tragic impartiality Holderlins word is lmpmrtialitat I do not  find this interpretation quite satisfactory Impartiality implies a delib    H Violence and the Sacred   erate refusal to take sides a firm commitment to treat both contes tants equally The impartial party is not eager to resolve the issue does  not want to know if there is a resolution nor does he maintain that  resolution is impossible His impartialityatanyprice is not unfre quently simply an unsubstantiated assertion of superiority One of the  adversaries is right the other wrong and the onlooker is obliged to  take sides either that or the rights and wrongs are so evenly distrib uted between the two factions that taking sides is impossible The self proclaimed advocate of impartiality does not want to commit himself  to either course of action If pushed toward one camp he seeks refuge  in the other Men always find it distasteful to admit that the reasons  on both sides of a dispute are equally validwhich is to say that  violence operates without reason   Tragedy begins at that point where the illusion of impartiality as  well as the illusions of the adversaries collapses For example in Oedi pus the King Oedipus Creon and Tiresias are each in turn drawn into  a conflict that each had thought to resolve in the role of impartial  mediator   It is not clear to what extent the tragedians themselves managed to  remain impartial For example Euripides in The Phoenician Women  barely conceals his preference for Eteoclesor perhaps we should say  his preference for the Athenian publics approval In any case his  partiality is superficial The preferences registered for one side or an other never prevent the authors from constantly underlining the sym metrical relationship between the adversaries   At the very moment when they appear to be abandoning impartial ity the tragedians do their utmost to deprive the audience of any  means of taking sides Aeschylus Sophocles and Euripides all utilize  the same procedures and almost identical phraseology to convey  symmetry identity reciprocity We encounter here an aspect of  tragic art that has been largely overlooked by contemporary criticism  Nowadays critics tend to assess a work of art on the basis of its origi idity To the extent that an author cannot claim exclusive rights to his  themes his style and his esthetic effects his work is deemed deficient  In the domain of esthetics singularity reigns supreme   Such criteria cannot apply of course to Greek tragedy whose au thors were not committed to the doctrine of originality at any price  Nevertheless our frustrated individualism still exerts a deleterious  effect on modern interpretations of Greek tragedy   It is readily apparent that Aeschylus Sophocles and Euripides  shared certain literary traits and that the characters in their plays have  certain characteristics in common Yet there is no reason to label these  resemblances mere stereotypes It is my belief that these stereotypes     The Sacrificial Crisis 41   contain the very essence of Greek tragedy And if the tragic element  in these plays still eludes us it is because we have obstinately averted  our attention from these similarities   The tragedians portray men and women caught up in a form of  violence too impersonal in its workings too brutal in its results to  allow any sort of value judgement any sort of distinction subtle or  simplistic to be drawn between good1 and wicked characters That  is why most modern interpretations go astray we have still not extri cated ourselves entirely from the Manichean frame of reference that  gained sway in the Romantic era and still exerts its influence today   In Greek tragedy violence invariably effaces the differences between  antagonists The sheer impossibility of asserting their differences fuels  the rage of Eteocles and Polyneices In Euripides Heracles the hero  kills Lycus to keep him from sacrificing his family and next he does  what he wanted to prevent his enemy from doing thereby falling  victim to the ironic humor of a Destiny that seems to work hand in  glove with violence In the end it is Heracles who carries out the crime  meditated by his counterpart The more a tragic conflict is prolonged  the more likelv it is to culminate in a violent mimesis the resemblance  between the combatants grows ever stronger until each presents a  mirror image of the other There is a scientific corollary modern  research suggests that individuals of quite different makeup and back ground respond to violence in essentially the same way   It is the act of reprisal the repetition of imitative acts of violence  that characterizes tragic plotting The destruction of differences is  particularly spectacular when the hierarchichal distance between the  characters the amount of respect due from one to the other is great  between father and son for instance This scandalous effacement of  distinctions is apparent in Euripides Alcestis Father and son are en gaged in a tragic dialogue each accuses the other of fleeing from death  and leaving the heroine to die The symmetry is perfect emphasized  by the symmetrical interventions of the members of the Chorus who  first castigate the son Young man remember to whom you are  speaking do not insult your father and then rebuke the father  Enough has been said on this subject cease we pray you to abuse  your own son   In Oedipus the King Sophocles frequently puts in Oedipuss mouth  words that emphasize his resemblance to his father resemblance in  desires suspicions and course of action If the hero throws himself  impetuously into the investigation that causes his downfall it is be cause he is reacting just as Laius did in seeking out the potential assassin  who according to the oracles would replace him on the throne of  Thebes and in the bed of the queen     48 Violence and the Sacred   Oedipus finally kills Laius but it is Laius who at the crossroads first  raised his hand against his son The patricide thus takes part in a  reciprocal exchange of murderous gestures It is an act of reprisal in a  universe based on reprisals   At the core of the Oedipus myth as Sophocles presents it is the  proposition that all masculine relationships are based on reciprocal acts  of violence Laius taking his cue from the oracle violently rejects  Oedipus out of fear that his son will seize his throne and invade his  conjugal bed Oedipus taking his cue from the oracle does away with  Laius violently rebuffs the sphinx then takes their placesas king and  scourge of the city respectively Again Oedipus taking his cue  from the oracle plots the death of that unknown figure who may be  seeking to usurp his own position Oedipus Creon and Tiresias each  taking his cue from the oracle seek one anothers downfall   All these acts of violence gradually wear away the differences that  exist not only in the same family but throughout the community The  tragic combat between Oedipus and Tiresias pits the communitys  chief spiritual leaders against one another The enraged Oedipus seeks  to strip the aura of mystery1 from his rival to prove that he is a false  prophet nothing more   Come tell us have you truly shown yourself a prophet When the  terrible sphinx held sway over our countrymen did you ever whisper  the words that would have delivered them That riddle was not to be  answered by anyone the gift of prophecy was called for Yet that gift  was clearly not yours to give nor was it ever granted to you either by  the birds or by the gods   Confronted by the kings frustration and rage at being unable to  uncover the truth Tiresias launches his own challenge The terms are  much the same If you are so clever at solving enigmas why are you  powerless to solve this one Both parties in this tragic dialogue have  recourse to the same tactics use the same weapons and strive for the  same goal destruction of the adversary Tiresias poses as the champion  of tradition taking up the cudgels on behalf of the oracles flouted by  Oedipus However in so doing he shows himself insolent to royal  authority Although the targets are individuals it is the institutions  that receive the blows Legitimate authority trembles on its pedestal  and the combatants finally assist in the downfall of the very order they  strove to maintain The impiety referred to by the chorusthe neglect  of the oracles the general decadence that pervades the religion of the  communityare surely part of the same phenomenon that works away  at the undermining of family relationships as well as of religious and  social hierarchies     The Sacrificial Crisis 49   The sacrificial crisis that is the disappearance of the sacrificial rites  coincides with the disappearance of the difference between impure  violence and purifying violence When this difference has been ef faced purification is no longer possible and impure contagious re ciprocal violence spreads throughout the community   The sacrificial distinction the distinction between the pure and the  impure cannot be obliterated without obliterating all other differences  as well One and the same process of violent reciprocity engulfs the  whole The sacrificial crisis can be defined therefore as a crisis of  distinctionsthat is a crisis affecting the cultural order This cultural  order is nothing more than a regulated system of distinctions in which  the differences among individuals are used to establish their identity  and their mutual relationships   In the first chapter the danger threatening the community with the  decay of sacrificial practices was portrayed in terms of physical vio lence of cyclical vengeance set off by a chain reaction We now  discover more insidious forms of the same evil When the religious  framework of a society starts to totter it is not exclusively or immedi ately the physical security of the society that is threatened rather the  whole cultural foundation of the society is put in jeopardy The insti tutions lose their vitality the protective facade of the society gives  way social values are rapidly eroded and the whole cultural structure  seems on the verge of collapse   The hidden violence of the sacrificial crisis eventually succeeds in  destroying distinctions and this destruction in turn fuels the renewed  violence In short it seems that anything that adversely affects the  institution of sacrifice will ultimately pose a threat to the very basis of  the community to the principles on which its social harmony and  equilibrium depend       i A SINGLE PRINCIPLE is at work in primitive religion  and classical tragedy alike a principle implicit but fundamental Order  peace and fecundity depend on cultural distinctions it is not these  distinctions but the loss of them that gives birth to fierce rivalries and  sets members of the same family or social group at one anothers  throats   Modern society aspires to equality among men and tends instinc tively to regard all differences even those unrelated to the economic  or social status of men as obstacles in the path of human happiness  This modern ideal exerts an obvious influence on ethnological ap proaches although more often on the level of technical procedure than  that of explicit principle The permutations of this ideal are complex  rich in potential contradictions and difficult to characterize briefly     SO Violence and the Sacred   Suffice it to say that an antidifferentiar prejudice often falsifies the  ethnological outlook not only on the origins of discord and conflict  but also on all religious modes Although usually implicit its principles  are explicitly set forth in Victor Turners The Ritual Process Struc tural differentiation both vertical and horizontal is the foundation of  strife and factionalism and of struggles in dyadic relations between  incumbents of positions or rivals for positions1 When differences  come unhinged they are generally identified as the cause of those rival ries for which they also furnish the stakes This has not always been  their role As in the case of sacrificial rites when they no longer serve  as a dam against violence they serve to swell the flood   In order to rid ourselves of some fashionable intellectual attitudes  useful enough in their place but not always relevant in dealing with  the pastwe might turn to Shakespeare who in the course of the  famous speech of Ulysses in Troilus and Cressida makes some interest ing observations on the interaction of violence and differences The  point of view of primitive religion and Greek tragedy could not be  better summarized than by this speech   The Greek army has been besieging Troy for a long time and is  growing demoralized through want of action In commenting on their  position Ulysses strays from the particular to a general reflection on  the role of Degree or distinctions in human endeavors Degree  or gradus is the underlying principle of all order natural and cultural  It permits individuals to find a place for themselves in society it lends  a meaning to things arranging them in proper sequence within a hier archy it defines the objects and moral standards that men alter ma nipulate and transform The musical metaphor describes that order as  a structure in the modern sense of the word a system of chords  thrown into disharmony by the sudden intervention of reciprocal vio lence      O when Degree is shaked  Which is the ladder to all high designs  The enterprise is sick How could communities  Degrees in schools and brotherhoods in cities  Peaceful commerce from dividable shores  The primogenitive and due of birth  Prerogative of age crowns sceptres laurels  But by degree stand in authentic place  Take but degree away untune that string

rise to violence and chaos that inspires  Ulysses plaint This loss forces men into a perpetual confrontation  one that strips them of all their distinctive characteristicsin short of  their identities Language itself is put in jeopardy uEach thing  meetsIn mere oppugnancy the adversaries are reduced to indefinite  objects things that wantonly collide with each other like loose cargo  on the decks of a stormtossed ship The metaphor of the floodtide that  transforms the earths surface to a muddy mass is frequently employed  by Shakespeare to designate the undifferentiated state of the world that  is also portrayed in Genesis and that we have attributed to the sacrifi cial crisis   In this situation no one and nothing is spared coherent thinking  collapses and rational activities are abandoned All associative forms are  dissolved or become antagonistic all values spiritual or material per ish Of course formal education as represented by academic degrees  is rendered useless because its value derives from the now inoperative  principle of universal differentiation To say that this speech merely  reflects a Renaissance commonplace the great chain of being is unsat isfactory Who has ever seen a great chain of being collapse   Ulysses is a career soldier authoritarian in temper and conservative  in inclination Nevertheless the order he is committed to defend is  secretly acknowledged as arbitrary The end of distinctions means the  triumph of the strong over the weak the pitting of father against  sonthe end of all human justice which is here unexpectedly defined  in terms of differences among individuals If perfect equilibrium  invariably leads to violence as in Greek tragedy it follows that the  relative nonviolence guaranteed by human justice must be defined as a  sort of imbalance a difference between good and evil parallel to  the sacrificial difference between pure and impure The idea of  justice as a balanced scale an exercise in exquisite impartiality is ut terly foreign to this theory which sees the roots of justice in differ ences among men and the demise of justice in the elimination of these  differences Whenever the terrible equilibrium of tragedy prevails all  talk of right and wrong is futile At that point in the conflict one can  only say to the combatants Make friends or pursue your own ruin     52 Violence and the Sacred   4 IF THE TWOINONE crisis that we have described is  indeed a fundamental realityif the collapse of the cultural structure  of a society leads to reciprocal violence and if this collapse encourages  the spread of violence everywherethen we ought to see signs of this  reality outside the restricted realms of Greek tragedy or Shakespearean  drama The closer our contact with primitive societies the more rap idly these societies tend to lose their distinctive qualities but this loss is  in some cases effected through a sacrificial crisis And in some cases  these crises have been directly observed by ethnologists Scholarly  literature on the subject is rather extensive rarely however does a  coherent picture emerge More often than not the accounts are frag mentary mingled with commentary relating to purely structural mat ters A remarkable exception well worth our attention here is Jules  Henrys Jungle People which deals with the Kaingang Indians of  Santa Katarina in Brazil2 The author came to live with the Indians  shortly after they had been transferred to a reservation when the con sequences of that last and radical change had not yet completely taken  hold He was thus able to observe at first hand or through the testimony  of witnesses the process I call the sacrificial crisis   The extreme poverty of the Kaingang culture on a religious as well  as a technological level made a strong impression on Henry who at tributed it to the blood feuds that is the cyclical vengeance carried  on among close relatives To describe the effects of this reciprocal  violence he instinctively turned to the hyperbolic imagery of the great  myths in particular to the image of plague Feuds spread cleaving  the society asunder like a deadly axe blighting its life like the plague3   These are the very symptoms that we have made bold to identify  with the sacrificial crisis or crisis of distinctions The Kaingang seem  to have abandoned all their old mythology in favor of stories of actual  acts of revenge When discussing internecine murders they seem to  be fitting together the pans of a machine the intricate workings of  which they know precisely Their absorbed interest in the history of  their own destruction has impressed on their minds with flawless clar ity the multitudinous crossworkings of feuds4   Although the Kaingang blood feuds represent the decadence of a  system that once enjoyed relative stability the feuds still retain some  remnant of their original sacrificial nature They constitute in fact  a more forceful more violentand therefore less effectiveeffort to  keep a grip on the good violence with all its protective and con  2 Jules Henry Jungle People New York 1964  3 Ibid p 50  4 Ibid p 51     The Sacrificial Crisis 53   straining powers Indeed the bad violence does not yet penetrate the  defenses of those Indians who are said to travel together that is go  out together on hunting expeditions However this group is always  small in number and the relative peace that reigns within it is in sharp  contrast to the violence that rages triumphantly outsidebetween the  different groups   Within the group there is a spirit of conciliation The most inflam matory challenges pass unacknowledged adultery which provokes an  instant and bloody reprisal among members of rival groups is openly  tolerated As long as violence does not cross a certain threshold of  intensitv it remains sacrificial and defines an inner circle of nonvio lence essential to the accomplishment of basic social functionsthat is  to the survival of the society Nonetheless the moment arrives when  the inner group is contaminated As soon as they are installed on a  reservation members of a group tend to turn against one another  They can no longer polarize their aggressions against outside enemies  the others the different men5   The chain of killings finally reaches the heart of the individual  group At this point the very basis of the social life of the group is  challenged In the case of the Kaingang outside factorsprimarily the  Brazilian authoritiesintervened assuring the physical survival of the  last remnants of the Kaingang while guaranteeing the extinction of  their culture   In acknowledging the existence of an internal process of self destruction among the Kaingang we are not attempting to diminish or  dismiss the part played by the white man in this tragedy The problem  of Brazilian responsibility would not be resolved even if the new set tlers had refrained from using hired assassins to speed up the process of  destruction Indeed it is worth asking whether the impetus behind the  Kaingang s dismemberment of their culture and the inexorable charac ter of their selfdestruction were not ultimately due to the pressure of  a foreign culture Even if this were the case cyclical violence still  presents a threat to any society whether or not it is under pressure  from a foreign culture or from any other external interference The  process is basically internal   Such is Henrys conclusion after contemplating the terrible plight of  the Kaingang He uses the phrase social suicide and we must admit  that the potentiality for such selfdestruction always exists In the  course of history a number of communities doubtless succumbed to   5 The Kaingang use one and the same term to refer to 1 differences of all  kinds 2 men of rival

the Sacred   their own violent impulses and disappeared without a trace Even if we  have certain reservations about his interpretation of the case under  discussion Henrys conclusions have direct pertinence to numberless  groups of human beings whose histories remain unknown This  group excellently suited in their physical and psychological endow ments to cope with the rigors of their natural environment were yet  unable to withstand the internal forces that were disrupting their soci ety and having no culturally standardized devices to deal with them  were committing social suicide6   The fear generated by the killorbekilled syndrome the tendency  to anticipate violence by lashing out first akin to our contemporary  concept of preventive war cannot be explained in purely psycho logical terms The notion of a sacrificial crisis is designed to dissipate  the psychological illusion even in those instances when Henry bor rows the language of psychology it is clear that he does not share the  illusion In a universe both deprived of any transcendental code of  justice and exposed to violence everybody has reason to fear the  worst The difference between a projection of ones own paranoia and  an objective evaluation of circumstances has been worn away7   Once that crucial distinction has vanished both psychology and  sociology falter The professional observer who distributes good or  bad marks to individuals and cultures on the basis of their normality  and abnormality is obliged to make his observations from the partic ular perspective of someone who does not run the risk of being killed  Psychologists and other social scientists ordinarily suppose a peaceable  substructure for their subjects indeed they tend to take this pacific  quality for granted Yet nothing in their mode of reasoning which  they like to regard as radically enlightened solidly based and free of  idealistic nonsense justifies such an assumptionas Henrys study  makes clear With a single murder the murderer enters a locked  system He must kill and kill again he must plan whole massacres lest a  single survivor remain to avenge his kin8   Henry encountered some particularly bloodthirsty specimens among  the Kaingang but he also fell in with individual members of the tribe   6 Henry Jungle People p 7  7 When Yakwa says to me My cousin wants to kill me I know he wants to   kill his cousin who slaughtered his pigs for rooting up his corn and when he  says Eduardo the Agent is angry with me I realize that he is angry with the  Agent for not having given him a shirt Yakwas state of mind is a pale reflection  of the Kaingang habit of projecting their own hate and fear into the minds of  those whom they hate and fear Yet one cannot always be sure that it is just a  projection for in these feuds currents of danger may radiate from any number  of points of conflict and there is often good and sufficient cause for any fear  ibid p 54   8 Ibid p 53     The

the grip of a natural law  vhose processes once started can never be stayed9    B   ALTHOUGH THEY APPROACHED THE SUB ect more obliquely the Greek tragedians were concerned like Jules  rlenry with the destruction of a cultural order The violent reci rocity that engulfs their characters is a manifestation of this de tractive process Our own concern with sacrificial matters shows the  vital role the ritualistic crisisthe abolition of all distinctionsplays in  the formation of tragedy In turn a study of tragedy can clarify the  lature of this crisis and those aspects of primitive religion that are  inseparably linked to it For in the final analysis the sole purpose of  religion is to prevent the recurrence of reciprocal violence   I am inclined then to assert that tragedy opens a royal way to the  great dilemmas of religious ethnology Such a stand will no doubt elicit  the scorn of scientific researchers as well as fervent Hellenophiles  from the defenders of traditional humanism to the disciples of  Nietzsche and Heidegger The scientifically inclined have a tendency  to regard literary folk as dubious company whose society grows in creasingly dangerous as their own efforts remain obstinately theoreti cal As for the Hellenophiles they are quick to see blasphemy in any  parallel drawn between classical Greece and primitive societies   It is essential to make it clear once and for all that to draw on tragic  literature does not mean to relinquish scholarly standards of research  nor does it constitute a purely esthetic approach to the subject At  the same time we must manage to appease the men of letters who  tremble at the thought of applying scientific methods of any kind to  literature convinced as they are that such methods can only lead to  facile reductionism of the works of art to sterile analyses that dis regard the spirit of the literature The conflict between the two cul tures science and literature rests on a common failure a negative  complicity shared by literary critics and religious specialists Neither  group perceives the underlying principle on which their objects are  based The tragedians seem to have labored in vain to make this prin ciple manifest They never achieve more than partial success and their  efforts are perpetually undone by the differentiations imposed on their  work by literary critics and social scientists   Ethnologists are not unaware that ritual impurity is linked to the  dissolution of distinctions between individuals and institutions10 How  Ibid  1 0 Cf Mary Douglas Purity and Danger London 1966     56 Violence and the Sacred   ever they fail to recognize the dangers inherent in this dissolution  As we have noted the modern mind has difficulty conceiving of vio lence in terms of a loss of distinctions or of a loss of distinctions in  terms of violence Tragedy can help to resolve this difficulty if we  agree to view the plays from a radical perspective Tragic drama ad dresses itself to a burning issuein fact to the burning issue The issue  is never directly alluded to in the plays and for good reason since it  has to do with the dissolution by reciprocal violence of those very  values and distinctions around which the conflict of the plays sup posedly revolves Because this subject is tabooand even more than  taboo almost unspeakable in the language devoted to distinctions  literary critics proceed to obscure with their own meticulously differ entiated categories the relative lack of difference between antagonists  that characterizes a tragic confrontation in classical drama   The primitive mind in contrast has no difficulty imagining an affili ation between violence and nondifferentiation and indeed is often  obsessed by the possible consequences of such a union Natural differ ences are conceived in terms of cultural differences and vice versa  Where we would view the loss of a distinctive quality as a wholly  natural phenomenon having no bearing on human relationships the  primitive man might well view this occurrence with deep dread Be cause there is no real difference between the various modes of differen tiation there is in consequence no difference between the manner in  which things fail to differ the disappearance of natural differences can  thus bring to mind the dissolution of regulations pertaining to the  individuals proper place in societythat is can instigate a sacrificial  crisis   Once we have grasped this fact certain religious phenomena never  explained by traditional approaches suddenly become intelligible A  brief glance at one of the more spectacular of these phenomena will I  think serve to demonstrate the usefulness of applying the tragic tradi tion to religious ethnology   In some primitive societies twins inspire a particular terror It is not  unusual for one of the twins and often both to be put to death The  origin of this terror has long puzzled ethnologists   Today the enigma is presented as a problem of classification Two  individuals suddenly appear where only one had been expected in  those societies that permit them to survive twins often display a single  social personality The problem of classification as defined by struc turalism does not justify the death of the twins The reasons that  prompt men to do away with certain of their children are undoubtedly  bad reasons but they are not frivolous ones Culture is not merely a     The Sacrificial Crisis 51   jigsaw puzzle where the extra pieces are discarded once the picture has  been completed If the problem of classification becomes crucial that  is because its implications are crucial   Twins invariably share a cultural identity and they often have a  striking physical resemblance to each other Wherever differences are  lacking violence threatens Between the biological twins and the socio logical twins there arises a confusion that grows more troubled as the  question of differences reaches a crisis It is only natural that twins  should awaken fear for they are harbingers of indiscriminate violence  the greatest menace to primitive societies As soon as the twins of  violence appear they multiply prodigiously by scissiparity as it were  and produce a sacrificial crisis It is essential to prevent the spread of  this highly contagious disease When faced with biological twins the  normal reaction of the culture is simply to avoid contagion The way  primitive societies attempt to accomplish this offers a graphic demon stration of the kind of danger they associate with twins In societies  where their very existence is considered dangerous the infants are  exposed that is abandoned outside the community under conditions  that make their death inevitable Any act of direct physical violence  against the anathema is scrupulously avoided Any such act would only  serve to entrap the perpetrators in a vicious circle of violencethe  trap bad violence sets for the community and baits with the birth of  twins   An inventory of the customs prescriptions and interdictions relat ing to twins in those societies where they are regarded with dread  reveals one common concern the fear of pollution The divergences  from one culture to the next are easily explained in terms of the  religious attitudes denned above which pertain to the strictly em piricalthat is terrorstrickencharacter of the precautions taken  against bad violence In the case of twins the precautions are mis directed nevertheless they become quite intelligible once we recog nize the terror that inspires them Although the menace is somewhat  differently perceived from society to society it is fundamentally the  same everywhere and a challenge with which all religious institutions  are obliged to cope   The Nyakyusa maintain that the parents of twins are contaminated  by bad violence and there is a certain logic about that notion since  the parents are after all responsible for engendering the twins In  reference to the twins the parents are designated by a term that is  applied to all threatening individuals all monstrous or terrifying crea tures In order to prevent the spread of pollution the parents are re    5 Violence and the Sacred   quired to isolate themselves and submit to rites of purification only  then are they allowed to rejoin the community11   It is not unreasonable to believe that the relatives and close friends of  the twins parents as well as their immediate neighbors are those most  directly exposed to the infection Bad violence is by definition a  force that works on various levelsphysical familial socialand  spreads from one to the other   Twins are impure in the same way that a warrior steeped in carnage  is impure or an incestuous couple or a menstruating woman All  forms of violence lead back to violence We overlook this fact because  the primitive concept of a link between the loss of distinctions and  violence is strange to us but we need only consider the calamities  primitive people associate with twins to perceive the logic of this  concept Deadly epidemics can result from contact with twins as can  mysterious illnesses that cause sterility in women and animals Even  more significant to us is the role of twins in provoking discord among  neighbors a fatal collapse of ritual the transgression of interdictions  in short their part in instigating a sacrificial crisis   As we have seen the sacred embraces all those forces that threaten  to harm man or trouble his peace Natural forces and sickness are not  distinguished from the threat of a violent disintegration of the com munity Although manmade violence plays a dominant role in the  dialectics of the sacred and is never completely omitted from the warn ings issued by religion it tends to be relegated to the background and  treated as if it emanated from outside man One might say that it has  been deliberately hidden away almost out of sight behind forces that  are genuinely exterior to man   Behind the image of twins lurks the baleful aspect of the sacred  perceived as a disparate but formidably unified force The sacrificial  crisis can be viewed as a general offensive of violence directed against  the community and there is reason to fear that the birth of twins  might herald this crisis   In the primitive societies where twins are not killed they often enjoy  a privileged position This reversal corresponds to the attitudes we  have noted in regard to menstrual blood Any phenomenon linked to  impure violence is capable of being inverted and rendered beneficent  but this can take place only within the immutable and rigorous frame work of ritual practice The purifying and pacifying aspects of vio lence take precedence over its destructive aspects The apparition of  twins then if properly handled may in certain societies be seen to  presage good events not bad ones   11 Monica Wilson Rituals of Kinship among the Nyakyusa Oxford 1957     The Sacrificial Crisis 59   f IF THE STATEMENTS ABOVE ARE VALID  two brothers need not be twins for their resemblances to arouse anx iety We can assume almost a priori that in some societies the mere  fact of familial similarity is cause for alarm The verification of such  a hypothesis would I believe confirm the inadequacy of previous  theories regarding twins If the twin phobia can be extended to other  members of the family it can no longer be explained solely in terms of  a problem of classification Twins could no longer be said to cause  alarm because two individuals had turned up where only one was  expected their physical resemblance would nowT be perceived as the  disruptive factor   At this point we may well wonder how something so commonplace  as the resemblance between siblings can be officially proscribed with out causing enormous inconvenience not to say total chaos After all a  community cannot categorize a majority of its inhabitants as proba tionary criminals without creating an intolerable situation Neverthe less the phobia of resemblance is a fact Malinowskis The father in  Primitive Psychology offers formal proof The study demonstrates  how the phobia can perpetuate itself without disastrous consequences  The ingenuity of man or rather of his cultural systems copes with the  problem by categorically denying the existence of the dreaded phe nomenon or even its possibility   In a matrilineal society as in the Trobriands where all maternal relatives  are considered to be of the same body and the father to be a stran ger we would naturally expect and have no doubt that the facial and  bodily similarity would be traced to the mothers family alone The  contrary is the case and this is affirmed with an extremely strong social  emphasis Not only is it a household dogma so to speak that a child  never resembles its mother any of its brothers or sisters or any of its  maternal kinsmen but it is extremely bad form and a great offence to  hint at any such similarity      I was introduced to this rule of savoir vivre in the usual way by making  a faux pas One of my bodyguards in Omarakana named Moradeda was  endowed with a peculiar cast of features which had struck me at first  sight    One day I was struck by the appearance of an exact counter part to Moradeda and asked his name and whereabouts When I was  told that he was my friends elder brother living in a distant village 1  exclaimed Ah truly I asked about you because your face is alike  alike to that of Moradeda There came such a hush over all the assembly  that 1 noticed it at once The man turned round and left us while part of  the company present after looking away in a manner halfembarrassed  halfoffended soon dispersed I was then told by my confidential in formants that I had committed a breach of custom that I had perpetrated     60 Violence and the Sacred   what is called taputaki migila a technical expression referring only to  this act which might be translated ltodefilebyconiparingtoakins manhisface What astonished me in this discussion was that in spite  of the striking resemblance between the two brothers my informants  refused to admit it In fact they treated the question as if no one could  possibly ever resemble his brother or for the matter of that any mater nal kinsman I made my informants quite angry and displeased with me  by arguing the point   This incident taught me never to hint at such a resemblance in the  presence of the people concerned But I thrashed the matter out well  with many natives in subsequent general conversations I found that  every one in the Trobriands will in the teeth of all the evidence deny  stoutly that similarity can exist between matrilineal kinsmen You simply  irritate and insult a Trobriander if you point to striking instances exactly  as you irritate your nextdoor neighbor in our own society if you bring  before him a glaring truth which contradicts some of his cherished  opinions political religious or moral or which is still worse runs  counter to his personal interests1  Negation here serves as affirmation There would be nothing unto ward in mentioning resemblances if they were not a matter of great  importance To accuse two close relatives of resembling one another is  to assert that they are a menace to the community the carriers of an  infectious disease Malinowski tells us further that the accusation is a  traditional form of insult among the Trobriands the most wounding at  their disposal His account inspires confidence precisely because he  presents the phenomenon as a complete enigma proposing no interpre tation of his own   On the other hand the Trobriands not only tolerate references to  the resemblance between fathers and children but virtually demand its  acknowledgment This society formally denies the fathers role in the  reproductive process between father and children then no parental  link is said to exist   Malinowskis description demonstrates that a paternal resemblance is  perceived by the Trobriands paradoxically enough in terms of differ ences It is the father who serves to differentiate the children from one  another He is literally the bearer of a difference among whose charac teristics we recognize the phallic element so dear to psychoanalysts  Because the father sleeps with the mother because he is so often near  her he is said to mold the face of the child Malinowski informs us  that the word kulicoagulate mold leave an impression  recurred constantly in the discussions of resemblances The father  evidently represents

their mother and from one  another That explains why the children resemble him and why a  resemblance to the father common to all children does not imply a  resemblance of one child to another It was often pointed out to me  how strongly one or the other of the sons of Touluwa chief of  Omarakana resembled his father   Whenever I pointed out that this  similarity to the father implied similarity among each other such a  heresy was indignantly repudiated13   At this point it seems appropriate to juxtapose the basic mythical  theme of enemy brothers with the phobia concerning twins and other  fraternal resemblances Clyde Kluckhohn asserts that the most com mon of all mythical conflicts is the struggle between brothers which  generally ends in fratricide In some regions of black Africa the myth ical protagonists are brothers born in immediate sequence14 If I  understand this phrase correctly it includes twins but is not strictly  limited to them The continuity between the theme of twins and the  fraternal motif in general is not peculiar to the Trobriand Islands   Even when the brothers are not twins the difference between them  is less than that between all other degrees of relations They share the  same mother father gender in most instances they occupy the same  position in respect to other relatives both close and distant Brothers  seem to have more rights duties and functions in common than other  family members Twins are in a sense reinforced brothers whose final  objective difference that of age has been removed it is virtually im possible to distinguish between them   We instinctively tend to regard the fraternal relationship as an affec tionate one yet the mythological historical and literary examples that  spring to mind tell a different story Cain and Abel Jacob and Esau  Eteocles and Polyneices Romulus and Remus Richard the Lion Hearted and John Lackland The proliferation of enemy brothers in  Greek myth and in dramatic adaptations of myth implies the continual  presence of a sacrificial crisis repeatedly alluded to in the same sym bolic terms The fraternal theme is no less contagious qua theme for  being buried deep in the text than is the malevolent violence that  accompanies it In fact the theme itself is a form of violence   When Polyneices departs from Thebes leaving his brother to take  his turn on the throne he carries the fraternal conflict with him as an  integral part of his being Everywhere he goes he literally draws from  the earth the brother who seems expressly designed to thwart him just    Ibid p 92  14 Clyde

indeed all other  instances of fraternal rivalry   Once our attention has been drawn to the distinctive traits of  fraternal strife we seem to rediscover them recurring singly or in  clusters throughout classical myth and tragedy In addition to true  brothers such as Eteocles and Polyneices we find brothersinlaw  that is quasibrothers like Polyneices and Tydeus Oedipus and  Creon or other close relatives of the same generation like the first  cousins Pentheus and Dionysus Ultimately the insufficient difference  in the family relationships serves to symbolize the dissolution of family  distinctions in other words it desymbolizes Such relationships thus  finally contribute to the symmetry of conflicts that is concealed in  mrth but vigorously proclaimed in tragedy which betrays this hidden  process simply by representing the mythological material on stage   Nothing can be further from the truth than the statement that trag edy lacks universality because it is totally preoccupied with family  distinctions It is the elimination of these distinctions that leads directly  to fraternal strife and to the religious phobia regarding twins The two  themes are essentially the same however there is a shade of difference  between them that deserves our attention   Twins offer a symbolic representation sometimes remarkably elo    The Sacrificial Crisis 63   quent of the symmetrical conflict and identity crisis that characterize  the sacrificial crisis But the resemblance is entirely accidental There is  no real connection between biological and sociological twins twins are  no more predisposed to violence than any other menor at least any  other brothers There is something decidedly arbitrary about the rela tionship between sacrificial crises and the essential quality of twinship  which is not of the same order of arbitrariness as that of the linguistic  sign since the representative element is always present Ultimately the  classic definition of the symbol seems to apply to the correspondence  between twins and the sacrificial crisis   In the case of fraternal strife the representative element becomes  blurred Fraternal relationships normally take form within the frame work of the family where differences no matter how small are read ily recognized and acknowledged In passing from twins to the general  category of brothers we lose something on the level of symbolic rep resentation but gain something on that of social reality in fact the  shift puts our feet securely on the ground Because in most societies  the fraternal relationship implies only a minimum of differences it  obviously constitutes a vulnerable point in a system structured on  differences a point dangerously exposed to the onset of a sacrificial  crisis The fear of twins qua twins is clearly mythic and has little basis  in reality but one can hardly say the same for the thematic concern  with fraternal rivalry It is not only in myths that brothers are simul taneously drawn together and driven apart by something they both  ardently desire and which they will not or cannot sharea throne a  woman or in more general terms a paternal heritage   Rival brothers unlike twins straddle both forms of desymboliza tion the purely symbolic and the concrete varietythe variety that  constitutes the true sacrificial crisis In some African monarchies the  death of the king precipitates a struggle for the succession and trans forms the kings sons into fraternal enemies It is difficult if not impos sible to determine to what extent this struggle is symbolic a matter of  ritual and to what extent it is a real historical event pregnant with  unforeseen consequences In other words it is hard to know whether  one is dealing with a reallife struggle or with ritual mimicry whose  cathartic effects are believed to ward off the impending crisis it imitates  so faithfully   If we have difficulty grasping what twins or even rival brothers  represent it is because we do not consider their presence a genuine  threat We cannot imagine how the mere appearance of a pair of twins  or rival brothers can convey the entire course of sacrificial crisis how  the pair can epitomize the entire crisis in terms not of formal rhetoric  but of real violence Any violent effacement of differences even if     64 Violence and the Sacred   initially restricted to a single pair of twins reaches out to destroy a  whole society   We cannot be held entirely responsible for our lack of comprehen sion None of the mythological themes can by itself point to the truth  concerning the sacrificial crisis In the case of twins symmetry and  identity are represented in extraordinarily explicit terms nondiffer ence is present in concrete literal form but this form is itself so  exceptional as to constitute a new difference Thus the representation  of nondifference ultimately becomes the very exemplar of difference a  classic monstrosity that plays a vital role in sacred ritual   In the case of enemy brothers the domestic context in which they  operate brings us back into contact with reality we are no longer  dealing with outlandish phenomena that provoke either amusement or  dread But the very concreteness of the conflict tends to efface its  symbolic significance to lend it the character of a real historical event  With enemy brothers as with twins the sign cannot fail to betray the  thing signified because that thing is the destruction of all significa tion It is violent reciprocity on the rampage everywhere that truly  destroys differences yet this process can never be fully signified Ei ther a degree of difference survives and we remain within the frame work of a cultural order surrounded by meanings that ought to have  been wiped out Or perhaps all differences have indeed been effaced  but the nondifference immediately appears as a new and outlandish  difference a monstrosity such as twins for example   Being made up of differences language finds it almost impossible to  express undifferentiation directly Whatever it may say on the subject  language invariably says at once too much and too little even in such  concise statements as Each thing meetsIn mere oppugnancy or  sound and furySignifying nothing   No matter how diligently language attempts to catch hold of it the  reality of the sacrificial crisis invariably slips through its grasp It in vites anecdotal history on the one hand and on the other a visitation  of monsters and grotesques Mythology succumbs to the latter trag edy is constantly threatened by the former   Monstrosities recur throughout mythology From this we can only  conclude that myths make constant reference to the sacrificial crisis  but do so only in order to disguise the issue Myths are the retrospec tive transfiguration of sacrificial crises the reinterpretation of these  crises in the light of the cultural order that has arisen from them   The traces of sacrificial crisis are less distinct in myth than in trag edy Or rather tragedy is by its very nature a partial deciphering of  mythological motifs The poet brings the sacrificial crisis back to life  he pieces together the scattered fragments of reciprocity and balances     The Sacrificial Crisis 65   elements thrown out of kilter in the process of being mythologized  He whistles up a storm of violent reciprocity and differences are  swept away in this storm just as they were previously dissolved in the  real crisis that must have generated the mythological transfiguration   Tragedy envelops all human relationships in a single tragic antag onism It does not differentiate between the fraternal conflict of  Eteocles and Polyneices the fatherson conflict of Alcestis or Oedipus  the King the conflict between men who share no ancestral ties such as  Oedipus and Tiresias The rivalry of the two prophets is indistinguish able from the rivalry between brothers Tragedy tends to restore vio lence to mythological themes It in part fulfills the dire forebodings  primitive men experience at the sight of twins It spreads the pollution  abroad and multiplies the mirror images of violence   Tragedy has a particular affinity for myth but that does not mean it  takes the same course The term desymbolism is more appropriate to  tragedy than is symbolism It is because most of the symbols of the  sacrificial crisisin particular the symbol of the enemy brotherlend  themselves so readily to both the tragic and the ritual situations that  tragedy has been able to operate at least to some extent within and  also contrary to mythological patterns I have already noted this dual  aspect of symbolic reference in connection with the monarchic suc cession in certain African states it is virtually impossible to determine  whether the fraternal rivalry that occurs in that connection is ritualis tic or part of the tragedy of history   Symbolized reality becomes paradoxically the loss of all symbolism  the loss of differences is necessarily betrayed by the differentiated  expression of language The process is a peculiar one utterly foreign to  our usual notions of symbolism Only a close reading of tragedy a  radically symmetrical reading will help us to understand the phe nomenon to penetrate to the source of tragic inspiration If the tragic  poet touches upon the violent reciprocity underlying all myths it is  because he perceives these myths in a context of weakening distinc tions and growing violence His work is inseparable then from a new  sacrificial crisis the one referred to at the opening of this chapter   To know violence is to experience it Tragedy is therefore direcdy  linked to violence it is a child of the sacrificial crisis The relationship  between tragedy and myth as it is now taking shape can perhaps be  understood more easily if we consider an analogous relationship that  of the Old Testament prophets to the Pentateuchal texts they cite as  exemplars For example we find in Jeremiah 935   Beware a brother  for every brother plays the role of Jacob     66 Violence and the Sacred   and every friend spreads scandal  One deceives the other     Fraud upon fraud deceit upon deceit   The concept of enemy brothers previously mentioned in connection  with Jacob is precisely the same as the concept governing Euripides  version of the EteoclesPolyneices story It is the symmetry of the  conflict that defines the fraternal relationship and this symmetry orig inally limited to a few tragic heroes now reaches out to include the  entire community It loses its particularized quality and acquires a  predominantly social meaning The allusion to Jacob is subordinated  to the main design which is the description of the sacrificial crisis  violence engulfs the whole society all its members confronting one  another as enemy brothers Specific stylistic effects underline the  symmetry and mirror the violent reciprocity One deceives the other     Fraud upon fraud deceit upon deceit   The books of the Old Testament are rooted in sacrificial crises each  distinct from the other and separated by long intervals of time but  analogous in at least some respects The earlier crises are reinterpreted  in the light of the later ones And the experience of previous crises is of  great value in coping with subsequent ones Jeremiahs treatment of  the historical figure of Jacob seems to bear this out Contact has been  established between the time of Genesis and the crisis of the sixth  century as a result light is shed on both eras Like tragedy the  prophetic act constitutes a return to violent reciprocity so it too  levels all mythological distinctions and does so even more effectively  than tragedy However this leads us to a subject that deserves separate  consideration a subject I will turn to in another work   Although the source of inspiration emerges more dimly and indi rectly in tragedy than in biblical examples the pattern is the same The  passage quoted above might well be taken for a fragment of a tragic  drama drawn from the Book of Genesisa tragedy of enemy brothers  perhaps Jacob and Esau   Tragic and prophetic inspiration do not draw strength from histori cal or philological sources but from a direct intuitive grasp of the role  played by violence in the cultural order and in disorder as well in  mythology and in the sacrificial crisis England in the throes of reli gious upheaval provided Shakespeare with such an inspiration for his  Troilus and Cressida There is no reason to believe that advances in  scholarship will by the process of continuous enrichment so dear to  the positivist cause increase our understanding of the great tragedies  for however real and valuable this process may be it fails to touch on  the true tragic spirit This spirit never widespread even in periods     The Sacrificial Crisis 61   of crisis vanishes without a trace during periods of cultural stability  At a given moment the violent effacement of distinctions ceases and   the process begins to reverse itself giving way to mythical elaboration  Mythical elaboration gives way in turn to the inverse operation of  tragic inspiration What sets off these metamorphoses What mech anism governs the shift from cultural order to disorder This is the  question that concerns us and this question elicits yet another which  touches on the final stages of the sacrificial crisis Once violence has  penetrated a community it engages in an orgy of selfpropagation  There appears to be no way of bringing the reprisals to a halt before  the community has been annihilated   If there are really such events as sacrificial crises some son of brak ing mechanism an automatic control that goes into effect before  everything is destroyed must be built into them In the final stages of a  sacrificial crisis the very viability of human society is put in question  Our task is to discover what these final stages involve and what makes  them possible It is likely that they must serve as a point of departure  for both ritual and myth Everything we can learn about this phase of  the crisis then will enhance our knowledge of the nature of ritual and  myth   To find an answer to these questions let us address ourselves to one  myth in particular the story of Oedipus Our previous investigations  gave us reason to believe that the most useful approach lay by way of  tragedy We will turn our attention therefore to Sophocles Oedipus  the King     l  Chapter Three   Oedipus and the  Surrogate Victim   C  f 5 s y l  SOPHOCLES IS OFTEN PRAISED for having created       in Oedipus a highly individualized character Here it is   said is a hero who is very much his own man And what sort of a man  is he It is traditional to note both his generosity and his impulsive ness At the opening of the play we admire his noble serenity as  he dedicates himself to solving the mystery of the plague that afflicts his  subjects But the least obstacle delay or provocation suffices to upset  his poise The diagnosis seems clear Oedipus is prone to fits of anger  The king himself acknowledges this fault presenting it so it seems as  that unique but fatal flaw without which a hero cannot attain tragic  stature   The noble serenity is in evidence first the fits of anger follow  Tiresias provokes the initial outburst Creon the second In Oedipuss  own account of his past life he informs us that he has frequently  succumbed to this flaw He admits to overreacting to hasty phrases  heedlessly uttered a drinking companion in Corinth had blurted out  some remark casting doubt on Oedipuss parentage Oedipus reacted  with an outburst of anger that precipitated his departure from the city  And it was in a fit of anger that he struck down at the crossroads an  old man who blocked his wav   The description of his character seems unambiguous and anger is  surely as good a word as any to use in describing the personal reactions  of the hero However we cannot help asking ourselves whether these  tantrums really serve to distinguish Oedipus from the other characters  In other words can they be said to perform the differential function  upon which the whole concept of character is based   If we look closely at the myth we notice that anger crops up  everywhere It was a kind of suppressed anger that incited Oedipuss  companion at Corinth to cast doubt on the heros parentage At the  fateful crossroads it was anger that goaded Laius initially to raise a  hand against his son It was yet an earlier act of anger preceding any   6ft     Oedipus and the Surrogate Victim 69   tctions by Oedipus that prompted the fathers decision to do away  tvith his infant son   It is clear that Oedipus has no monopoly on anger in the play  Whatever the authors intentions there would be no tragic debate if  the other protagonists did not become angry in turn It is true that  these outbursts only occur after a certain delay and it is tempting to  regard them as justified reprisals warranted by Oedipuss inex cusable and provoking displays of temper But we have seen that  Oedipuss anger is never without antecedents it is always preceded and  determined by an initial outburst Even that initial anger is never truly  the original anger In the domain of impure violence any search for  origins leads back to myth One cannot engage in a search of this sort  much less place any credence in the ultimate success of such a search  without destroying violent reciprocity without in short having re course to those very mythological distinctions from which tragedy is  striving to extricate itself   Tiresias and Creon keep their tempers at the outset their initial  serenity is matched by Oedipuss own serenity in the first episode In  fact we have to do with an alternation of calm and anger The only  distinction between Oedipus and his adversaries is that Oedipus ini tiates the contest triggering the tragic plot He thus has a certain head  start on the others But though the action does not occur simultane ously its symmetry is absolute Each protagonist in turn occupies the  same position in regard to the same object This object is none other  than the particular tragic conflict whose association with the plague we  have already noted and will explore in more detail further on At first  each of the protagonists believes that he can quell the violence at the  end each succumbs to it All are drawn unwittingly into the structure  of violent reciprocitywhich they always think they are outside of  because they all initially come from the outside and mistake this posi tional and temporary advantage for a permanent and fundamental  superiority   The three protagonists believe themselves to be above the battle  After all Oedipus is not from Thebes Creon is not king and Tiresias  is soaring aloft high amid the clouds Creon returns from Thebes  armed with the latest oracle Oedipus and especially Tiresias bring to  bear their formidable divinatory skills In this capacity7 they possess all  the prestige of the modern expert whose services are reserved for  exceptionally difficult cases Each believes himself to be an impartial  observer detached from the action each wants to assume the role of  arbitrator and judge The solemnity of the three sages rapidly gives  way to fury however when each sees his prestige challengedif only  by the silence of the other two     10 Violence and the Sacred   The force exerted by the three men in the struggle corresponds to  each mans illusion of superiority his hubris In other words nobody  possesses sophrosyne and on that level too the differences among  them are illusory or quickly effaced The passage from calm to anger is  in each case rendered inevitable It seems arbitrary therefore to rele gate to Oedipus as a distinctive character trait an attribute shared  equally by allespecially if this common attribute is drawn from the  tragic context of the play and provides a more coherent interpretation  than the psychological approach allows   Far from bringing differences into sharp relief the plunge into op position reduces the protagonists to a uniform condition of violence  they are engulfed in the same storm of passion A single glance at an  Oedipus drunk with violence and eager to engage him in dialogue  convinces TLresias that he has been led astray But the knowledge  comes too late Alas alas how terrible to know the truth when this  knowledge serves for naught I was not totally ignorant of this truth  but had thrust it from mv mind Otherwise I would not have come   Tragedy is not a matter of differing opinions The symmetrical qual ity of the conflict determines the limits of the tragic inspiration And  in asserting that there is no difference between the antagonists in a  tragedy we are saying that ultimately there is no difference between  the true and the false prophet The statement seems ridiculous  even unthinkable at first glance For does not Tiresias proclaim the  truth about Oedipus at the outset while Oedipus is vilifying Tiresias  with odious calumnies   With Tiresiass entrance our quest for symmetry receives a sharp  rebuff As soon as it catches sight of this stately personage the chorus  exclaims   Here approaches the most inspired of prophets  he alone who is the keeper of hidden truth   Clearly we are dealing here with the infallible and omniscient prophet  the sole possessor of an indubitable verity long ripened in the keeping  For once it seems difference has triumphed However some lines  further on this difference is eclipsed we encounter a resurgence of  reciprocity more explicit than ever Tiresias himself rejects the tradi tional interpretation of his role the very one proposed by the chorus  In reply to Oedipus who has questioned him derisively on the origins  of his prophetic gifts Tiresias denies that he possesses any truth except  the truth conferred on him by Oedipus himself   Oedipus Who taught you truth Was it part of your training as a  prophet   Tiresias You taught me in forcing me to speak against my will     Oedipus and the Surrogate Victim 11   If we take Tiresiass reply literally the terrible charges of patricide  and incest that he has just leveled at Oedipus did not stem from any  supernatural source of information The accusation is simply an act of  reprisal arising from the hostile exchange of a tragic debate Oedipus  unintentionally initiates the process by forcing Tiresias to speak He  accuses Tiresias of having had a part in the murder of Laius he prods  Tiresias into reprisal into hurling the accusation back at him   The only difference between the initial accusation and the counter charge is the paradoxical quality of the latter This quality which  could well be a weakness in fact becomes an added strength Tiresias  not content to answer Oedipuss You are guilty by echoing You  are guilty underlines what from his point of view is the most scanda lous aspect of the accusationa guilty man is leveling the charge  You pronounce me guilty and think yourself innocent whereas O  wondrous world the guilty one is you The criminal you pursue is  none other than Oedipus   To accuse the other of Laiuss murder is to attribute to him sole  responsibility for the sacrificial crisis but as we have seen everybody  shares equal responsibility because everybody participates in the de struction of a cultural order The blows exchanged by enemy brothers  may not always land on their mark but every one of them deals a  staggering blow to the institutions of monarchy and religion Each  party progresses rapidly in uncovering the truth about the other  without ever recognizing the truth about himself   Each sees in the other the usurper of a legitimacy that he thinks he is  defending but that he is in fact undermining Anything one may affirm  or deny about either of the adversaries seems instantly applicable to the  other Reciprocity is busy aiding each party in his own destruction  The tragic debate is clearly the verbal equivalent of the fight between  such enemy brothers as Eteocles and Polyneices   In a series of replies Tiresias warns Oedipus of the purely reciprocal  nature of the approaching tragedy that is of the blows that each wrill  inflict on the other As far as I know nobody has proposed a satisfac tory interpretation of these lines The very rhythm of the phrases  their symmetrical effects anticipate and provoke the tragic debate We  see here violent reciprocity in action canceling all distinctions be tween the two men   Enough Let me go home now If you follow my advice we will both  find it easier to bear our separate destinies      Ah I see that your own words fall wide of the mark and I fear to have  no better success with mine      I do not want to inflict pain on either of us        12 Violence and the Sacred   You reproach me for my stubbornness but refuse to see the stubbornness  that dwells within vou and therefore out of stubbornness cast blame on   The violent elimination of differences between the antagonists their  total identity suddenly illuminates these responses which give perfect  expression to the true nature of tragic relationships The fact that these  responses even today still seem obscure confirms our lack of under standing It should be said however that there is good reason for this  lack one cannot persevere in bringing to light the symmetrical quality  of tragedyas we are now doingwithout contradicting the funda mental implications of the myth   If the myth does not explicitly set forth the problem of differences  it nonetheless manages to resolve the problem in a matter both brutal  and categorical The solution involves patricide and incest In the  mythical version of the story the issue of reciprocitythe identity of  Oedipus with the othersnever arises One can assert with lotal con viction that Oedipus is unique in at least one respect he alone is guilty  of patricide and incest He is presented as a monstrous exception to the  general run of mankind he resembles nobody and nobody resembles  him   The tragedians version of the Oedipus story differs radically from  the myth indeed it is impossible to do justice to this presentation  without abandoning the myth altogether Interpreters of Sophocles  play invariably devise compromises that conceal the underlying con tradiction between the tragedy and the myth I shall not have recourse  to these venerable compromises nor try to invent new ones My quest  leads elsewhere I intend to trace the tragic vein to its source if only to  see where it leads I hope this exploration will yield something of value  about the genesis of the myth   First let us return to the issues of patricide and incest and attempt to  determine whether these crimes can be attributed to one particular  protagonist and to one alone As we have seen the tragedy transforms  the murder of Laius and the patricide and incest themselves into an  exchange of mutual incriminations Oedipus and Tiresias each attempt  to place the blame for the citys plight on the other the accusations of  patricide and incest are only especially striking contributions to a con ventional exchange of incivilities At this stage of the debate there is no  reason to assume that either party is more guilty of any crime than the  other Both sides seem equally matched neither seems able to gain the  upper hand The myth breaks the deadlock however and does so  unequivocally We must now in the light of our understanding of     Oedipus and the Surrogate Victim 75   tragic reciprocity examine on what basis and under what conditions  the myth succeeds in intervening decisively in the struggle   At this point a strange and wellnigh fantastic thought suggests it self If we eliminate the testimony brought against Oedipus in the  second half of the tragedy then the conclusion of the myth far from  seeming a sudden lightning flash of the truth striking down the guilty  party and illuminating all the mortal participants seems nothing more  than the camouflaged victory of one version of the story7 over the  other the polemical version over its rivalthe communitys formal  acceptance of Tiresiass and Creons version of the story thereafter  held to be the true and universal version the verity behind the myth  itself   At this point the reader may well suspect that 1 harbor some strange  illusions about the historical potential of these texts and about the  information that one may reasonably expect to drawr out of them I  hope that what follows will help to dissipate these fears However  before proceeding I feel obliged to address myself to another type of  objection that the present inquiry7 seems certain to attract   Literary criticism concerns itself with tragedy mythology is outside  its proper bailiwick Students of mythology on the other hand ex clude tragedy from their area of concern and even display on occasion  a hostile attitude toward it   This division of labor harks back to Aristotle who declares in the  Poetics that the competent tragic poet will avoid manipulating the  myths and limit his borrowings from them to certain subjects This  interdict of Aristotle still stands in the way of our confronting the  symmetrical quality of tragedy and the mythical concern with differ ences which protects literature from mythology and also protects  their respective specialists from the subversive consequences that  might result from a confrontation   It is precisely this confrontation I want to emphasize Indeed one  cannot but wonder how attentive readers of Oedipus the King have  managed to overlook it At the climactic moment of the tragic struggle  Sophocles has inserted into his text two replies that seem to pertain  directly to our reading Oedipuss imminent fall has nothing to do with  any heinous sin rather it should be regarded as the outcome of a  tragic encounter in which Oedipus has met defeat Oedipus replies to  the chorus which has pleaded with him to spare Creon What you  are asking if the truth be told is neither more nor less than my death  or exile   The chorus insists that Creon does not deserve punishment he  should be allowed to withdraw in peace Oedipus yields to their re    74 Violence and the Sacred   quest but reluctantly and he reminds the chorus once again of the  true nature of this struggle whose outcome is still unclear To spare an  enemy brother from death or exile is to condemn oneself to death or  exile Well then let him departthough his departure means my  certain death or else my ignominious expulsion from Thebes   Should we follow tradition and attribute such responses to the  tragic illusion In that case the whole play and its wondrous equi librium must also be a figment of this same illusion We will be on safer  ground I believe if we turn our attention from tragic illusion to  tragic vision I cannot help feeling that Sophocles himself is prompting  us to do so   Yet Sophocles himself remains elusive Tragic subversion has its lim its if the playwright challenges the basis of the myth he only dares to  do so in muted and devious fashion He does not want to compromise  his own enterprise or demolish the mythological framework in which  he operates   We are left with no model or guide we are engaged in a cultural  activity that remains undefined and we can have recourse to no known  critical discipline What we are about to do is as novel to tragedy or  literary criticism as it is to psychoanalysis or ethnology   We must return once again to the socalled crimes of the son of  Laius The act of regicide is the exact equivalent visavis the polis of  the act of patricide visavis the family In both cases the criminal  strikes at the most fundamental essential and inviolable distinction  within the group He becomes literally the slayer of distinctions   Patricide represents the establishment of violent reciprocity between  father and son the reduction of the paternal relationship to fraternal  revenge This reciprocity is explicitly indicated in the tragedy as we  have noted Laius displays violence towards Oedipus even before his  son actually attacks him   When it has succeeded in abolishing even the traditional fatherson  relationship violent reciprocity is left in sole command of the battle field Its victory could hardly be more complete for in pitting father  against son it has chosen as the basis of their rivalry an object solemnly  consecrated as belonging to the father and formally forbidden the son  that is the fathers wife and sons mother Incest is also a form of  violence an extreme form and it plays in consequence an extreme role  in the destruction of differences It destroys that other crucial family  distinction that between the mother and her children Between patri cide and incest the violent abolition of all family differences is  achieved The process that links violence to the loss of distinctions will  naturally perceive incest and patricide as its ultimate goals No possibil    Oedipus and the Surrogate Victim 15   ity of difference then remains no aspect of life is immune from the  onslaught of violence1   Patricide and incest will thus be defined in terms of their conse quences Oedipuss monstrosity is contagious it infects first of all those  beings engendered by him The essential task is to separate once more  the two strains of blood whose poisonous blend is now perpetuated by  the natural process of generation Incestuous propagation leads to  formless duplications sinister repetitions a dark mixture of unnamable  things In short the incestuous creature exposes the community to the  same danger as do twins These are indeed the manifestations real and  transfigured of the sacrificial crisis always referred to by primitive  societies in connection with incest Indeed the mothers of twins are  often suspected of having conceived their children in incestuous  fashion   Sophocles attributes Oedipuss incest to the influence of the god  Hymen who after all is directly implicated in the affair as the god of  matrimonial laws and the regulator of family distinctions   Hymen O Hymen to whom I owe my birth and who having engen dered me employed the same seed in the same place to cast upon the  outraged world a monstrous commingling of fathers brothers sons of  brides wives and mothers   In contradistinction to the Ulysses of Shakespeare and his crisis of  Degree the Oedipus myth note that we are not referring here to the  tragedy makes no effort to link patricide and incest to anything else  not even to Laiuss abortive attempt at infanticide They are presented  as separate events so anomalous that it is impossible to think of them as  part of the tumult that rages around them involving elements of con flicting symmetry The dual disasters incest and patricide seem to be   1 In an essay entitled Ambiguite et renversement sur la structure enigmatique  TOedtpe Roi JeanPierre Vernant has apdy defined this loss of cultural differ ence Patricide and incest he writes constitute    a direct violation of the  game of draughts in which each piece stands in relation to the others at a  specified place on the draught board of the city In effect the results of the two  crimes are always expressed in terms of lost distinctions The equalization of  Oedipus and his sons is expressed in a series of brutal images the father has  sown his children in the same place where he himself was sown Jocasta is a wife  not wife but mother whose furrows have yielded a double harvest of father  and children she has been sown and from these same furrows these equal  furrows he has obtained his children But it is left to Tiresias to endow this talk  of equality with its true tragic weight when he addressed Oedipus in the follow ing terms Evils will befall you which will establish an equality between yourself  and your children in Echanges et co7tmiuritcationsy ed Jean Pouillon and  Pierre Maranda The Hague 1970 p 425     16 Violence and the Sacred   divorced from all context and visited on Oedipus alone either by pure  chance or at the bidding of Destiny or some other sacred force   Patricide and incest serve the same purpose here as do twins in many  primitive religions The crimes of Oedipus signify the abolishment of  differences but because the nondifference is attributed to a particular  individual it is transformed into a new distinction signifying the mon strosity of Oedipuss situation The nondifference became the respon sibility not of society at large but of a single individual   Patricide and incest thus play the same role in the Oedipus myth as  do the other mythical and ritual motifs considered previously They  serve to conceal the sacrificial crisis far more effectively than they  reveal it To be sure they manage to express both aspects of the crisis  both reciprocity and forced similarities but they do so in a way that  strikes terror into the beholder and suggests that they are the exclusive  responsibility of a particular individual We lose sight of the fact that  this same reciprocity operates among every member of the community  and signifies the existence of a sacrificial crisis   Another thematic device in addition to patricide and incest cloaks  the sacrificial crisis in parallel and inverse fashion the motif of the  plague or epidemic   We have already referred to various epidemics as symbols of the  sacrificial crisis Even if Sophocles had in mind the famous Athenian  plague of 430 BC he clearly did not mean to limit his reference to one  specific microbiotic visitation The epidemic that interrupts all the  vital functions of the city is surelv not unrelated to violence and the      loss of distinctions The oracle itself explains matters it is the infec tious presence of a murderer that has brought on the disaster   The play makes it clear that the infection and the onslaught of  reciprocal violence are one and the same The process by winch the  three protagonists are each in turn tainted with violence corresponds  to the progress of the disease always quick to lay low those who  would contain it Without explicitly declaring the identical nature of  the two strains the text nonetheless calls attention to their parallel  qualities Begging Oedipus and Creon to end their quarrel the chorus  exclaims The sight of this dying country fills me with anguish Must  we now add to our misery the miseries which flow from you   In tragedy and outside it as well plague is a symbol for the sacrifi cial crisis that is it serves the same function as patricide and incest It  seems reasonable to ask why two different symbols are used when one  would do and whether these two symbols really play identical roles   We need only compare the two themesplague and patricideincest  to remark how they differ and what this difference implies Vital  aspects of the sacrificial crisis are apparent in both symbolic presenta    Oedipus and the Surrogate Victim 77   tions but they are differently distributed The plague motif illuminates  but a single aspect the collective character of the disaster its univer sally contagious nature This motif ignores violence and the nondiffer ential character of the crisis With the patricideincest motif on the  other hand violence and nondifference are presented in magnified and  highly concentrated form but limited to a single individual Here it is  the collective element that has been ignored   Both the patricideincest and the plague motifs serve to disguise the  presence of the sacrificial crisis but the disguises are not the same  When viewed separately each appears unrecognizable without form  One complements the other however and when they are brought  together and uniformly applied to all members of the community the  shape and substance of the crisis becomes clear Once again it is impos sible to make any affirmative or negative judgements about the partici pants The responsibihtv for the events is evenly distributed among  all   If the crisis has dropped from sight if universal reciprocity is elim inated it is because of the unequal distribution of the very real parts of  the crisis In fact nothing has been truly abolished nothing added but  everything has been misplaced The whole process of mythical formu lation leads to a transferral of violent undifferentiation from all the  Thebans to the person of Oedipus Oedipus becomes the repository of  all the communitvs ills   In the myth the fearful transgression of a single individual is substi tuted for the universal onslaught of reciprocal violence Oedipus is  responsible for the ills that have befallen his people He has become a  prime example of the human scapegoat   At the conclusion of his drama Sophocles has Oedipus address the  Thebans in the terms best calculated to quell their doubts and fears He  assures them that all the evils abroad in the community are the sole  responsibility of the surrogate victim and that he alone as that victim  must assume the consequences for these ills Believe me you have  nothing more to fear My ills are mine alone no other mortal is fit to  bear them Oedipus is indeed the responsible party so responsible that  he frees the community from all accountability The concept of the  plague is a result of this situation The plague is what remains of the  sacrificial crisis when it has been emptied of all violence It calls to mind  the passivity of the patient in the modern world of medicine Every one is sick Nobody owes anybody anything by way of recompense or  atonementexcept of course Oedipus   If the community is to be freed of all responsibility for its unhappy  condition and the sacrificial crisis converted into a physical disorder a  plague the crisis must first be stripped of its violence Or rather this     18 Violence and the Sacred   violence must be deflected to some individualin this case Oedipus In  the course of the tragic debate all the characters do their utmost to  assist in this process As we have seen the inquest on Laiuss death is in  fact an investigation into the general subject of the sacrificial crisis  and it is clearly a matter of pinning the responsibility for the troubled  state of the community on some individual of framing a reply to the  mythical question par excellence Who initiated the crisis Oedipus  fails to fix the blame on Creon or Tiresias Creon and Tiresias are  successful in their efforts to fix the blame on him The entire investiga tion is a feverish hunt for a scapegoat which finally turns against the  very man who first loosed the hounds   Having oscillated freely among the three protagonists the full bur den of guilt finally settles on one It might very well have settled on  another or on none What is the mysterious mechanism that deter mines how the guilt shall fall   The attribution of guilt that henceforth passes for true differs in  no way from those attributions that will henceforth be regarded as  false except that in the case of the true guilt no voice is raised to  protest any aspect of the charge A particular version of events suc ceeds in imposing itself it loses its polemical nature in becoming the  acknowledged basis of the myth in becoming the myth itself The  mythical attribution can only be defined as a phenomenon of unanim ity xt the point where two three or hundreds of symmetrical and  inverted accusations meet one alone makes itself heard and the others  fall silent The old pattern of each against another gives way to the  unified antagonism of all against one   How does it happen that the communitys sense of unity destroyed  by the sacrificial crisis is suddenly almost miraculously restored  Here we are in the very midst of the crisis when all the circumstances  seem to militate against any unified course of action It is impossible to  find two men who agree on anything and each member of the com munity seems intent on transferring the collective burden of responsi bility to the shoulders of his enemy brother Chaos reigns No  connecting thread however tenuous links the conflicts antagonisms  and obsessions that beset each individual   Yet at this very moment when all seems lost when the irrational  runs amok amid an infinite diversity of opinions the resolution of the  dilemma is at hand The whole community now hurls itself into the  violent unanimity that is destined to liberate it   What is the source of this mysterious unanimity The antagonists  caught up in the sacrificial crisis invariably believe themselves sepa rated bv insurmountable differences In realitv however these differ ences gradually wear away Everywhere we now encounter the same     Oedipus and the Surrogate Victim 19   desire the same antagonism the same strategiesthe same illusion of  rigid differentiation within a pattern of everexpanding uniformity As  the crisis grows more acute the community members are transformed  into twins matching images of violence I would be tempted to say that they are each doubles of the other   In Romantic literature in the animistic theory of primitive religious  practices and in modern psychiatry the term double is perceived as  essentially unreal a projection of the imagination I mean something  different here Although doubles in my use of the term convey cer tain hallucinatory associations which I shall discuss further on they  are in themselves not at all imaginaryno more than the tragic  symmetry of which they form the ideal expression is imaginary   If violence is a great leveler of men and everybody becomes the  double or twin of his antagonist it seems to follow that all the  doubles are identical and that any one can at any given moment be come the double of all the others that is the sole object of universal  obsession and hatred A single victim can be substituted for all the  potential victims for all the enemy brothers that each member is striv ing to banish from the community he can be substituted in fact for  each and every member of the community Each members hostility  caused by clashing against others becomes converted from an individ ual feeling to a communal force unanimously directed against a single  individual The slightest hint the most groundless accusation can cir culate with vertiginous speed and is transformed into irrefutable proof  The corporate sense of conviction snowballs each member taking  confidence from his neighbor by a rapid process of mimesis The firm  conviction of the group is based on no other evidence than the unshak able unanimity of its own illogic   The universal spread of doubles the complete effacement of dif ferences heightening antagonisms but also making them interchange able is the prerequisite for the establishment of violent unanimity For  order to be reborn disorder must first triumph for myths to achieve  their complete integration they must first suffer total disintegration   Where only shortly before a thousand individual conflicts had raged  unchecked between a thousand enemy brothers there now reappears a  true community united in its hatred for one alone of its number All  the rancors scattered at random among the divergent individuals all  the differing antagonisms now converge on an isolated and unique  figure the surrogate victim   The general direction of the present hypothesis should now be  abundantly clear any community that has fallen prey to violence or  has been stricken by some overwhelming catastrophe hurls itself  blindly into the search for a scapegoat Its members instinctively seek     80 Violence and the Sacred   an immediate and violent cure for the onslaught of unbearable violence  and strive desperately to convince themselves that all their ills are the  fault of a lone individual who can be easily disposed of   Such circumstances bring to mind the forms of violence that break  out spontaneously in countries convulsed by crisis lynchings pogroms  etc It is perhaps worth noting that these forms of collective violence  generally justify themselves by making accusations of an Oedipal vari ety parricide incest infanticide   Such comparisons are of only limited value but they shed some  light They reveal a hidden connection among certain tragedies that at  first glance seem utterly foreign to one another It is impossible to say  whether Sophocles was aware of the full implications of his theme  though to judge from the passages we have cited from Oedipus the  King it is difficult to believe that he shared our ignorance It could  well be that the tragic inspiration was neither more nor less than the  sudden inkling of the origins of certain mythological themes This  view seems to find support in other tragedies besides Oedipus and  other tragedians besides Sophoclesin particular in the work of  Euripides   The heroine of Andromache is Neoptolemuss mistress Hermione is  his wife The two women prime examples of enemy sisters engage in  a tragic debate The humiliated wife accuses her rival of the typical  crimes of parricide and incest those with which Tiresias charged  Oedipus at the same crucial moment of another tragedy   Have you woman no shame at all You do not scruple to sleep with  the son of your husbands murderer Neoptolemuss father Achilles had  killed Hector or to bear his children Such is the way of barbarians the  father sleeps with the daughter the son with the mother the brother  with the sister And they think nothing of killing one another nor does  their law condemn the practice We want no such customs here   The substitution is clear The foreigner Andromache is made to  appear the incarnation of the sacrificial crisis that threatens the com munity She is declared capable of committing precisely those crimes  that figure so predominantly in mythology and that consequently form  the subject of classical tragedy Hermiones ominous final phrase We  want no such customs here already hints at the collective fury and  fear that might be launched against Andromache at Hermiones instiga tion Already the mechanism has been put in motion for the selection  of a surrogate victim   It is difficult to believe that Euripides did not know what he was  doing when he framed these passages that he was unaware of the close  relationship between the genesis of mythology and the collective     Oedipus and the Surrogate Victim 81   mechanism he alludes to here nor can I believe that he was not at tempting to issue a warning to his public to instill a sense of uneasiness  without defining the problem precisely or confronting it directly   We like to believe that we are well acquainted with the mechanisms  of collective violence In fact we know them only in their most degen erate forms as poor imitations of the collective machinery that pro cessed such mythological material as the story of Oedipus In the  following pages violent unanimity will I believe reveal itself as the  fundamental phenomenon of primitive religion although wherever it  plays a crucial role it is completely or almost completely absorbed by  the mythological forms it engenders We perceive only its marginal  and bastardized manifestations which are unproductive as far as myths  and ritual are concerned   It is generally assumed that collective violencein particular the  pitting of all against oneis an aberration in the history of a society a  perversion more or less pathological in nature whose study can hardly  be expected to yield anything of sociological significance Our ration alist bent about which I will have more to say further on leads to an  innocence of outlook that refuses to concede to collective violence  anything more than a limited and fleeting influence a cathartic ac tion similar in its most extreme forms to the catharsis of the sacrificial  ritual However the fact that the Oedipus myth has survived over  several millenia and that modern culture continues to hold it dear  would suggest that the effects of collective violence are greatly under estimated   The mechanism of reciprocal violence can be described as a vicious  circle Once a community enters the circle it is unable to extricate  itself We can define this circle in terms of vengeance and reprisals  and we can offer diverse psychological descriptions of these reactions  As long as a working capital of accumulated hatred and suspicion exists  at the center of the communitv it will continue to increase no matter  what men do Each person prepares himself for the probable aggression  of his neighbors and interprets his neighbors preparations as confirma tion of the latters aggressiveness In more general terms the mimetic  character of violence is so intense that once violence is installed in a  community it cannot burn itself out   To escape from the circle it is first necessary to remove from the  scene all those forms of violence that tend to become selfpropagating  and to spawn new imitative forms   When a community succeeds in convincing itself that one alone ol  its number is responsible for the violent mimesis besetting it when it i  able to view this member as the single polluted enemy who is con taminating the rest and when the citizens are truly unanimous in thi     82 Violence and the Sacred   convictionthen the belief becomes a reality for there will no longer  exist elsewhere in the community a form of violence to be followed or  opposed which is to say imitated and propagated In destroying the  surrogate victim men believe that they are ridding themselves of some  present ill And indeed they are for they are effectively doing away  with those forms of violence that beguile the imagination and provoke  emulation   It may seem absurd to assign any practical purpose to the concept of  the surrogate victim Yet we have only to substitute the word violence  as it is used in these pages for the particular ills or sins that the victim  is supposed to take upon himself to realize that we are indeed dealing  not simply with an illusion and a mystification but with the most  formidable and influential illusion and mystification in the whole range  of human experience one whose consequences are real and manifold   Because modern man clings to the belief that knowledge is in itself a  good thing he grants litde or no importance to a procedure such as  the one involving the surrogate victim that only serves to conceal the  existence of mans violent impulses The optimistic falsification could  well constitute the worst sort of ignorance Indeed the formidable  effectiveness of the process derives from its depriving men of knowl edge knowledge of the violence inherent in themselves with which  they have never come to terms   As Oedipus and Tiresias show us the knowledge of these violent  impulses continues to expand in the course of the sacrificial crisis  However far from restoring peace the knowledge only increases the  antagonists awareness of the others violence thereby serving to in tensify the controversy This baleful knowledge this lucidity that is  only another manifestation of violence is succeeded by an allinclusive  ignorance At a single blow collective violence wipes out all memory  of the past Now we see why the sacrificial crisis is never described in  myths and ritual as it really is There human violence is envisioned as  issuing from some force exterior to man It is one with religion as well  as with those forces that really do emanate from without human will  death illness natural phenomena   Men cannot confront the naked truth of their own violence without  the risk of abandoning themselves to it entirely They have never had a  very clear idea of this violence and it is possible that the survival of all  human societies of the past was dependent on this fundamental lack of  understanding   The Oedipus myth as we have attempted to explain it in the preced ing pages follows a structural pattern that conforms to that of the  surrogate victim Let us now try to determine whether the pattern  recurs in other myths From what we have seen it seems likely that the     Oedipus and the Surrogate Victim S3   process of finding a surrogate victim constitutes a major means per haps the sole means by which men expell from their consciousness the  truth about their violent naturethat knowledge of past violence  which if not shifted to a single guilty figure would poison both the  present and the future   The Thebansreligious believerssought a cure for their ills in a  formal acceptance of the myth in making it the indisputable version of  the events that had recently convulsed the city and in making it the  charter for a new cultural orderby convincing themselves in short  that all their miseries were due exclusively to the plague Such an  attitude requires absolute faith in the guilt of the surrogate victim  And the very first results the sudden restoration of peace seemed to  confirm the identification of the guilty party and also the general  correctness of the diagnosis The crisis is seen as a mysterious illness  introduced into the community by an outsider The cure lies in rid ding the community of the sole malignant element   The curative process is not an illusion and if we give our attention  to the matter we see that no attempt has been made to conceal that  process In fact it is constantly mentioned but in a language and with  a thematic content of its own derivation Naturally this process man ages to encompass the oracular pronouncement reported by Creon the  cure must depend on the identification and expulsion of the individual  whose presence pollutes the community In other terms everybody  must agree on the selection of the guilty individual The surrogate  victim plays the same role on the collective level as the objects the  shamans claim to extract from their patients play on the individual  levelobjects that are then identified as the cause of the illness   Later on in Chapter 9 we shall see that the same forces are at work  in both cases but though similar the two facets of the metaphor are  not equivalent The mechanism of violent unanimity is not modeled on  the technique of the shamans nor is it basically metaphorical in nature  on the other hand there is reason to believe that the technique of the  shamans is modeled on the mechanism of unanimity interpreted in  mythical fashion Parricide and incest provide the community with  exactly what it needs to represent and exorcise the effects of the sacri ficial crisis The myth is there to prove that we are dealing with a  spontaneous process of collective selfmystification the nature of  which escapes not only its direct but also its indirect beneficiariesthe  Freudian psychoanalyst for instance As far as can be ascertained the  operation does not make use of vulgar dissimulation or willful manipu lation of the facts concerning the sacrificial crisis Because the violence  is unanimously ordained it effectively restores peace and order And  the false premises that it maintains acquire in consequence an impreg    84 Violence and the Sacred   nable authority These premises serve to hide from sight the unani mous resolution as well as the sacrificial crisis The resolution serves as  the framework of the myth invisible as long as the structure remains  intact There would be no themes without the structural support of  the anathema The anathemas true object is not Oedipus who is only  one thematic element among others but the unanimous quality of his  selection which if it is to remain effective must be shielded from  scrutiny protected from any outside contact or intervention This  anathema still operates today in the form of neglect through our total  indifference to the concept of collective violence and our refusal to  attach any significance to the phenomenon even when it thrusts itself  upon our attention   The structure of the myth remains unshaken even today Transfer ring it intact into the realm of the imaginary only serves to strengthen  it to render it even less susceptible to analysis No interpretation has  penetrated to the core of the myth Even Freuds famous explanation  of the Oedipus story the most brilliant and misleading of many failed  to establish the true identity of the object being suppressed not the  desire for patricide or incest but the violence that lurked behind these  alltoovisible motifs the menace of total destruction that was diverted  and concealed by means of the surrogate victim   My hypothesis does not require that the mythological text offer a  thematic treatment of condemnation or expulsion directly related to  the underlying source of violence Quite the contrary The absence of  this theme in certain versions of the myth by no means invalidates my  theory All traces of collective violence can and may be eliminated  This does not mean that the effects of the violence have been spent in  fact they are stronger than ever In order for the anathema to deploy  its full force it must slip from sight and from conscious memory   It is not the absence of the anathema from tragedy but rather its  presence that would pose a problem were it not for our belief that the  tragic muse effects a partial demolition of the myth The traces of  religious anathema unearthed in tragedy should be regarded not as  anachronistic survivals from a primitive past but as being in the nature  of an archaeological find The anathema of Oedipus the King should be  viewed as part of Sophocles reading of the myth a reading perhaps  more radical in its implications than we originally imagined The poet  puts some very revealing words in Oedipuss mouth Quickly in the  name of the gods hide me somewhere far away from here Kill me or  hurl me into the sea where I will never be seen again   The extent of the poets understanding of the myth and its origins is  hard to ascertain but it does not have to be complete for tragedy to  represent a progress in the direction of mythical dismantling The     Oedipus and the Surrogate Victim 85   mechanism that produces the surrogate victim is dependent on no one  particular theme because it has engendered them all it cannot be com prehended by means of a purely thematic or structural interpretation  of the play       UNTIL N O W WE HAVE SEEN OEDIPUS only in  terms of his polluted presence as a receptacle for universal shame And  prior to the onslaught of collective violence the hero of Oedipus the  King is just that Another Oedipus emerges however from the final  operation a definitive Oedipus first glimpsed in the final tragedy of  the Oedipus cycle Oedipus at Colonus   In the opening episodes we are still dealing with the original pol luted figure whose appearance within their boundaries fills the inhabi tants of Colonus with dread As the play progresses however a  remarkable change takes place Oedipus is still a dangerous even a  terrifying figure but he has also become very precious to the com munity Colonus and Thebes begin to squabble over the future posses sion of the patricides corpse which is already looked upon as a  valuable relic   What has brought about this change Initially Oedipus was associ ated with the evil aspects of the crisis He possessed no positive quali ties If his exile was a good thing it was so in a purely negative sense  as the amputation of a gangrenous limb is good for an afflicted body  In Oedipus at Colonus however the scope of the drama has been  enlarged Having plunged the community into strife the surrogate  victim restores peace and order by his departure Whereas all the  previous acts of violence compounded the violence the violence di rected against the surrogate victim banished all trace of violence The  explanation for this extraordinary difference falls naturally within the  domain of religion whose concern with the problem is far from idle  since its solution touches on the wellbeing if not the survival of the  community Because human thought has never succeeded in grasping  the mechanism of violent unanimity it naturally turns toward the  victim and seeks to determine whether he is not somehow responsible  for the miraculous consequences of his own death or exile Attention is  drawn not only to the distinctive traits of the decisive actthe form  of the murder for examplebut also to the victims personality Be cause the violence directed against the victim was intended to restore  order and tranquillity it seems only logical to attribute the happy  result to the victim himself   At the supreme moment of the crisis the very instant when recipro cal violence is abruptly transformed into unanimous violence the two  faces of violence seem to be juxtaposed the extremes meet The surro    86 Violence and the Sacred   gate victim serves as catalyst in this metamorphosis And in performing  this function he seems to combine in his person the most pernicious  and most beneficial aspect of violence He becomes the incarnation as  it were of a game men feign to ignore one whose basic rules are  indeed unknown to them the game of their own violence2   It is not enough to say that the surrogate victim symbolizes the  change from reciprocal violence and destruction to unanimous accord  and construction after all the victim is directly responsible for this  change and is an integral part of the process From the purely religious  point of view the surrogate victimor more simply the final victim  inevitably appears as a being who submits to violence without pro voking a reprisal a supernatural being who sows violence to reap  peace a mysterious savior who visits affliction on mankind in order  subsequently to restore it to good health   To our modern way of thinking a hero cannot be good without  ceasing to be evil and vice versa Religious empiricism sees matters  in a different light in a sense it confines itself to recording events as it  sees them Oedipus is initially an evil force and subsequently a benefi cial one It is not a question of exonerating him because the question  of blaming him in the modern moralistic sense of the term never  arises Nor for that matter does religious empiricism show any interest  in initiating one of those programs of rehabilitation so fashionable  today among thinkers who claim to have freed themselves from the  shackles of morality The claims of religious thought are too modest  too tempered by fear for its proponents to assume such lofty attitudes  The mysterious union of the most evil and most beneficial forces is of  vital concern to the community and can neither be challenged nor  ignored Nevertheless it is a paradox that totally escapes human com prehension and religion humbly acknowledges its impotence The  beneficial Oedipus at Colonus supercedes the earlier evil Oedipus but  he does not negate him How could he negate him since it was the  expulsion of a guilty Oedipus that prompted the departure of violence  The peaceful outcome of his expulsion confirms the justice of the  sentence passed on him his unanimous conviction for patricide and  incest If Oedipus is indeed the savior of the community it is because  he is a patricidal and incestuous son   Sophocles two Oedipus tragedies show a pattern of transgression  and salvation long familiar to scholars Such a pattern is to be found in   2 We will see further on that this phenomenon of the transformation of secular  into sacred elements is facilitated by hallucinatory effects that are basic to the  primordial religious experience However it is not essential to have experienced  these effects to grasp the main principles of primitive religious systems The logic  of such systems is now open to view     Oedipus and the Surrogate Victim 81   innumerable tales from folklore and mythology in fairy stories  legends and even in works of literature A source of violence and  disorder during his sojourn among men the hero appears as a redeemer  as soon as he has been eliminated invariably by violent means   It also happens that the hero while remaining a transgressor is cast  primarily as a destroyer of monsters Oedipus appears in this role in the  episode of the Sphinx The Sphinx plays a role similar to that of the  plague terrorizing all Thebes and demanding a periodic tribute of  victims   We must now inquire whether the explanation I have proposed for  the principal episode of the Oedipus myth is equally applicable to  similar mythological tales in other words whether we are in each  instance dealing with a different manifestation of the surrogate victim  Indeed in all such myths the hero draws to himself a violent reaction  whose effects are felt throughout the community He unwittingly con jures up a baleful infectious force that his own deathor triumph  transforms into a guarantee of order and tranquillity   The plague motif is only one of many that could serve equally well  to conceal the presence of the sacrificial crisis and its violent outcome  For example there are stories of collective salvation in which the  death of a single victim serves to appease the anger of some god or  spirit A lone individual who may or may not have been guilty of  some past crime is offered up to a ferocious monster or demon in  order to appease him and he ends up killing that monster as he is killed  by him   The functioning of the surrogate victim explains the principal motifs  of the Oedipus myth and illuminates the genesis and structure of these  motifs Moreover I believe that this same process serves to explain a  great many other myths so many in fact that we cannot help won dering whether it might not be the structural mold of all mythology  Nor do my speculations stop here If the generating spark of religion  itself and the transcendental force that characterizes it are in fact the  product of violent unanimityof social unity forged or reforged by  the expulsion of the surrogate victimthen even more momentous  matters are at issue If this is indeed the case we will find ourselves  dealing not only with myths but also with rituals and the whole ques tion of religion   At present I have done little more than oudine a hypothesis some of  whose elements are still lacking In the chapters to come I hope to fill  out this theory to make clear what must now of necessity seem some what obscure The first task however is to examine the basis of my  hypothesis and attempt to situate it in the context of contemporary  thought     88 Violence and the Sacred   Even at this stage it is apparent 1 believe that the hypothesis casts  light on certain passages in mythological literature Heraclitus who has  been called the philosopher of tragedy and who has equal claim to  the title philosopher of myth seems to have been on the track of the  same structuring force I am now pursuing Perhaps I anticipate but I  cannot refrain from mentioning that certain fragments of Heraclitus  until now mute and indecipherable suddenly assume an obvious mean ing in the light of my hypothesis Does not Fragment 60 display a clear  summation of the origins of myth of the role of violence in the en gendering of the gods and of distinctions Does

Four   The Origins of Myth  and Ritual   efjurll I N T H E STUDY OF PRIMITIVE RELIGION two    W J theories have long held sway The older attributes the   origins of ritual to myth seeking in the mythological construct either  some real event grounded in historical fact or a specific belief that gave  birth to ritualistic practices The more recent theory reverses the pro cedure attributing to ritual not only the origin of myth but also the  origin of the gods andin Greeceof tragedy and other cultural  forms as well Hubert and Mauss belong to the latter school of thought  In sacrifice they see the genesis of the gods The repetition of these  ceremonies in which either by custom or for any other reason an  identical victim reappears at regular intervals ends by creating a sort  of personality The accumulation of past sacrifices thus culminates in  the creation of a god while the individual rite preserves its secondary  effects1   Sacrifice is here visualized as engendering religion This means of  course that we cannot expect to learn anything about the origin of  sacrifice itself from Hubert and Mauss for when a phenomenon is used  to explain other phenomena it can generally be assumed that no ex planation of the explanatory phenomenon will be forthcoming The  latter becomes a kind of unformulated dogma to be accepted on pure  faith Whatever makes other things clear does not need apparently to  be made clear itself   Hubert and Mauss have nothing to say about the origins of sacrificial  practice and very little about its nature and function even though  their discussion is entitled Sacrifice Its Nature and Function As we  have already seen the notion that sacrifice serves primarily to bring us  into contact with the gods makes little sense For even if the gods are  imaged forth at the conclusion of a long series of sacrifices what are  we to make of the preliminary rounds What were the sacrificers  thinking about at a time when they did not yet

modern  antitheists to shift all blame onto the godsv must not lead us astray  Sacrifice deals with humankind and it is in human terms that we must  attempt to comprehend it   Hubert and Mausss failure to come to grips with the origin and  function of sacrifice makes their accurate description of its operation  even more remarkable One cannot attribute this accuracy to some a  priori concept for sacrifice still awaits its proper interpretation   The resemblances among the rites practiced in disparate cultures are  striking and the variations from one culture to another are never  sufficient to disguise the basic similarities Hubert and Mauss can thus  feel justified in describing the sacrificial process outside the context of  any specific culture as if it were some kind of technique And a  technique it truly is but does this technique as these two authors  contend have no real object and serve no function in the social pro cess How can an institution that is ultimately judged fantastical and  imaginary manifest such remarkable similarities from culture to cul ture It is no longer a question of appealing to diffusionist theories  they had already been discredited and with good reason at the time  Hubert and Mauss were writing   The more one reflects on these structural similarities the more one is  tempted to qualify them as not merely surprising but dowrnright  miraculous And while admiring the descriptive powers of Hubert and  Mauss one cannot help wishing they shared that irrepressible inquisi tiveness that characterized some of their predecessors Yet it was  undoubtedly necessary to set aside a great many problems in order to  schematize certain forms of analysisand that is precisely what these  two authors did Undoubtedly a provisional limiting of the field of  study serves to bring into relief certain areas that had previously been  neglected and misunderstood   In scientific research as in warfare it is always prudentfor the  sake of moraleto represent strategic retreats in a positive light All  the same workers in the field must take care not to mistake these  retreats for glorious victories In all the social sciences today the ten dencies apparent in the work of Hubert and Mauss seem to have swept  the field It is no longer a question of relating ritual to myth or even  myth to ritual Such procedures invariably produced a circular train of  argument from which the only means of escape seemed to lie in desig nating some arbitrary point of departure It is good that this futile  mode of thought has been abandoned Another positive development is  the recognition that if a solution to the problem exists it exists at the  center of the circle not on the periphery What is decidedly not good     The Origins of Myth and Ritual 91   is the conclusion that either this center is totally inaccessible or there is  no center at all   Such pessimistic suppositions based on past failures purport to be  ultrascientific but are in fact questions of philosophy and tempera ment Past failures prove nothing outside their own context It is fool hardy to condemn the search for a real origin simply because the  search has not been successful so far Antimetaphysical speculation is  after all another form of metaphysics At any moment a new theory  may arise that will provide a satisfactorythat is a scientificanswer  to the question of the origins nature and function not onlv of sacrifice  but also of religion in general   It is not enough to declare certain problems null and void after a  cursory and purely symbolic investigation in order to lay claim to a  scientific approach Science is not a refuge for philosophic skepticism  a pose of sage resignation All great discoveries begin with a sense of  curiositv that is todav often dismissed as childish and a faith in the  resources of language even the most commonplace language that is  often condemned as naive When the nil admixari of those bourgeois  dandys caricatured by Stendhal passes for the last word in understand ing we have just cause for alarm The relative failure of Frazer Freud  or Robertson Smith is no reason to regard their insistence on getting  to the bottom of things as foolish or outdated To assert that there is  nothing to be gained by seeking out the function and origin of ritual is  to say that the language of religion is destined to remain forever a dead  letter a kind of gibberishcleverly codified perhaps but devoid of  any real meaning   From time to time a voice is heard calling our attention to the very  strangeness of institutions such as sacrifice and attempting to satisfy  our deep need to find a firm basis in reality for these institutions  Adolphe Jensen for one managed to reopen the great inquiries of the  pastand it is perhaps for that very reason that his work has received  so litde notice from contemporary scholars Jensen writes   Man must have been subjected to some particularly overwhelming ex periences to have been led to introduce such cruel practices into his life  What could have been the reasons   What could have persuaded men to kill their fellowbeingsnot in  the wanton amoral manner of barbarians succumbing to their instincts  but as a reflex of the awakened consciousness of the creator of cultural  forms seeking to comprehend the innermost nature of the world and to  transmit this knowledge to future generations by means of dramatic  representations    iMythological thought always returns to what  happened initially to the act of creation justly assuming that this oc currence sheds the brightest most revealing light on a given subject        92 Violence and the Sacred   If murder plays such a decisive role in the sacrificial rite this means that  it must have played a particularly important part in the initial impulse2   I do not deny the utility of recent descriptive contributions But I  believe the time has come for us to ask ourselves once again whether  something of vital importance did indeed take place imtially We must  return to the traditional questions reframing them in terms of the  rigorous methodology of our own times   Once we have determined the underlying principle of our search  we should consider the a priori conditions that any theory must fulfill  to command our scrutiny If sacrifice has a real origin the memory of  which myths keep alive in one way and rituals commemorate in an other then it seems clear that wre are dealing with an event that  initially made a very strong impression Very strong but not unforget tablefor in the end it is forgotten But this impression although  subject to later modification lives on in the religious observances and  perhaps in all the cultural manifestations of the society There is no  need to postulate some form of individual or collective subconscious to  account for its survival   The extraordinary number of commemorative rites that have to do  with killing leads us to imagine that the original event must have been a  murder Freud in Totem and Taboo lucidly perceived this necessity  And the remarkable similarities among the sacrificial rites of various  localities suggest that the murder was always of the same general type  This does not mean that the murder was a single historical event or  that it belongs exclusively to prehistory Although the event looks  exceptional from the perspective of any given society it seems quite  commonplace in a broad comparative context   The sacrificial crisis and the surrogatevictim mechanism fulfill all  the conditions required of a satisfactory hypothesis   But it may be protested if such an event had actually taken place  science would already have discovered it This assertion fails to take  into account an extraordinary deficiency of modern science The pres ence of a religious element at the source of all human societies is  indubitable yet of all social institutions religion is the only one to  which science has been unable to attribute a genuine objective a real  function I contend that the objective of ritual is the proper reenact ment of the surrogatevictim mechanism its function is to perpetuate  or renew the effects of this mechanism that is to keep violence outside  the community   2Adolphe E Jensen Mytbes et cultes chez les peuples prhnitifs Paris 1954  pp 20W     The Origins of Myth and Ritual 93   QJ4 I BEGAN BY REMARKING on the cathartic func tion of sacrifice and went on to define the sacrificial crisis as the loss of  this function as well as of all cultural distinctions If the unanimous  violence directed against the surrogate victim succeeds in bringing this  crisis to an end clearly this violence must be at the origin of a new  sacrificial system If the surrogate victim can interrupt the destructur ing process it must be at the origin of structure We shall see further  on whether it is possible to verify this assertion with regard to those  rites and regulations that are essential to a cultural orderfestivals  rites of passage proscriptions against incest etc At present we have  good reason to believe that the violence directed against the surrogate  victim might well be radically generative in that by putting an end to  the vicious and destructive cycle of violence it simultaneously initiates  another and constructive cycle that of the sacrificial ritewhich pro tects the community from that same violence and allows culture to  flourish   If this is true the generative violence constitutes at least the indirect  origin of all those things that men hold most dear and that they strive  most ardently to preserve This notion is affirmed though in a veiled  and transfigured manner by the many etiological myths that deal with  the murder of one mythological character by other mythological char acters That event is conceived as the origin of the cultural order the  dead divinity becomes the source not only of sacred rites but also of  matrimonial regulations and proscriptions of every kind in short of all  those cultural forms that give man his unique humanity   In some cases the mythological characters are said to grant men  whatever they need to live in society in other cases they deny them  these same benefits In either case men manage to obtain what they  require sometimes by theft or trickery but not before one of the  mythological characters has been isolated from the others and sub jected to some unusual accident or misfortune This accident may be  fatal sometimes it is merely ludicrous We must recognize in it a mask  of the collective violence that terminates the crisis Sometimes the  central figure breaks away from the group and flees taking with him  the object in dispute Generally he is overtaken and put to death  occasionally he is merely wounded or beaten Sometimes it is he who  demands to be beaten and at each blow extraordinary benefits accrue  giving rise to a fertility and an abundance that assures the harmonious  functioning of the cultural order   The mythical narrative sometimes takes the form of a contest or  game a quasisportive or pugilistic event that evokes the rivalries in herent in the sacrificial crisis Behind all these themes one can detect     94 Violence and the Sacred   the outline of reciprocal violence gradually transformed into a unani mous act It is certainly astonishing that all human activities and even  the course of nature itself are subordinated to this metamorphosis of  violence taking place at the heart of the community When relation ships between men are troubled when men cease to cooperate among  themselves and to come to terms with one another there is no human  enterprise that does not suffer Even the success of the hunt of fishing  expeditions of food gathering is put in question Therefore the bene fits attributed to the generative violence extend beyond mankind to  nature itself The act of collective murder is seen as the source of all  abundance the principle of procreation is attributed to it and all those  plants that are useful to man everything beneficial and nutritive is said  to take root in the body of the primordial victim   Even Hubert and Mauss cite facts that should serve to bring socially  aware investigators into direct contact with social realities Side by side  with myths in which the element of generative mob action is barely  discernible there exist others in which its presence is explicitly ac knowledged Such transparent myths are by no means confined to  those cultures we Western humanists might be tempted to qualify as  primitive or crude Hubert and Mauss offer an exemplary specimen  from Greece At Troezen in the peribolos of the temple of Hippoly tos the death of the foreign goddesses Damia and Auxesia was com memorated by an annual festival the lithobolia According to tradition  the two virgin goddesses from Crete were stoned to death in the  course of an uprising These foreigners represent the foreigner the  passerby who often plays a role in the harvest festivals and the lapida tion is a sacrificial rite3   Associated with the Oedipus myth are rites like those involving the  pharmakos whose true significance becomes clear in the light of the  above comments The city of Athens prudently kept on hand a num ber of unfortunate souls whom it maintained at public expense for  appointed times as well as in certain emergencies Whenever some  calamity threatenedplague famine foreign invasion or internal  dissensionthere was always a pharmakos at the disposal of the  communitv   The complete explanation of the Oedipus myththat is the deter mining of the precise function of the surrogate victimpermits us to  understand the aim of the sacrificers They are striving to produce a  replica as faithful as possible in every detail of a previous crisis that  was resolved by means of a spontaneously unanimous victimization All  the dangers real and imaginary that threaten the community are sub  3 Hubert and Mauss Sacrifice p 83     The Origins of Myth and Ritual 95   sumed in the most terrible danger that can confront a society the  sacrificial crisis The rite is therefore a repetition of the original spon taneous lynching that restored order in the community by reestab lishing around the figure of the surrogate victim that sentiment of  social accord that had been destroyed in the onslaught of reciprocal  violence Like Oedipus the victim is considered a polluted object  whose living presence contaminates everything that comes in contact  with it and whose death purges the community of its illsas the sub sequent restoration of public tranquillity clearly testifies That is why  the pharmakos was paraded about the city He was used as a kind of  sponge to sop up impurities and afterward he was expelled from the  community or killed in a ceremony that involved the entire populace   If my thesis is correct the pharmakos like Oedipus himself has a  dual connotation On the one hand he is a woebegone figure an object  of scorn who is also weighed down with guilt a butt for all sorts of  gibes insults and of course outbursts of violence On the other hand  we find him surrounded by a quasireligious aura of veneration he has  become a sort of cult object This duality reflects the metamorphosis  the ritual victim is designed to effect the victim draws to itself all the  violence infecting the original victim and through its own death trans forms this baneful violence into beneficial violence into harmony and  abundance   It is not surprising that the word pharmakon in classical Greek  means both poison and the antidote for poison both sickness and cure  in short any substance capable of perpetrating a very good or very  bad action according to the circumstances and the dosage The  pharmakon is thus a magic drug or volatile elixir whose administration  had best be left by ordinary men in the hands of those who enjoy  special knowledge and exceptional powerspriests magicians shamans  doctors and so on4   The comparison of Oedipus and the pharmakos is not meant to  imply that we accept the views of certain scholars most notably the  earlytwentiethcentury Cambridge Ritualists who have proposed a  purely ritualistic interpretation of tragedy It is evident that the Oedi pus myth is intimately associated with rites analogous to those involv ing the pharmakos but we must take care not to confuse the myth and  ritual on the one hand with the essentially antimythical and antiritu alistic inspiration of the drama on the other The Cambridge Ritualists  and their disciples have based their interpretation of the role of the  pharmakos on the idea that seasonal changethe death and resur rection of natureconstitutes the original model for the rite its deep   Cf Chapter 11 pp 29697     96 Violence and the Sacred   seated meaning In fact there is nothing in nature that could encourage  or even suggest such an atrocious sort of ritual killing as the death of  the pharmakos In my opinion the sole possible model remains the  sacrificial crisis and its resolution Nature enters the picture later when  the ritualistic mind succeeds in detecting certain similarities between  natures rhythms and the communitys alternating pattern of order and  disorder The modus operandi of violencesometimes reciprocal and  pernicious sometimes unanimous and beneficialis then taken as the  model for the entire universe   To portray tragedy as a repetition and an adaptation of the seasonal  rites a sort of sacre du printemps is surely to strip it of those very  elements that mark it as tragedy This remains true even if it is correct  ultimately to confer on tragedy a quasiritualistic value in Western  culture Frazer and the Cambridge Ritualists center their interpretation  on seasonal and agricultural connotations that do play an important  role in many festivals but that are ultimately derived like all other  connotations from the victimization mechanism The connection be tween the drama and the major mythological themes is undeniable but  in order to grasp its full significance we must transcend the approach  that limits itself to thematic analysis and renounce those prejudices that  might lead us to portray the scapegoat purely as a product of blind  superstition a nonfunctional device bereft of any operative value In  the scapegoat theme we should recognize the very real metamorphosis  of reciprocal violence into restraining violence through the agency of  unanimitr This unique mechanism structures all cultural values even  as it conceals itself behind them it is associated even more fundamen tally with the doubleedged images of myths and rituals Sophocles  appends nothing to the scapegoat theme its broader meaning is  not simply tacked on nor has the tragic poet on his own initiative  turned Oedipus into a reflection of the human condition Scapegoat  effects are more deeply rooted in the human condition than we are  willing to admit5   My hypothesis is becoming at once broader and more precise It  should permit us to see through certain previously impenetrable reli  5 A number of French scholars have detected in the Oedipus of both myth and  tragedy a pharmakos and a scapegoat According to Marie Delcourt the institu tion of the scapegoat explains the fate of the infant Oedipus abandoned by his  parents Oedipus is offered as a scapegoat by a father called Laius that is to say  Publius the representative of the people The murder by exposure of weak or  illformed infants was extremely widespread and is certainly associated with the  concept of the surrogate victimthat is with the unanimous basis of all sacrificial  rites It is the indication of that unanimity among the general populace that Marie  Delcourt has touched upon here Legendes et cultes de keros en Grece Paris  1942 p 102 Cf also her Oedipe et la legende du conquerant Paris 1944     The Origins of Myth and Ritual 91   gious acts such as the execution of the pharmakos and to discern their  perfectly intelligible aims As we will soon discover this same hypoth esis pertains not only to rites as a general category but also to their  most minute details Hitherto I have examined only those sacrifices  that involve human victims The link between the rite and the func tioning of violent unanimity is especially apparent when the original  victim also happens to have been a human being In such instances the  effort at imitation is easy to discern   We should now ask ourselves whether animal sacrifices too cannot  be defined as the mimesis of an initial collective murder In my first  chapter I suggested that there was no essential difference between  human and animal sacrifice If this is true the origin of all sacrifices  must be the same The celebrated Judaic scapegoat and all animal rites  of the same type lend strong support to my hypothesis But there is  surely no harm in pausing a moment longer to examine a classical  case of animal sacrifice in order to demonstrate if possible its direct  connection with the execution of a surrogate victim If it can be shown  that the sacrificial rites are indeed striving to reproduce the mechanism  of violent unanimity and that the surrogate victim is indeed the key to  all these rites considerable new light will be shed on the matter of  animal sacrifice   Let us turn our attention to one of those rare societies in which  sacrifice survives to this day as a living institution and whose customs  have been diligently recorded by a trained ethnologist In Divinity and  Experience Godfrey Lienhardt describes in detail several sacrificial  ceremonies that he witnessed among the Dinka I will summarize the  general substance of his descriptions taking care to emphasize those  points that seem especially significant   The insistent rhythm of choral incantations gradually captures the  attention of a crowd of bystanders who at first appeared scattered and  selfabsorbed Participants begin to brandish weapons in mock warfare  A few isolated individuals strike out at others but without any real  hostility In these preparatory stages violence is therefore already  present in a ritual form but it is still manifestly reciprocal the ritualis tic imitation deals first with the sacrificial crisis itself with the chaotic  antecedents to the unanimous resolution From time to time somebody  detaches himself from the group to beat the cow or calf that has been   More recently JeanPierre Vernant has taken up these ideas and exploits some of  their possibilities in his thematic analysis of Oedipus the King Divine ruler and  pharmakos these are the two faces of Oedipus It is this duality that accounts for  his enigmatic aspect that unites in him like an ambiguous phrase two inverse  images superimposed one upon the other To this inversion in Oedipuss nature  Sophocles appends a broader meaning the hero as a reflection of the human  condition Vernant Ambiguite et renversement p 1271     98 Violence and the Sacred   tied to a nearby stake or to hurl insults at it There is nothing static or  stilted about the performance it succeeds in giving shape to a collec tive impulse that gradually triumphs over the forces of dispersion and  discord by bringing corporate violence to bear on a ritual victim In  this rite the metamorphosis of reciprocal violence into unilateral vio lence is explicitly and dramatically reenacted And it seems to me that  the same can be seen to hold true for an infinite number of rites if one  keeps a sharp eye out for signs often admittedly fragmentary and  elusive that reveal the functioning of this particular metamorphosis  In the oftencited example of the Greek Bouphonia the participants  make a point of quarreling among themselves before turning their  attention to the designated victim 11 the mock battles that generally  take place prior to sacrificial ceremonies and all the ritual dances whose  formal symmetry is reflected in a perpetual confrontation between the  performers lend themselves to an interpretation in which the perfor mances are seen as imitative responses to a sacrificial crisis   In the Dinka sacrifice it seems that the paroxysm takes place not at  the death of the victim but in the course of the ritual curses pro nounced before its death One gets the impression that these curses are  in themselves able to destroy the victim that it is as in tragedy for all  practical purposes killed by words And these words even if they are  not firmly fixed by custom are fundamentally identical to the accusa tions hurled by Tiresias against Oedipus The actual execution some times consists of a veritable stampede of the entire group directed  against the victim In this case it is the victims genitals that are singled  out The same is true of the pharmakos who is whipped on his sexual  organs with herbaceous plants There is thus some reason to believe  that the animal victim is a standin for an original victim accused like  Oedipus of patricide incest or of some other sexual transgression that  signifies the violent abolition of distinctionsthe major cause of cul tural disintegration The means of dispatching the victim may vary  depending on the nature of the crime but the death sentence itself  remains invariable The ritualistic mentality imagines that this death  will result in benefits too great to be ascribed to a simple punitive  measure These benefits must be real But the ritualistic mentality does  not understand why they have accrued the only explanations it can  offer are mythic However this same mentality has a good notion of  how these benefits are obtained and it tries unceasingly to repeat the  fruitful process   The scorn hostility and cruelty displayed toward the animal prior  to the ritualistic slaughter are replaced upon its death by a show of  ritualistic veneration In bearing away into death the scourge of re ciprocal violence the victim has performed its assigned function     The Origins of Myth and Ritual 99   Henceforth the victim will incarnate violence in both its guises bene ficial and baneful that is it will personify the AllPowerful who rules  from on high Having been so flagrantly abused it is only reasonable  that the victim should be greatly honoredjust as it was reasonable to  banish Oedipus when he seemed the bearer of ill fortune and reason able to honor him when his departure assured the communitys well being That adopting the former attitude assures the latter result seems  to confirm the rationality of the plan despite its contradictory appear ance   Lienhardt himself defines the victim as a scapegoat who becomes the  receptacle of human passions We are dealing here with an animal  pharmakos a calf or cow that assumes not some vague and illdefined  sins but the very real though often hidden hostilities that all the  members of the community feel for one another Our portrayal of  sacrifice as an imitation and reenactment of spontaneous collective vio lence in no way conflicts with the definition I proposed in Chapter 1  In fact spontaneous violence contains an element of appeasement that  can also be found in ritual sacrifice though in diluted form In the  original event it is unleashed violence that is checked and at the same  time partially appeased in the ritual reenactment it is the more or less  latent aggressions that are dealt with   The community is both attracted and repelled by its own origins It  feels the constant need to reexperience them albeit in veiled and trans figured form By means of rites the community manages to cajole and  somewhat subdue the forces of destruction But the true nature and  real function of these forces will always elude its grasp precisely be cause the source of the evil is the community itself The only way in  which the ritualistic imagination can succeed in its selfappointed task  a task both painstaking and elusiveis by allowing violence a certain  amount of free play as in the original instance but not too much that  is by exercising its memory of the collective expulsion on carefully  designated objects and within a rigorous framework   In societies where sacrifice is still a living institution it displays the  cathartic function I attributed to it in my first chapter The catharsis is  performed in a structural setting so strikingly similar to that of unani mous violence that one can only conclude that it is a deliberate if not  an entirely exact imitation of unanimous violence   X A N Y THESIS THAT MAINTAINS that ritual is the  imitation and reenactment of spontaneous unanimous violence may  well seem fanciful even fantastic as long as one considers a few iso lated rites But when one widens the scope of the inquiry supporting  evidence appears at every turn Seen from a broad perspective certain     100 Violence and the Sacred   mythological and ritualistic analogies previous overlooked leap into  view Even a cursory examination reveals that the theme of unanimity  recurs with extraordinary frequency in all aspects of religious life in  rituals and in myths It recurs in cultures so far apart in forms so  disparate and in texts so diverse in nature that it is impossible to  explain it away through some diffusionist theory   As noted above the Dinka sacrificial execution often takes the form  of a stampede of young men who trample the beast down and crush  him by their sheer mass When the animal is too large to be killed in  this way he is slaughtered in a more conventional manner but a simu lated stampede is still performed as a prelude to the slaughter The  sacrificial ceremony requires a show of collective participation if only  in purely symbolic form This association of the collectivity with the  killing of the sacrificial victim is found in numerous instancesnotably  in the Dionysiac sparagmos which I will discuss later on6 All the  participants without exception are required to take part in the death  scene The same is true for the Arabian camel sacrifice described in  Robertson Smiths Religion of the Semites and for a good many other  sacrificial rituals   It is a unanimous group that Odysseus and his companions plunge  the redhot stake into the Cyclops eye It is as a unanimous group that  the gods of some of the generative myths conspire and bring about the  death of one of their divine colleagues In Hindu mythology the same  motif recurs The YadjonrVeda speaks of a sacrificial ceremony in  which a god Soma is to be put to death by the other gods Mithra at  first refuses to join his divine companions in the act but he is finally  persuaded to do so by the argument that the sacrifice will be totally  ineffective if not performed by all This myth offers a prescription for  the correct performance of a sacrifice Unanimity is a formal require ment the abstention of a single participant renders the sacrifice even  worse than uselessit make it dangerous   In the story of the murder of Hainuwele mythological heroine of the  Ceram Islanders the sacrificers stamp on her grave in a manner that  emphatically underlines the unanimous and collective character of the  enterprise The signs of unanimity displayed in some local myth can  reappear in identical form in a ritual peformed by some other com munity For example the NgadjuDayaks of Borneo first sacrifice  slaves then perform a burial rite that involves all the participants  stamping on the graves In fact the NgadjuDayaks demand total par ticipation in all their sacrificial rites The long drawn out agony of the    Cf Chapter 5 131     The Origins of Myth and Ritual 101   slaves execution yields nothing to psychological explanations What  counts is the communal gesture of unanimity therefore all the partic ipants in the sacrifice are required to strike the victim before its death  The ritualistic structure of the ceremony is strictly regulated and re flects the hierarchical distinctions that govern the cultural order Ani mal sacrifices are performed in the same manner7   Even in a society such as the Kaingang wracked by reciprocal vio lence the demand for unanimity reappears in bastard form The  murderers never wanted to act alone They insisted on the collaboration  of the members of the group To demand that the final blow be deliv ered by someone else is the usual practice at Kaingang murders8   There is no question of denying the psychological significance of such  accounts quite the contrary In the absence of any collective struc turalization our only recourse is the psychological interpretation No  ritual context is available evil violence runs wild   k THE FUNCTION OF SACRIFICE as defined in Chap ter 1 not only allows for but requires a surrogate victimin other  words violent unanimity In ritual sacrifice the victim when actually  put to death diverts violence from its forbidden objectives within the  community But for whom precisely is this victim substituted Here tofore we could only conceive of this substitution in terms of indi vidual psychological mechanisms which clearly do not provide an  adequate picture of the process If there were no surrogate victim to  transform the sacrifice from an essentially private concern into one  involving the whole community we would be obliged to regard the  victim as a substitute for particular individuals who have somehow  provoked the sacrificed anger If the transfer is purely personal as it  is in psychoanalysis then sacrifice cannot be a true social institution  involving the entire community But sacrifice as we know is essentially  a communal institution Individualization marks a later decadent  stage in its evolution a development contrary to its original spirit   To understand how and why sacrifice functions as it does we should  consider the proposition that the ritual victim is never substituted for  some particular member of the community or even for the community  as a whole it is always substituted for the surrogate victim As this  victim itself serves as a substitute for all the members of the com munity the sacrificial substitution does indeed play the role that we   7 H Sharer Die Bedeutung des Menschenopfers im Dagakischen Toten Kult  Mitteilungen

 have attributed to it protecting all the members of the community  from their respective violencebut always through the intermediary  of the surrogate victim   This observation should clear me of any suspicion of psychologiz ing while eliminating a serious objection to basing the present theory  on sacrificial substitution If the entire community were not already  subsumed under a single head that of the surrogate victim it would be  impossible to attribute to the sacrificial substitution the significance we  have claimed for it impossible to establish a social basis for the institu tion   The original act of violence is unique and spontaneous Ritual sacri fices however are multiple endlessly repeated All those aspects of the  original act that had escaped mans controlthe choice of time and  place the selection of the victimare now premeditated and fixed by  custom The ritual process aims at removing all element of chance and  seeks to extract from the original violence some technique of cathartic  appeasement The diluted force of the sacrificial ritual cannot be at tributed to imperfections in its imitative technique After all the rite is  designed to function during periods of relative calm as we have seen  its role is not curative but preventive If it were more effective than  it in fact isif it did not limit itself to appropriate sacrificial victims  but instead like the original act of violence vented its force on a  participating member of the communitythen it would lose all effec tiveness for it would bring to pass the very thing it was supposed to  prevent a relapse into the sacrificial crisis The sacrificial process is as  fully adapted to its normal function as collective murder is to its ab normal and normative function There is every reason to believe that  the minor catharsis of the sacrificial act is derived from that major  catharsis circumscribed by collective murder   Ritual sacrifice is founded on a double substitution The first which  passes unperceived is the substitution of one member of the com munity for all brought about through the operation of the surrogate  victim The second the only truly ritualistic substitution is super imposed on the first It is the substitution of a victim belonging to a  predetermined sacrificial category for the original victim The surro gate victim comes from inside the community and the ritual victim  must come from outside otherwise the community might find it diffi cult to unite against it   How it may be asked does the second substitution graft itself onto  the first How does the original violence succeed in imposing a cen trifugal force on the rite In short how does the sacrificial technique  operate I will attempt to return to these questions but at this point I  wish to draw attention to the essentially mimetic character of sacrifice     The Origins of Myth and Ritual 103   with regard to the original generative act of violence Thanks to this  mimetic aspect we can understand how the sacrificial process can exist  and function without being obliged to attribute to the ritualistic mind  a manipulative ability or a clairvoyance that it most certainly does not  possess   It is entirely possible to regard the sacrificial rite as a commemora tion of a real event without reducing it to the triviality of one of our  own national holidays or for that matter without ascribing it to some  neurotic compulsion as psychoanalysts are wont to do A trace of very  real violence persists in the rite and there is no doubt that the rite  succeeds at least partially because of its grim associations its lingering  fascination but its essential orientation is peaceful Even the most vio lent rites are specifically designed to abolish violence To see these rites  as expressions of mans pathological morbidity is to miss the point   It goes without saying that the rite has its violent aspects but these  always involve a lesser violence proffered as a bulwark against a far  more virulent violence Moreover the rite aims at the most profound  state of peace known to any community the peace that follows the  sacrificial crisis and results from the unanimous accord generated by  the surrogate victim To banish the evil emanations that accumulate  within the community and to recapture the freshness of this original  experience are one and the same task Whether order reigns supreme  or whether its reign is already challenged the same model the same  plan of action is invariablv proposed It is the plan associated with the  victorious resolution of all communal crises that involves violence  against the surrogate victim   e4 WE ARE EVOLVING A THEORY of myth and ritual  in short of religion as a whole Up to this point the analyses of the  crucial role attributed to the surrogate victim and to unanimous vio lence may have appeared too summary too incomplete for this theory  to seem much more than a working hypothesis At this stage of our  exposition we can hardly hope to have banished all the readers doubts  A thesis that attributes a real origin to religion demands the abandon ment of too many currently accepted ideas and the rethinking of too  many fundamental concepts to be readily accepted expecially when it  is not susceptible to direct verification If ritual imitation no longer  recalls precisely what it is imitating if the secret of the primordial  event has been allowed to slip from its memory then the rite involves a  form of delusion that has never subsequently been understood   No single rite will reproduce point for point the operations my  hypothesis proposes as the origin of all rites A delusion concerning its  own factual basisnot the absence of that basisis characteristic of     104 Violence and the Sacred   religion And the source of this delusion is none other than the surro gate victim or rather the fact which remains unperceived that the  surrogate victim is arbitrarily chosen The ritualistic mind strives to  reproduce the operation of violent unanimity without understanding its  mimetic nature If my hypothesis is correct no single religious form will  suffice to illuminate the whole picture but a multiplicity of examples  will cast light on its various aspects until everything gradually becomes  clear and certainty prevails   In order to verify my hypothesis then it must be applied to many  different forms of ritual and myth as far apart in content history and  geography as possible If it is correct the complex rites will provide  the most striking confirmation The more complex a system the more  numerous will be the elements it strives to reproduce in the operation  analyzed above As most of these elements are in principle already in  our possession the most difficult problems should resolve themselves of  their own accord The scattered fragments of the system should  cohere and the unintelligible become intelligible   The sacred monarchies of continental Africa have long resisted all  attempts at analysis In discussing the complexity of their structures  scholars have had recourse to such adjectives as strange and aber rant In an era when it was still believed possible to classify all rituals  under more or less logical headings the African rites were generally  grouped under the rubric Exceptions   In one important group situated between Egypt and Swaziland the  king is required to commit an act of incest either real or symbolic on  certain solemn occasionsnotablv at his enthronement or in the  course of the periodic rites of renewal Among the kings possible  partners are virtually all the women formally forbidden him by  matrimonial regulations mother sisters daughters nieces cousins etc  Sometimes the parentage is real sometimes classificatory In societies  where the incestuous act is no longer actually consummatedif in deed it ever wasa symbolism of incest persists As Luc de Heusch  has pointed out the important role played by the queen mother in  these societies can only be understood in the context of ritual incest9   In order to understand royal incest we must take care not to wrench  it from its context as is too often done by writers captivated by its  sensational aspects This rite forms part of an overall ritualistic proce dure that prescribes the other transgressions the king must commit  before he takes office For example he must eat certain forbidden  foods and commit certain acts of violence In some instances he is  literally bathed in blood and fed concoctions whose ingredients   9 Luc de Heusch Essai ntr le symbolisme de Vinceste royal en Afrique Brus sels 1958     The Origins of Myth and Ritual 105   bloody offal and refuse of all kinds indicate their evil character In  some societies the whole enthronement ceremony takes place in an  atmosphere of bloodstained confusion It is not a question then of  one particular forbidden act or of one act being particularly forbidden  On occasion the king is required to commit all the forbidden acts that  are imaginable and possible for him to commit The encyclopedic  character of the transgressions as well as the eclectic nature of the  incestuous act betray who it is that the king is supposed to incarnate  the paragon of transgressors the man who holds nothing sacred and  who fearlessly assumes every form of hubris   We are not dealing here with royal peccadilloes in the class let us  say of Louis XIVs mistressesobjects of amused forebearance per haps but accorded no official position by the community The African  peoples close their eyes to nothing in fact they keep them wide open  and incest in their judgment often constitutes the sine qua non of  accession to the throne That is not to say that such infractions are no  longer considered reprehensible when committed by a king On the  contrary it is because of their ability to remain reprehensible that  these infractions are selected These acts bestow on the king a particu larly potent form of pollution which is repeatedly alluded to in the  symbolic imagery of the ceremonies Among the Bushongs for ex ample where rats are regarded as nyec disgusting and held as taboo  the king is formally presented at his coronation with a basket full of  these rodents10 The theme of the leperking is sometimes associated  with this same ceremony the new king is proclaimed the descendant  and heir of a royal leper who was the first to occupy the throne11   The cultures that practice royal incest sometimes offer an interpreta tion of it that cannot be taken seriously It is asserted that the king  chooses a wife from among his close relatives in order to preserve the  purity of the royal blood This explanation will not do Clearly the in cest as well as the other forbidden acts are designed to make the  king the very incarnation of impurity It is because of this impurity  that the king in the course of the enthronement and renewal cere monies is subjected to the ritualistic insults and abuse of his people A  hostile crowd denounces the misconduct of this miscreant who is as  yet nothing more than a criminal and a social outcast In some instances  the royal army stages a mock attack on the kings personal bodyguard  and even on the king himself   If one chooses to make a criminal of ones king and requires him to  violate the most sacred laws in particular the laws of exogamy it   i J Vansina Initiation Rite of the Bushong Africa 25 1955 14950 Quoted  by Laura Makarius Du roi magique au roi divin Annates 25 no 3 1970677   11 Makarius Du roi magique au roi divin p 670     106 Violence and the Sacred   cannot be for the pleasure of pardoning him or of displaying ones  generosity of spirit On the contrary all this takes place because pun ishment of the severest sort seems to be in order and the needful  insults and hostilities find their outlet in sacrificial ceremonies in which  the king plays the chief rolethe role of the original victim I have  insisted on the need to view royal incest in its proper ritual context  This context is not limited to the act itself it appears also to include  the real or symbolic sacrifice of the monarch And the sacrifice of the  king is clearly a punishment for his transgressions The idea that the  king is sacrificed because he has lost his strength or virility is as fanci ful as the theory that royal incest preserves the purity of the family  strain Both theories are tardy afterthoughts designed to supply an  ideological basis for the rites Few ethnologists take them seriously and  ethnological evidence offers good reason to doubt them In Ruanda  for example the king and the queen motherclearly an incestuous  couplemust periodically submit to a sacrificial rite that can only be  regarded as a symbolic punishment for incest The royal pair ap peared in public bound like captives condemned to death A bull and a  cow their substitutes were clubbed to the ground and slaughtered  The king then mounted the flanks of the bull and some of the bulls  blood was poured over him so as to carry the symbolic resemblance  between the two as far as possible12   It should now be clear what scenario the king is acting out and what  place incest occupies in the plot This scenario is very like the Oedipus  mythnot by reason of historical affiliation but because the mythic  and ritualistic imaginations are using the same model in both cases  Behind the pageantry of the African monarchies lurks the specter of  the sacrificial crisis suddenly resolved by the unanimity arising from  the generative act of violence Each African king is a new Oedipus  obliged to play out his own myth from beginning to end because  ritualistic theory sees in this enactment the means of renewing and  perpetuating a cultural order that is constantly on the brink of destruc tion As in the case of Oedipus there was a charge of incest associated  with the original act of mob violence and serving as its justification an  accusation seemingly confirmed by the effective results of the collec tive action The king is thus required to do what he was originally  accused of and to do it not to public acclaim but to the angry protests  that accompanied the original accusation In principle the charge of  incest will at each successive enthronement give rise to the same indig nation the same collective violence that on the original occasion ac  12 Luc de Heusch Aspects de la sacralite du pouvoir en Afrique in Le Pou voir et le sacre Brussels 1962 Cited in L de Lagger Le Ruanda ancient

royal incest and a prior accusation of in cest is often confirmed by an etiological myth H J Krige and J D  Krige report such a myth among the Lovedu13 Incest presides over  the birth of society it is the bearer of peace and abundance to man kind But incest is neither a first cause nor an essential condition Al though it may initially appear to offer justification for the act of  sacrifice on a deeper level it is the act of sacrifice that justifies the  incest The king reigns only by virtue of his future death he is no more  and no less than a victim awaiting sacrifice a condemned man about to  be executed The sacrifice itself is not the first but a ritualized form of  the original outburst of violent unanimity   Although the king is required to eat disgusting concoctions and  commit all sorts of violent crimes there is no reason to associate his  performance with the avantgarde theater or to see him as a sort of  antihero of the contemporary counterculture The spirit behind these  rites has nothing in common with such modern phenomena Rather  than welcome the powers of evil with open arms the rites seek to  exorcise them The king must show himself worthy of his punish mentfully as worthy as the original outcast from whom the cere mony derives It is important to cultivate the future victims supposed  potential for evil to transform him into a monster of iniquitynot for  esthetic reasons but to enable him to polarize to literally draw to  himself all the infectious strains in the community and transform them  into sources of peace and fecundity The principle of this meta morphosis has its source in the sacrifice of the monarch and subse quently pervades his entire existence on earth The investiture hymn  of the Mossis Ouagadougous expresses with classic concision a dy namic formula for salvation that only my hypothesis of the surrogate  victim can render intelligible   You are a turd  You are a heap of refuse  You have come to kill us  You have come to save us14   The king has a genuine function identical to that of any sacrificial  victim He is the catalyst who converts sterile infectious violence into  positive cultural values The monarchy might be compared to the fac tories that convert household refuse into fertilizer In both cases the   13 H J Krige and J D Krige The Lovedu of Transvaal in African Worlds  London 1954   14 T Theuws Naitre et

full strength they  must be used with moderation and caution and on occasion be mixed  with neutral agents The king fertilizes a farmers field from a safe  distance if he passes too close the surface will be singed if he walks on  it a blight will ensue   The parallelism between the Oedipus myth and these African ob servances is striking There is no theme in the myth or the tragedy that  does not find an echo here In certain cases the regulations relating to  incest seem to reflect the double motif of infanticide and parricide as  in the formal edict that forever separates the king from his son In  other societies one can detect reflections of the other double motifs of  the myth Like the son of Laius the king of the Nyoros has two little  mothers and the chief of the Jukuns has two mistresses whom Luc  de Heusch compares to the Nyoro pair15   5 MoroNaba film by J Rouch and D Zahan Produced by Comitc du film  ethnolographique de 1IFAN Cited by Makarius Du roi magique au roi divin  p 685 This parallelism is undoubtedly rooted in the presence of a sacred monarchy  of the African type in archaic Greece Yet no matter how legitimate and even  necessary this historical hypothesis may be it does not really serve to explain the  Oedipus myth In order to explain the relationship between the myth ritual and  tragedy as well as its parallelism with the African observances we must have  perceived the real mechanism that hides behind all these cultural accretionsin  particular the sacred monarchy which can 4 by no means be considered the irre ducible element in the analysis We must grasp the role of the surrogate victim  that is the conclusion of a crisis of reciprocal violence brought about through  unanimous accord directed or redirected against a victim In Ambiguite et  renversement pp 127172 JeanPierre Vernant has brought together many  mythological and ritualistic details that forcefully suggest the inadequacy of certain  fashionable psychological assumptions and the obstacles they present to a true  appreciation of the scapegoatV role and associated phenomena   The polarity between the king and the scapegoat a polarity the tragedy situates  at the very heart of the figure of Oedipus was hardly invented by Sophocles  It is ingrained in the religious practices and social theories of the Greeks The  poet has lent it new meaning however in making it the symbol of mans  fundamental ambiguity If Sophocles chose the tyrannospbarrnakos to illustrate  what we have called the reversal theme it was because these two opposing  figures appear symmetrical and to some degree interchangeable Each regards  itself as an individual responsible for the collective salvation of the group In  the works of Homer and Hesiod it is the king an offspring of Zeus who is  responsible for the fertility of the soil the herds and the women As long as  he shows himself irreproachable annembn in the dispensing of justice his  people prosper but if he falters the whole community pays the penalty for the  failing of this one individual The gods then visit misfortune on oWlrmos and  lormos famine and plague The men kill each other the women cease to  bear children the earth remains sterile and the flocks and herds no longer re produce When such a divine calamity descends on a people their natural  recourse is to sacrifice their king For if the king is responsible for the com munitys fertility and this fertility ceases that indicates that the power invested  in him as sovereign has somehow become inverted his justice turns to crime  his integrity to corruption and the best aristos seems to be replaced by the  worst kakistos The legends of Lycurgus Athamas and Oinoclus therefore  involve as a means of putting the loimos to rout the lapidation of the king     The Origins of Myth and Ritual 109   Behind the Athenian pharmakos behind the Oedipus myth there is  real violence at work reciprocal violence brought to an end by the  unanimous slaughter of the surrogate victim In almost every case the  enthronement or renewal ritualsand in some cases the actual defini tive death of the monarchare accompanied by mock combats be tween two factions These ritual confrontations sometimes enlisting  the participation of the whole community recall the chaos and fac tionalism whose only cure lies in the surrogate victim And if this  violent treatment of a surrogate victim serves as a model everywhere  it is because it has actually proved effective in restoring peace and  unity Only the social utility of this collective violence can account for  a politicoritualistic scheme that consists not only of constantly repeat ing the process but also of making the surrogate victim the sole arbi trator of all conflicts proclaiming it a veritable incarnation of absolute  sovereignty   In many cases succession to the throne entails a ritual battle between  father and son or between sons Luc de Heusch offers a description of  such a struggle The death of the king triggers a war of succession a  war whose ritualistic character can hardly be underestimated The  princes reputedly employ their most potent magic medicines to elimi nate their fraternal rivals At the core of this royal magic contest in  Nkole appears the old theme of enemy brothers Factions congregate  around the various claimants and the surviving brother is accorded the  throne As we remarked earlier in a conflict whose course is no  longer strictly regulated by a predetermined model the ritualistic ele  his ritual murder or the sacrifice of his son But there are also instances where  a member of the community is delegated to assume the role of the unworthy  king the antisovereign The king then unloads on this inverted image of him self all his negative attributes We now have the true pharmakos the kings  double but in reverse He is similar to those mock kings who are crowned  at carnival time when everything is set topsyturvy and social hierarchies  turned upside down when sexual prohibitions are lifted and theft permitted  when servants take the place of their masters and women exchange clothing  with men when in short the throne is yielded only to the basest ugliest  most ridiculous and criminal of beings But once the carnival is over the anti king is expelled from the community or put to death and his disappearance  puts an end to all the disorder that his person served to symbolize for the  community and also to purge for it   Vernants observations on Oedipus and the African monarchies are equally applica ble to many other cases for they ultimately concern the ritualistic response to the  presence of violence Once we recognize the role of unanimity in the operation  of the surrogate victim it becomes clear that in these instances we are not dealing  with gratuitous elaborations of superstition That is why Sophocles version should  not be looked upon as something entirely new that adds a further dimension to  the myth but as a reduction the partial demolishing of its mythological meaning  both in regard to modern psychology and sociology and in regard to other ancient  myths The poet lends no new meaning to the royal scapegoat he simply draws  nearer the universal source of meanings     110 Violence and the Sacred   rnents disintegrate into actual events and it becomes impossible to dis tinguish history from ritual This confusion is in itself revealing A rite  retains its vitality only as long as it serves to channel political and social  conflicts of unquestionable reality in a specific direction On the other  hand it remains a rite only as long as it manages to restrict the con flictual modes of expression to rigorously determined forms   e4 WHEREVER WE POSSESS DETAILED DESCRIP tions of specific renewal rites we observe that they too follow the  general pattern of the sacrificial crisis incorporating its original vio lence These rites are to royalty as a whole what the microcosm is to  the macrocosm The royal rites of Incwala in Swaziland have received  particularly careful attention10   As the rites begin the king retires to his sacred enclosure where he  imbibes various noxious potions and commits incest with a tribal sister  These actions are intended to augment the kings silwane a term whose  literal translation is to be like a savage beast Although this attribute  is not the exclusive property of the king it serves to set him apart from  his subjects The kings sihvane is always superior to anyone elses  even that of his bravest warrior   During this preparatory period the people intone a hymn the  simemo which expresses their hatred of the king and their desire to see  him expelled from the community From time to time the monarch  more savagebeastly than ever puts in an appearance His nudity and  the black paint with wrhich he has decorated his body serve as a symbol  of defiance There then takes place a mock battle between the people  and the royal clan in which the very person of the king is at stake  Fortified in their turn with magic potions and swollen with silivane  though to a lesser extent than their chiefthe armed warriors encircle  the sacred enclosure and endeavor as it seems to take possession of the  king who is protected by his entourage   In the course of the rites presented here in abridged form a  symbolic execution of the king also occurs With a touch of his wand  the royal incarnation of violence transfers his own silwane to a cow  thus transforming the animal into a raging bull which is then put to  death As in the Dinka sacrifices the warriors hurl themselves all to gether and without weapons onto the beast belaboring it with their  fists   iT O Beidelman Swazi Royal Ritual Africa 36 1966373405 P A W  Cook The

between the king his entourage  the warriors and the rest of his subjects is temporarily efFaced This  loss of differences has nothing to do with fraternization Rather it is  the result of the violence that engulfs all the participants T O Beidel man defines this portion of the rites as a dissolving of distinctions11   Victor Turner describes the Incwala as a play of kingship in the  Shakespearean sense of the expression   The ceremony unleashes an increasing exaltation a dynamism that  draws its energy from the very forces it puts in play forces that  initially seem to claim the king as their victim but from which he  eventually emerges as the absolute ruler At first almost sacrificed him self the king then presides at rites which show him to be the sacrificer  par excellence There is nothing surprising about this duality it simply  confirms the role we attributed to the surrogate victim its ability to  master all violence Even when he is a victim the king remains the final  arbiter of the contest and can intervene at anv point He plays all the  roles and no form of violence no matter how extreme or eccentric is  foreign to him   At the height of the battle between the warriors and the king the  king withdraws once more to his enclosure He reemerges armed with  a gourd which he hurls at the shields of his assailants After this attack  the groups disband H Kupers native informants told him that in time  of war any warrior struck by the royal gourd would forfeit his life In  the light of this information the anthropologist suggests that we look  upon the warrior whom the king singles out to be struck by the gourd  as a sort of national scapegoat This amounts to seeing him as a double  for the king a man who symbolically dies in his place as the cow had  done earlier in the ceremony   The Incwala rites begin at the end of an old year and close at the  beginning of a new year A relationship exists between the crisis com memorated by the rites and the end of a temporal cycle The rites  follow certain natural rhythms but these rhythms can scarcely be  regarded as a prime factor in the ceremonies even if they occasionally  seem to overshadow the violence For it is the violence whose very  presence establishes the essential function of all myths and rituals to  disguise to divert and to banish disorder from the community At the  close of the ceremonies a great bonfire is lit and on it are consumed all  the pollutions accumulated in the course of the rites and in the course  of the past year A symbolism of cleansing and purification pervades all  the important stages of the ceremony   17 Beidelman Swazi Royal Ritual p 391 n 1     112 Violence and the Sacred   e4 TO BE PROPERLY UNDERSTOOD royal incest must  be perceived as part of a ritual pattern that is identical with the mon archy itself The king must be looked upon as a future sacrificial  object that is as the replacement for the surrogate victim Incest  then plays a relatively minor role in the proceedings Its purpose is to  augment the effectiveness of the sacrifice And although the sacrifice  directly linked as it is to spontaneous collective violence is perfectly  intelligible without reference to incest the incest is unintelligible  without reference to sacrifice   To be sure the sacrificial element can disappear completely while  the incest or incest symbolism persists This does not mean however  that the sacrifice is subsidiary to the incest or that the incest can be  considered without reference to the sacrifice Rather the participants  have moved so far from the origin of events that they now regard their  own rites from the same general perspective as Western observers one  is almost tempted to say Western voyeurs The incest persists  owing to its very strangeness In the collapse of ritualwhich in one  sense is not really a collapse since it prolongs and reinforces the orig inal delusionincest alone survives it alone is remembered when all  else has been forgotten The African monarchy has now been reduced  to a tourist attraction In addition modern ethnology has almost in variably isolated institutional incest from its context it consistently  fails to appreciate its meaning because it insists on viewing incest as an  autonomous event something so remarkable that it should have a sig nificance all its own without reference to the surrounding phenomena  Psychoanalysts perpetuate this error one might say they are its chief  perpetrators   It is by means of incest that the king assumes the mantle of royalty  but the act itself is royal only in its demanding the death of those  who commit it in its harkening back to the original victim This  becomes apparent when we turn to a rather remarkable exception in  the midst of those societies that prescribe royal incest namely a soci ety in which the practice is formally and absolutely forbidden One  might suppose that such a refusal simply entails a reversion to the  general rule that prohibits incest But matters are not that simple The  practice is not merely rejected and forbidden as it would be in most  societies but these measures are accompanied by extraordinary precau tions The monarchs entourage undertakes to remove all his close  relatives from his presence and he is forced to imbibe not fortifying  potions but debilitating ones All of which means of course that an  aura of incest surrounds the throne an aura no less strong than those in     The Origins of Myth and Ritual 113   the neighboring monarchies where royal incest is obligatory18 These  special precautionary measures are justified solely by the kings dan gerous vulnerability to this particular transgression Thus it might be  said that the basic criterion of royalty remains the same Even in a  society that formally excludes incest the king replaces an original  victim who is believed to have violated the rules of exogamy It is as  the heir and successor of this victim that the king is considered particu larly susceptible to incest The copy is assumed to have all the qualities  of the original   The general rule proscribing the practice of incest is here reaffirmed  but in such a peculiar manner that we can only regard it as an excep tion to the exception and classify it with the cultures that practice  royal incest The essential question is this Why is the repetition of an  incestuous actinvariably traced back to some original banished trans gressor some founding father or mythic hero of the community  regarded as salubrious by one society and noxious by its neighbor A  contradiction of this kind among communities whose religious out looks with the exception of their treatment of incest are so very  similar seems to defy all efforts at rational inquiry   The distribution of a religious theme such as royal incest throughout  a cultural milieu of a certain range and variety suggests that influ ences in the traditional sense of the word are at work The incest  theme cannot be original to each of these cultures that much seems  clear Does this mean that my general hypothesis no longer applies   I maintain that the original act of violence is the matrix of all ritual  and mythological significations Strictly speaking this is only true of  an act whose violence is absolute so to speak perfect completely  spontaneous extreme Between this instance of complete originality  and the mechanical repetition of rites at the other end of the scale we  can assume the existence of an infinite number of intermediary forms   18 The Nioka impose continence on their chief for the rest of his life He is  obliged to send away all the women of his household wear a penis sheath at all  times and take sedative drugs Among the Njumbas of Kasai the chief wife the  first wife of the chief is required to take medications that produce not only  sterility but a complete suppression of the menstrual cycle The excessive charac ter of these customs can be readily explained in terms of the conflict between a  tradition of royal incest and the desire to allow no breach of the exogamic pro hibition The Pendes in fact regard any hint of royal incest with great severity  and they dismissed a chieftain from his position because he had once as a warrior  treated his sister for an abdominal abscess You

fact that certain religious and cultural themes pervade a vast area  does not exclude the possibility that truly spontaneous collective vio lence working through one of the intermediary forms and endowed  with real if limited creative powers on the mythic and religious  level might occur in many places This would explain the many vari ants of the same myth the same cults from locality to locality and  also the claim made by various places to be the birthplace of the same  god   It should be noted however that even though the myths and rituals  are susceptible to infinite variation in detail they all revolve around a  few major themes one of which is incest As soon as a community  begins to regard an isolated individual as responsible for a sacrificial  crisisthat is responsible for the disintegration of distinctions within  the communityit follows that this same individual is accused of vio lating societys most fundamental rules the rules of kinship In short  the individual is considered essentially incestuous in nature The  theme of the incestuous outcast is not universal but it is found in  many widely scattered cultural areas The fact that the theme turns up  spontaneously in so many different places is not incompatible with the  notion of cultural diffusion within a broad geographical expanse   The surrogatevictim hypothesis offers a means of traversing the  vast theoretical terrain between the passivity and excessively rigid con tinuity of the diffusionist theories on the one hand and the equally  rigid discontinuity of modern formalism on the other While not ex cluding borrowings from other cultures my hypothesis confers on  these borrowed elements a large degree of autonomy within their new  setting This accounts for the strange contradiction of the strict re quirement and the formal prohibition of royal incest existing side by  side in neighboring societies In each instance we can see the same  incest theme but reinterpreted in terms of local experience   The ritualistic imagination strives to repeat the original generative  process The unanimity that regulates pacifies and reconciles sup plants the opposite situation displacing the paroxysm of violence that  divides destroys and levels The transition from disruptive violence to  order and peace is almost instantaneous The two different faces of the  primordial experience are juxtaposed unanimity is attained in the  course of a brief and terrifying meeting of opposites All sacrificial  rites then reproduce certain forms of violence and appropriate certain  associations that seem more suitable to the sacrificial crisis itself than to  its cure Incest is an example In societies where it is an accepted  practice royal incest is regarded as a means of salvation and in con sequence an institution to be carefully preserved Such a reaction is  perfectly intelligible     The Origins of Myth and Ritual 115   The primaryin fact the solepurpose of the rite is to prevent the  return of the sacrificial crisis Incest is a product of this crisis and even  when it is attributed to the surrogate victim it still signifies the crisis it  retains a sinister connotation We can understand therefore that the  ritualistic mind might refuse to consider incest as a contribution to the  communitys salvation even in its association with the surrogate victim  It might persist in regarding incest even when committed by the  representative and heir of the original victim as the ultimate act of  evil capable of plunging the community into a highly contagious form  of violence   Incest then is simply another aspect of the affliction that the rites  are designed to prevent But they attempt to prevent it by means of a  cure that is intimately associated with the most virulent form of the  affliction The ritualistic mind thus finds itself obliged to separate what  cannot be separated and the solution must ultimately be an arbitrary  one The ritualistic mind is perhaps more willing than we are to admit  that good and evil are simply two aspects of the same reality but  eventually it must distinguish between them even in the ritualistic  framework where there are fewer differences than in any other area  of human culture a distinction between the two must be apparent  The purpose of the rite is to consolidate this difference newly restored  after the terrible undifferentiation of the crisis There is nothing arbi trary or imaginary about the difference between violence and nonvio lence but men always treat it as a difference within a process that is  violent from beginning to end That is how the rite is made possible  The rite selects a certain form of violence as good as necessary to  the unity of the community and sets up in opposition to it another  sort of violence that is deemed bad because it is affiliated to violent  reciprocity In the same way the rite can designate certain forms of  incest as goodfor example royal incestand others as bad It  can equally well decide that all forms of incest are bad and refuse to  admit even royal incest among those actions which if not actually  sacrificial in character are still capable of contributing to the sacrificial  powers of the monarch   Given the fundamental importance to mankind of the transforma tion of bad violence into good and the equally fundamental inability of  men to solve the mystery of this transformation it is not surprising  that men are doomed to ritual nor is it surprising that the resulting  rites assume forms that are both highly analogous and highly diverse   That the ritualistic imagination can confront royal incest and derive  two diametrically opposed solutions from it demonstrates both the  arbitrary and the fundamental character of the difference between  good that is sacrificial and bad violence In each culture the inverse     116 Violence and the Sacred   solution can be felt behind each chosen solution In societies where it is  an accepted and even an obligatory practice incest even royal incest  still retains a sinister connotation it invites punishment and justifies the  death of the king But in societies where it is forbidden incest has a  certain beneficial quality in that the king is perceived as having a  special predilection for incest and nothing closely associated to the  king can be completely bad since the king brings unity and salvation to  the community   iMthough incest may have contradictory associations it is not simply  a pawn on a structural chessboard to be moved about at will Nor can  it be added or subtracted from the cultural picture simply to satisfy  the whims of intellectual fashion We must take care that a formal  structuralistic approach does not strip it completely of its dramatic  impact nor must we permit psychoanalysis to pass it ofF as the mean ing of meanings        IT IS IN THE DOMAIN of general anthropology that  orthodox Freudianism is most vulnerable There is no formal psycho analytical explanation of royal incest not even of the Oedipus myth  no explanation of the interesting similarities between the Oedipus  myth and the African monarchies With brilliant intuition Freud  pointed the way toward patricide and incest but his disciples failed to  follow his lead Instead of conceding the impotence of psychoanalysis  in dealing with the subject most scholars even those hostile to psycho analysis tacitly acknowledge its privilege to deal with anything  remotely concerned with incest Nobody can approach the question of  royal incest without saluting the stately ghost of Freud Yet psycho analysis has never said and never can say anything decisive on the  subject of royal incest anything that could add substantially to our  understanding or for that matter approach the Master at his best   The almost total absence of the incest motif in latenineteenth century Western culture led Freud to conclude that all human society  is warped by a universal desire universally suppressed to commit ma ternal incest The presence of incest in the mythology and rituals of  primitive peoples seemed to Freud an irrefutable proof of his hypothe sis But psychoanalysis has never managed to explain why the absence  of incest in one culture has exactly the same significance as the pres ence of incest in another There is no doubt that Freuds hypothesis  was mistaken but he often had good reasons for being wrong whereas  those who denounce his errors often have the wrong reasons for being  right   Freud perceived that the incest and patricide motifs of the Oedipus  myth concealed something essential to the understanding of all aspects     The Origins of Myth and Ritual 111   of culture The cultural context in which he functioned led him to  believe that the crimes attributed to the surrogate victim were indeed  the hidden desires of all men the secret source of human conduct  Some of the cultural phenomena of the period could be at least par tially explained in terms of the absence of patricidal or incestuous  manifestations Psychoanalysis could not claim equal success as limited  as this success might be in its approach to myths and religion When  patricide and incest are openly displayed it is hard to see what it is  they are hidingsome still better hidden instance of incest or patri cide perhaps Even if one concedes such a theory it in no way serves  to explain the other themes of the myth or even incest itself when it  appears in a real form within a ritualistic framework19   Until some other approach succeeds where psychoanalysis has failed  the claims of psychoanalysis will continue to influence us However  once the Freudian interpretation of mythological and ritual incest has  been replaced by another explanation at once very close to and very  far removed from the Freudian viewpoint many thematic aspects of  the issue will suddenly become clear and we will have good cause to  believe that Freuds theory has finally had its day   In the African monarchies as in the Oedipus myth incestmaternal  or otherwiseis not primary matter absolute and irreducible It is an  allusion that can readily be translated into other terms The same is  true of patricide or any of the crimes perversions and monstrosities  with which mythology abounds All these motifs and others as well  serve to conceal and disguise rather than reveal the violent elimination  of differences It is this particular violence that is the suppressed matter  of the myths not suppressed desire but terror terror of absolute  violence And who would deny that far stronger than desire in fact   19 The most favorable situation for psychoanalytic theories of this sort would  be the total absence of incest and patricide from the entire corpus of mythology  and ritual However psychoanalysis could also adjust to its constant presence to  a continual intrusion of incest and patricide motifs The truth lies between these  extremes Patricide figures in mythology and ritual but hardly more than any  other type of criminal activity the same applies to incest Among the different  kinds of incest maternal incest will at most play the role of primus inter pares  unless it is replaced by the incestuous relationship with a sister or some other  relative but never so fully or so systematically that one can attribute it merely to  a reflex of the unconscious   A statistical survey has been made dealing with violence between relations in  myths of the Oedipus type These myths were drawn from some fifty selected  cultures more or less evenly distributed within the six broad cultural regions  defined by Murdock Clyde Kluckhohn sums up the results One can make a  good case for antagonism against close relativesusually of the same sex as a  prominent motif and a fair case for physical violence against such relatives But  neither parricide nor Raglans regicide motifs will stand up literally without a  great deal of farfetched interpretation Recurrent Themes in Myths and  Mythmaking pp 5354     118 Violence and the Sacred   the only force that can snuff out desire is that nameless but irresistible  terror   Widespread patricide and incest signify the final stages of the sacri ficial crisis Limited to a single individual patricide and incest shift the  whole burden of the crisis onto a surrogate victim The hidden basis of  myths is not sexual it cannot be for that motif is openly revealed  Nonetheless sexuality is important insofar as it stimulates violence and  provides occasions for it to vent its force Like other natural phenom ena sexuality is a real presence in myths In fact it plays a more  important role in them than does nature itself but a role that is not  truly decisive Sexuality becomes almost completely explicit in the  incest motif There it is associated with a purely individual violence  one however that still masks the collective violence This violence  would surely wipe out the community were it not for the religious  delusion that the surrogate victim provides   The theory that mythological themes serve to express mans fear of  natural phenomena has in the twentieth century given way to the idea  that these same themes conceal mans fear of the purely sexual and  incestuous nature of his desires The two theories are themselves  mythic like the other theories we have discussed they function within  the context of myth and help to perpetuate the delusions of myth  However the two theories should not be put on the same footing  Freud is less mythic than his predecessors sex is more involved in  human violence than are thunder and earthquakes closer to the hidden  sources of mythic elaboration Naked or pure sexuality is direcdy  connected to violence It is the final veil shielding violence from sight  at the same time it is the beginning of violences revelation Histori cally these two aspects of sexuality often dominate in turn periods of  sexual liberation often precede some violent outburst This is true  even in the chronological sequence of Freuds own work The dy namism of this work tends to transcend the initial pansexualism to  engage itself in the ambiguous enterprise of Totem and Taboo or the  radical concept of the death wish We can thus look on Freuds  work as a step toward the revelation of something far more profound  than the theory of suppressed desires a theory whose inadequacy he  may have dimly perceived toward in fact the absolute violence still  concealed by a certain delusion the nature of which remains in the  broad sense sacrificial     a3 Chapter Five   ionvsus   y f  y j l ALMOST EVERY SOCIETY HAS FESTIVALS that      1 have retained a ritualistic character over the centuries Of   articular interest to the modern inquirer are observances involving the  leliberate violation of established laws for example celebrations in  yhich sexual promiscuity is not only tolerated but prescribed or in  virich incest becomes the required practice   Such violations must be viewed in their broadest context that of the  verall elimination of differences Family and social hierarchies are  emporarily suppressed or inverted children no longer respect their  Darents servants their masters vassals their lords This motif is re jected in the esthetics of the holidaythe display of clashing colors  he parading of transvestite figures the slapstick antics of piebald  fools For the duration of the festival unnatural acts and outrageous  behavior are permitted even encouraged   As one might expect this destruction of differences is often accom panied by violence and strife Subordinates hurl insults at their superi ors various social factions exchange gibes and abuse Disputes rage in  the midst of disorder In many instances the motif of rivalry makes its  appearance in the guise of a contest game or sporting event that has  assumed a quasiritualistic cast Work is suspended and the celebrants  give themselves over to drunken revelry and the consumption of all  the food amassed over the course of many months   I have no doubt that these festivities commemorate a sacrificial crisis  It may seem strange to memorialize a traumatic event in such an up roarious manner but the explanation lies ready to hand The specifi cally festive aspects of the celebration those that most effectively  capture the attention that dominate the spectacle and that are the  only ones to survive the evolutionary transformations of the festival  these aspects have nothing to do with the festivals underlying cause  The fundamental purpose of the festival is to set the stage for a sacrifi cial act that marks at once the climax and the termination of the  festivities Roger Caillois has pointed out the sacrificial origin of fes  119     120 Violence and the Sacred   tivals1 If the crisis brought on by the loss of distinctions and the  subsequent advent of reciprocal violence can be celebrated in such a  jubilant fashion it is because these holocausts are seen in retrospect as  the initial stages of a cathartic process The beneficial character of the  generative unanimity tends to be projected onto the past affecting the  initial impression of the crisis and making it seem other than it was  The violent dismissal of distinctions now acquires a favorable connota tion which will eventually manifest itself as a festive display   I have already advanced a number of interpretations that may prove  relevant to the subject of festivals For example ritual incest ultimately  acquires a beneficial aspect that seems to be almost wholly independent  of its sacrificial quality In certain societies the aristocrats and even the  artisans have recourse to ritual incest more or less furtively to bring  them good luck before a difficult or hazardous undertaking The rites  performed during the enthronement of certain African monarchs or in  the course of renewal ceremonies often resemble festival practices  Conversely in festivals in which the monarch plays no direct role we  encounter a substitute kingsometimes a king of foolswho is him self nothing more than a sacrificial victim endowed with sacral privi leges at the conclusion of the festivities he or his representative will  be sacrificed The kings sovereigntyreal or imagined permanent or  temporaryseems to derive from an original generative act of vio lence inflicted on a surrogate victim   The function of the festival is no different from the function of  other sacrificial rites As Emile Durkheim perceived the festival re vitalizes the cultural order by reenacting its conception reproducing  an experience that is viewed as the source of health and abundance  reenacting in fact the moment when the fear of falling into inter minable violence is most intense and the community is therefore most  closely drawn together   Primitive peoples regard their cultural tradition as a fragile and pre cious inheritance to be carefully nurtured and protected from any  change for change could only serve to damage it perhaps mortally  The skepticism and resentment we moderns feel toward taboos of any  kind which feelings we tend to assume are shared by primitive peo ples play no part in their festivities The oftencited syndrome of  release of tensions or that muchridden hobbyhorse of psycho sociologists the necessary outlet has relevance only to a single  aspect of the ritual process and an exclusive emphasis on these syn dromes distorts the original spirit of the ritual   Festivals are based on the assumption that there is a direct link  1 Roger Caillois Man and the Sacred trans Meyer Baxash Glencoe 111 1959   chap 4 pp 97127     Dionysus 121   between the sacrificial crisis and its resolution The crisis is inseparable  from its happy ending and becomes itself a cause for jubilation But  this interpretation is not the only one possible As we have already  noticed in the case of royal incest religious thinking on the relation ship between the crisis and its conclusion can result in two divergent  viewpoints Either it is the continuity between crisis and conclusion  that strikes the imagination or it is the rupture in each instance the  resulting interpretation must be both partially true and partially false  Yet religious thinking tends to adopt one or another of the two solu tions and cling to it for dear lifeeven if at the outset the choice  could easily have gone the other way   It can be assumed almost a priori that certain societies will opt for the  second solution the one that emphasizes the rupture between the crisis  and the founding violence In such cases another kind of festival will  arise one that in comparison with the festival we have been describ ing might perhaps be called an antifestival The rites of sacrificial  expulsion are not preceded by a period of frenzied anarchy but by an  extreme austerity and an increased rigor in the observance of all inter dicts Extraordinary precautions are taken to prevent the community  from falling prey once again to reciprocal violence   In fact both solutions can be observed In some societies we en counter ritual occasions that resemble festivalsthere is the same  periodicity the same interruption of normal activities the same rites of  sacrificial expulsionand yet are so very different from festivals that  they constitute a vexing problem for ethnologists one similar to the  enigma of royal incest which is accepted in some societies and forbid den in others Far from being temporarily suspended in the antifestival  all cultural prohibitions are strongly reinforced   The rites of the Swazi Incwala correspond closely to the definition  of the antifestival Throughout the period of observance all sexual  activity including the most legitimate is forbidden Sleeping late in  the morning is regarded as a crime and physical contact between  individuals is to be avoided even physical contact with ones own  body the celebrants are not supposed to wash or to scratch them selves A threat of imminent pollutionthat is of violencehangs  over the entire community All singing and loud noise are prohibited  Children are scolded if they grow noisy at play   In The Golden Bough Frazer offers a fine example of an antifestival  For several weeks in the year the Cape tribe on the Gold Coast permit  no sound of tomtoms or musket fire Public conversations are forbid den If a dispute arises and voices are raised the contesting parties are  summoned before the chieftain who deals out stiff fines to everyone  involved To avoid arguments over strayed livestock all lost animals     122 Violence and the Sacred   become the property of their finders and the original owners are  obliged to relinquish all claim   It seems clear that such measures are intended to prevent the out break of widespread violence Frazer offers no explanation for them  but his anthropological intuition far superior to his theorizing  prompted him to classify these practices under the rubric of festivals  The logic of the antifestival is as strict as that of the festival The  goal is to reproduce the beneficial effects of violent unanimity while  abbreviating as much as possible the terrible preliminarieswhich in  the case of the antifestival are perceived in a negative light The  longer the interval between any two purifying rituals the greater the  danger of a violent explosion Impurities accumulate and in the period  immediately preceding the celebration of the rite a period saturated  with the memory of the sacrificial crisis everyone moves with extreme  caution It is as if the community had suddenly become an arsenal piled  high with gunpowder The Saturnalia has been transformed into its  opposite the feast changed to a fast but the purpose of the ritual  remains the same   In addition to the festival and the antifestival one finds as might  have been expected mixed ceremonies resulting from a more com plex more nuanced concept of the relationship between the crisis and  the restoration of order a concept that takes into account both the  continuity and the discontinuity between them In some instances at  least these variations can be seen as a late development resulting from  the sheer remoteness of the original violence that is from the cumula tive effect of mythological elaboration   All too often we go astray when examining the nature of the festival  and allow our attention to be diverted to secondary aspects Under  these circumstances the events hidden behind the rite become increas ingly inaccessible and the rites unity of purpose splinters into many  incompatible segments At the very point when the religious aspects of  the rite have begun to reflect an ignorance equal to our own the rite  suddenly appears to have a timely and original function whereas this  function is in fact belated and derivative The asceticism and mortifica tions of the antifestivals seems very far removed from the kind of  activity we associate with a festival We fail to grasp that they share a  common origin and that in those communities where the ritual has  retained its greatest vitality they often achieve a dialectical equi librium The more the rites diverge from their true function the more  differentiated they appear and the more interesting they become to  scholars who can sort them out in different categories   Modern scholarship notably since Frazer is no longer unaware that  certain festivals entailed human sacrifice Nonetheless we are still far     Dionysus 123   lorn suspecting that the distinctive traits of this practice and their  nnumerable variations can be traced back directly or indirectly to a  generative act of collective violence a liberating gesture of mob anger  The origin of the festival can still be discerned even in those instances  where sacrificial immolation has been eliminated from the proceedings  The disappearance of the sacrificial event may lead to new rites whose  sacrificial character is easily identifiablerites of exorcism for ex ample These rites occupy the same place as the vanished sacrifice and  even when they are not directly linked to sacrifice they serve the same  function in the ceremonies In short they can be said to be a replace ment for the sacrifice   What is the correct procedure for ridding a person or place of devils  and evil spirits Often it is a matter of shouting clanging weapons or  cooking vessels and beating the air with a stick Nothing seems more  natural than to take a broom to the devilif that is one is stupid  enough to believe in his existence The modern intellectual the liber ated Frazerian therefore concludes that primitives liken the spirit of  evil to some great beast that takes to its heels when frightened The  rationalistic mind does not bother with customs that seem not only  puerile in conception but lacking all reason   In this case as in many others a complacent intellect and the seeming  naturalness of the circumstances can serve to conceal their most  interesting aspects In principle the act of exorcism is an act of vio lence perpetrated against the devil or his associates In some festivals  this terminal violence is preceded by mock combat between the exor cists themselves We recognize here a pattern repeated in many sacri ficial rites the actual immolation is preceded by ritual disputes  between the sacrificers in which the violence is to some extent simu lated This phenomenon of mock combat must stem in all instances  from the same general source   In an example adduced by Frazer the young men of the village go  from house to house pausing at each to perform the rites of exorcism  The tour begins with a quarrel about which house to visit first hs a  good positivist Frazer takes care to include even those details that do  not fit neatly into his own scheme for this reason alone he deserves our  gratitude and respect The preliminary quarrel is a reminder of the  sacrificial crisis the sacrifice or exorcism that follows emulates the unan imous violence which is in effect promptly grafted onto the reciprocal  violence and distinguished from it only by its miraculous results   At the conclusion of the quarrel unanimity is achieved and the  moment has come for the surrogate victim for the performance of the  sacrifice The object of the quarrel is ostensibly the sacrifice itself  that is the selection of the victim In the course of the quarrel each     124 Violence and the Sacred   disputant strives to put in a final word reducing his antagonist to  silence each wants to get in the decisive blow the one that permits no  response and that will therefore serve as a model for the rite itself   Greek legends often contain vague reference to a sacrificea human  sacrificeoffered bv a community city or army to some god The  persons involved agree on the need for such a sacrifice but disagree on  the choice of victim To understand the situation the investigator must  reverse the order of events First comes the violence spontaneous and  senseless then comes the sacrificial explanation genuinely sacrificial in  that it conceals the senseless and basically intolerable aspect of the  violence The sacrificial explanation is rooted in an act of terminal  violence violence that can only be labeled sacrificial retrospectively  because it brought all hostilities to an end These stories may represent  the minimal form of mythological fabrication A collective murder  that brings about the restoration of order imposes a kind of ritualistic  framework on the savage fury of the group all of whose members are  out for one anothers blood Murder becomes sacrifice the angry free forall that preceded it is transformed into a ritual dispute over the  choice of the most suitable victim one that satisfies the piety of the  faithful or has been selected by the god In effect the real question  behind these preliminaries is Who will kill whom   The dispute concerning the first dwelling to be exorcised screens the  same confiictual process leading to the violent resolution of the crisis  Exorcism represents the last chain in a series of reprisals   Having succumbed to reciprocal violence the celebrants as a group  vent their fury on the empty air We see here manifested a truth  common to all rites but never more clearly displayed than in this type  of exorcism Ritual violence awakens no hostility confronts no antag onist as long as their blows are directed as a group against an insub stantial presence which for excellent reasons shows no tendency to  retaliate in kind the exorcists are not likely to resume their quarrel  And here the rite reveals its origin and function The unanimity at tained through the intervention of the surrogate victim must not be  lost The community stands united before the onslaught of evil spir its and remains faithful to its vow to reject mutual hostility The rite  reaffirms and reinforces this resolution And religious thought returns  again and again to that supreme wonder that last word of violence  which is all the more precious for being pronounced so late in the day  Sacrifice is the boon worthy above all others of being preserved cele brated and memorialized reiterated and reenacted in a thousand dif ferent forms for it alone can prevent transcendental violence from  turning back into reciprocal violence the violence that really hurts     Dionysus 125   setting man against man and threatening the total destruction of the  community   43 THIS GENERAL THEORY of the sacrificial crisis and  violent unanimity seems to clarify aspects of the festival that have  hitherto remained obscure As the ritualistic aspects of the festival  dwindle it degenerates into a communal letting off of steamthe  very idea of the festival held dear by modern scholars The gradual loss  of ritualistic structure and the constantly increasing misunderstandings  surrounding the festival seem to go hand in hand The disintegration of  myths and rituals and indeed of religious thought in general leads not  to genuine demythologizing but to the outbreak of a new sacrificial  crisis   The joyous peaceful facade of the deritualized festival stripped of  any reference to a surrogate victim and its unifying powers rests on  the framework of a sacrificial crisis attended by reciprocal violence  That is why genuine artists can still sense that tragedy lurks some where behind the bland festivals the tawdry utopianism of the leisure  society The more trivial vulgar and banal holidays become the  more acutely one senses the approach of something uncanny and ter rifying The theme of holidaygonewrong dominates Fellinis films  and has recently surfaced in various different forms in the work of  many other artists   The holidaygonewrong serves nicely to symbolize decadence As  an artistic motif it is rich in fruitful paradoxes What is more it is a  very real part of the scene in any decadent society To ascertain this  we have only to look at the festal practices of obviously failing soci eties such as the Yanomamo who are torn apart by perpetual civil war  or even more strikingly of societies in the final stages of disintegration  such as the Kaingang The festival as celebrated in these societies has  lost all its ritual characteristics it has gone wrong in the sense that it  has reverted to its violent origins Instead of holding violence in check  the ceremonies inaugurate a new cycle of revenge By a process of  inversion that can befall all rites and that we have already had occasion  to observe in the case of sacrificial rites the festival ceases to function  as a preventive measure and lends its support to the forces of destruc tion   The killing was to be done in traditional Kaingang style they the  future victims were to be invited to a festa made to drink and then  slaughtered Although the Kaingang associate festas with quarreling and  murder they never refused an invitation to one even though they knew  their lives were in danger One might imagine that at a festa where large     126 Violence and the Sacred   sections of the tribe came together to enjoy themselves the bonds of  kinship would be renewed and strengthened and old attachments of man  for man would draw new warmth from the general good feeling   Although this was true of some Kaingang festas they were as often  the scene of violent quarreling and disruption as they were of friend liness and solidarity The men and women got drunk and the men  boasted to their children of their invulnerability and their deeds of  blood The men told their waikayu hubris walking about shaking  either clubs or lances slashing at the air crying out the deeds they had  done and the murders they would yet commit As the beer and the excite ment mounted to their heads they turned on their neighbors and quarreled  with them because they suspected them of adultery with their wives or  because they themselves had had affairs with their neighbors wives and  themselves felt suspected and hated  Kaingang folklore abounds in accounts of festivals that turn into  massacres and the Kaingang expression We shall make beer for him  has decidedly sinister connotations   e4 LET US NOW APPLY our newfound concept of the  festival to the myth of Dionysus as portrayed in Euripides tragedy  The Bacchae This analysis will concern itself with issues referred to in  the discussion of the Oedipus mvth I hope it will help to clarify my  thesis of the role of violence while also directing attention to new7   problems of significance  A bacchanal is a festival in the sense just defined it displays all the   characteristics previously discussed The Bacchae begins as a ritual  bacchanal The poet underlines the destruction of distinctions as the  god sweeps away all the barriers that usually divide mortals wealth  age sex and so on Everyone is called on to worship Dionysus the  chorus proclaims that graybeards will now mingle with youths  women will be on a par with men   The bacchanal portrayed by Euripides involves the women of  Thebes Having established his worship in Asia Dionysus arrives in his  native city in the guise of a young disciple of his own cult who exerts a  potent influence over almost everyone who encounters him Seized by  the spirit of the god Dionysuss own aunt Agaue his cousin Ino and  all the women of Thebes desert hearth and home to wander the slopes  of Mount Cithaeron celebrating the first bacchanal   Idyllic at first the bacchantes revel soon becomes a bloodthirsty  nightmare The delirious women hurl themselves indiscriminately on  men and beasts Only Pentheus king of Thebes and son of Agaue   2 Henry jungle People pp 5657     Dionysus 121   persists in denying the divinity of his cousin Like Tiresias and Creon  in Oedipus the Kiig Pentheus is an outsider who before succumbing  to the universal frenzy lucidly defines the situation I have just re turned from my travels to hear news of the strange illness that afflicts  our city   The strange illness is clearly the sacrificial crisis It has struck with  lightning speed inciting its victims to irrational acts The sacrificial  crisis makes no distinction between those who submit to its demands  out of prudence or opportunismlike the two old menand the only  man who has the boldness to reject itthe unfortunate Pentheus  Whether one chooses to fight or to submit violence triumphs   Throughout the tragedy the Bacchic spirit is presented as indistin guishable from the infectious evil Pentheus rebukes his grandfather  who has attempted to persuade him to join in worshiping the god Do  not breathe your infection on me go and play the bacchant The  Dionysiac outbreak spells the disintegration of social institutions and  the collapse of the cultural order both of which disasters are dramati cally symbolized by the destruction of the royal palace at the climax of  the action It is futile to attempt to restrain the god of violence Pen theus tries to imprison the defiant youth whose form Dionysus has  assumed but even as everything around him is engulfed in flame the  god steps forth unharmed from the ruins   The Bacchae takes as its subject a festival that goes wrong And we  will hardly be surprised at this unpleasant turn of events when we  consider that this bacchanal is none other than the original bacchanal  that is the sacrificial crisis The tragedy seems to offer strong evidence  in support of my theory of the meaning of festivals It traces the  festival back to its violent beginnings back to its origins in reciprocal  violence Euripides subjects the myth and worship of Dionysus to the  same sort of treatment that Sophocles applied to the Oedipus myth He  brings into plav the conflictual symmetry behind the mythological  message and as with Oedipus behind the ritea message that con ceals this symmetry at least as much as it displays it   The playwrights task was made easier because the bacchanal per petuates an essential aspect of the sacrificial crisis the destruction of  differences Beginning as a gesture of harmony the Dionysiac elimina tion of distinctions rapidly degenerates into a particularly virulent  form of violent nondifferentiation The abolishment of sexual differ ences which appears in the ritual bacchanal as a celebration of love and  brotherhood becomes in the tragedy an act of hostility The women  take up the most violent masculine activities hunting and warfare  They deride men for their weakness and femininity Dionysus in the     128 Violence and the Sacred   guise of a longhaired adolescent personally takes a hand in fomenting  the disorder Pentheus having reproached the god for his effeminate  appearance is seized bv the desire to disguise himself in womans dress  so that he can spy on the bacchantes on the slopes of Mount Cithaeron   We also find in The Bacchae reference to that loss of distinction  between man and beast that is always linked to violence The bac chantes hurl themselves on a herd of cattle which they mistake for  prying men and tear them apart with their bare hands And Pentheus  mad with rage imprisons a bull in his stable in the belief that he has  captured Dionysus himself Agaue commits the inverse error when  the bacchantes discover her son Pentheus spying on them she mistakes  him for a young lion and strikes the first blow to kill him   Another difference that tends to disappear in the course of the trag edy is the seemingly indelible distinction between man and godin  this instance between Pentheus and Dionysus There is no aspect of  Dionysus that fails to find a reflection in Pentheus Dionysus is a dual  figure On the one hand there is the Dionysus of the Maenads the  defender of divine and human laws the jealous guardian of legality on  the other there is the subversive agentprovocateur of the tragedy the  figure we have considered above This same duality can be seen in  Pentheus The king of Thebes introduces himself to us as a pious  conservative a guardian of traditional values Yet the chorus de nounces him as a bold lawbreaker whose blasphemy exposes the city to  divine retribution There is no doubt that Pentheus contributes to the  chaos he claims to oppose He dons the garb of a bacchant and becomes  possessed by Dionysus that is by violencea violence that eliminates  all distinctions between creatures whether men or gods through  the paradoxical means of fierce antagonism   The characteristics of each protagonist are all reproduced to a de gree in the other For example the divinity of Dionysus is counter balanced by a secret humanity implied by his appearance as a long haired youth Similarly the humanity of Pentheus is counterbalanced  if not bv divinity at least by a delusion of divinity revealed in the  superhuman claims that accompany his final submission to the Di onysiac spirit Could I not lift up on my shoulders Gthaeron and all  its groves w7ith all the reveling bacchantes   In the Dionysiac frenzy all differences between man and god tend to  disappear If there is a voice of Dionysiac orthodoxy in the play it can  only be that of the Lvdian Maenads who address us in unequivocal  terms Godinspired madness has made each celebrant another Diony sus The Lvdian chorus declares Who leads the dance becomes a  Bromios   It has been said that the delirium of Pentheus and the Theban bac    Dionysus 129   chantes is due to a culpable hubris whereas everything relating to  Dionysus and his Maenads is truly divine Even the worst forms of  violence are legitimate because god is god and man is man There is  some apparent truth in that As far as the overall plot of the play is  concerned the difference between man and god is never lost sight of  in fact it is strongly proclaimed at the beginning and end of the  tragedy Yet in the middle all differences mingle and dissolve includ ing the distinction between human and divine   As we have seen tragic inspiration leads to the same results in The  Bacchae as in Oedipus the Kiig Mythological and ritual values are  abolished by reciprocal violence The subjective nature of all differ ences is exposed We are compelled to confront a vital question per taining to myth and the cultural order Sophocles stopped just short of  framing this question and concludes by reaffirming the compromised  mythological values Euripides follows the same procedure in The  Bacchae The symmetry is so implacably applied that in the end it  dissolves the difference between man and god Divinity becomes noth ing more than a prize in the struggle between two rivals You know     how happy you are when a great crowd greets you at your doors  and all the city glorifies the name of Pentheus Bacchus also loves such  honors I am sure    In any case at the end of the play the uniqueness of the deity is  reaffirmed and in terrifying fashion It is made abundantly clear that  no real contest ever existed between the omnipotent Dionysus and the  culpably weak Pentheus The triumph of difference once again shields  from sight the recently exposed tragic symmetry Once again tragedy  seems to oscillate between audacity and indecision In the case of  Sophocles the conflict between the symmetry of the tragic action and  the dissymetry of the mythological content is our only reason for  believing that the poet knowingly or unknowingly recoiled before an  act of even greater audacity In the case of The Bacchae the same  textual conflict is present and we are led by the same process to a  similar conclusion Euripides too backed off from commiting an act  of even greater audacity But this time the backing off is not per formed in silence His tragedies contain numerous passages whose  emphatic tone and repetition of theme clearly mark them as expres sions of the poets decision to retreat and his attempts to justify himself   Human wisdom is not wisdom and to aspire to more than mans due is  to shorten life is to sacrifice the fruit at hand for what is out of reach  I think it is sheer madness or plain stupidity to act in such a manner     Keep heart and mind aloof from overreaching intellects  The beliefs and practices common to the common man are good enough  for me     130 Violence and the Sacred   Scholars are far from agreement on the interpretation of such pas sages and much of the modern debate on Euripides centers on this  problem It may be that the whole question has been falsified by a  postulate implicitly accepted by all the commentators This postulate  relates to the type of knowledge the poet has declined to confront We  have taken it for granted that such knowledge cannot be unknown to  us the idea that anyone so remote from modern thought as Eu ripides could have perceived a danger wholly unsuspected by us could  have anticipated a truth whose existence has escaped us completely  hardly seems worth consideration   Modern critics are convinced that Euripides drew back before that  same skepticism of which they are themselves the proud proponents  an intellectual viewpoint that denies the existence of a real basis for  religion and declares the whole institution purely imaginary Eu ripides they suggest hesitated from conventional propriety or simple  prejudice to acknowledge that religion was nothing more than mystifi cation an illusion specifically designed to offer consolation or impose  restraints Timidity kept him from acknowledging that religion was a  figment of the imagination   The modern intellectual is a romantic soul who likes to think of  himself as the boldest iconoclast in history7 At times he cannot but  challenge the high place accorded Euripides by tradition and wonder  whether the poet is not essentially too bourgeois in spirit to warrant  such esteem   But Euripides speaks less in terms of religious faith in the modern  sense than in terms of the transgressing of limits of the fearsome  knowledge that exists beyond these limits We do not seem to be  dealing in his case with a simple choice between belief and disbelief  two equally abstract concepts Something else is at play something  more to the point than sterile religious scepticism This something else  still to be discerned is nonetheless near at hand in the text of The  Bacchae   k THE MURDER OF PENTHEUS serves as both culmi nation and resolution of a crisis provoked by the god himself in  revenge for the Thebans failure to pay homage to him and espe cially for the resistance of his own family Having brought about  Pentheus death the god banishes the rest of the family from the city  Peace and harmony now return to Thebes which will henceforth  honor the god in the manner ordained by him   The murder thus appears as the outcome of a divine plan and at the  same time the result of a spontaneous outburst The divine plan falls  within the formalized framework of ritual sacrifice In this instance the     Dionysus 131   god himself is the sacrificer and prepares the future victim the sacrifi cial act ordained by him coincides with the act of revenge that will  appease his anger Under the pretext of arranging his costume and  coiffure Dionysus manages to touch Pentheus ritualistically on his  head waist and feet The murder itself is performed in accordance  with Dionysiac practice it includes the distinctive sparagmos or dis memberment which we have already encountered in other sacrificial  contexts In addition 1 all the bacchantes participate in the killing  This satisfies the requirements of unanimity which figures in so many  rituals And 2 no weapon is used the victim is torn apart by the  womens bare hands Such a performance is not peculiar to the Dionys iac cult We have already cited two examples of collective murders  without weapons one in a Dinka sacrifice and the other part of the  Swazi Incwala where a cow is substituted for the king there are many  similar examples The assertionmade by Rudolf Otto among others  that the Dionysiac rites were unique can easily be disproved There is no  aspect of the Dionysiac myth or ritual that does not find a distinct echo  in many primitive societies   The Euripidean version of the myth emphasizes the spontaneous  aspect of the ritualistic proceedings and thus affords us a fleeting  glimpseor at least a strong intimationof a real relationship between  the rite and a past event grounded in fact and partially reconstituted  by the dramatist The dismemberment of a living victim by unarmed  assailants each participating wholly in the act takes on a clear mean ing Even without Euripides detailed description we can imagine the  original scene It would not have been a case of premeditated assassina tion Everything suggests a crowd whose intentions were initially  pacific a disorganized mob that for unknown reasons of no real im portance to our argument came to a high pitch of mass hysteria The  crowd finally hurled itself on one individual even though he had no  particular qualifications for this role he served to polarize all the fears  anxieties and hostilities of the crowd His violent death provided the  necessarv outlet for the mass anguish and restored peace3   The ritual sparagmos reenacts with scrupulous exactitude the mob  violence that brought riot and disorder to an end In the ritual perfor mance the community tries to mimic the gestures that effected its  salvation It is also trying paradoxically enough to recapture through  ritual the element of complete spontaneity Here as elsewhere tragedy  occupies an ambiguous intermediary position between the ritual per formance and the spontaneous model that the ritual attempts to repro duce From the point of view of established religious doctrine   3 The best treatment of the crowds role in abolishing differences is Elias Canettis  Crowds and Power trans Carol Stewart New York 1966     132 Violence and the Sacred   Dionysus is wholly responsible for Pentheus murder After all the  god is master of events it is he who prepares from afar the details of  the first sacrifice his own sacrificial enterprise that is the most awe some and effective of all sacrifices the one that truly mends the shat tered community But from the point of view of a religioninthe making the murder of Pentheus appears as a spontaneous resolution  that could be neither planned nor anticipated   The collective violence is openly displayed but the essential process  the arbitrary choice of the victim and the sacrificial substitution that  restores unityremains concealed The actual expulsion of the victim  recedes from sight and maintains its efficiency by appearing only in the  guise of institutionalized sacrifice From the viewpoint of the sacrificial  crisis the relationship between the doubles Dionysus and Pentheus is  reciprocal in a double sense There is no reason why it should be  Dionysus rather than Pentheus who sacrifices his companion Yet from  the viewpoint of established religion even if this reciprocity is at one  level acknowledged and the sacrificer and his victim are recognized as  doubles on another and more basic level this same reciprocitv is abol ished The direction must not be allowed to reverse itself it has been  fixed once and for all and the expulsion is always understood to have  already taken place   We cannot hope to understand the rite merely by attributing it to  psychic motivations either conscious or unconscious And in spite of  all appearances gratuitous sadism plays no part in the procedure The  rite is directed toward order and tranquillity not violence It strives to  achieve violence solely in order to eliminate it Nothing is more naive  or in the final analysis more futile than the speculations psychological  theorists derive from the brutality of a rite such as the sparagmos   The Bacchae offers ample evidence in support of my definition of  sacrifice Euripides tragedv and the whole cult of Dionysus seem to  provide strong support for the hypothesis that traces myth and ritual  to a generative act of unanimity   e4 THE IMPARTIAL READER approaching the play  free of the influence of Nietzsche or Rudolf Otto is always struck by  the sheer perfidy of Dionysuss role Throughout the play the god  wanders from place to place engendering violence and crime with the  artfulness of a satanic seducer Only the quixotic masochism of our  own age the result of a long immunity to the violence that threatens  primitive societies allows us to see anything attractive in the Dionysus  of The Bacchae It seems clear that Euripides shares none of our illu sions which would be comic if they were less disquieting     Dionysus 133   The god has no proper being outside the realm of violence All his  attributes are linked to violence if he is associated with the gift of  prophetic inspiration like the Delphic Apollo who figures in the  Oedipus myth it is because prophetic inspiration is part of the sacrifi cial crisis And if he later appears as the god of wine that is probably a  more sedate version of his original designation as the god of homicidal  fury Certainly there is nothing in the ancient Dionysiac tradition that  alludes directly to viniculture or the production of wine4 In The  Bacchae the epiphany of the god arises from the catastrophic conse quences of the sacrificial crisis which is symbolized by the destruction  of Pentheuss palace   Chorus Divine tremor shake the floor of the earth  Dionysus See The palace of Pentheus trembles It falls Dionysus is   standing there Bow down before him  Chorus We bow down before him Ah see the marble friezes fall   Bromios will shout with triumph within  Dionysus Let divine lightning be the torch Now set afire the ruins of   Pentheuss palace  Chorus Ah ah Look look Around the sacred tomb of Semele the   eversmouldering fire leaps in flame Prostrate yourselves before your  god O Maenads The palace falls He is coming the son of Zeus   It may seem surprising even scandalous that the incarnation of the  most terrible forms of violence should be an object of veneration as  well as of fear In this case however it is not the worshipers who are  naive but the bewildered observers   If we examine more closely the specific types of violence associated  with the god we find that an overall pattern appears This pattern  seems to confirm our interpretation of Pentheuss murder as a Di onysiac sacrifice Under the name of Brontiosthe Noisemaker the  EarthshakerDionysus presides over disasters that have nothing to do  with the thunderstorms and earthquakes beloved of nineteenth century scholars but that in fact always involve a mob impelled by  sheer panic to the performance of extraordinary acts Tiresias defines  Dionysus as the god of mob hysteria of sudden onslaughts of collec tive fear Soldiers in full battle array and poised for combat are  transfixed by panic before a lance has touched them This hysteria is  Dionysuss work   Such statements added to the ones we have already collected and to   4Cf Henri Jeanmaire Dionysos Histoire du culte de Bacchus Paris 1970  p 23     134 Violence and the Sacred   the body of evidence drawn from other rices leads to the inescapable  conclusion that Dionysus is the god of decisive mob action Once  stated it should be easy to see why such a god is called for and why he  is revered He claims legitimacy not from his ability to disturb the  peace but from his ability to restore the peace he has himself disturbed  thereby justifying a posteriori having disturbed it in the first place  Divine intervention is transformed into legitimate anger against a  blasphemous hubris which until the crucial display of unanimity  seemed to implicate the god himself   Textual criticism confirms the theories that portray the Dionysiac  cult as a consequence of major political and social upheavals In spite of  its limitations a work like Erwin Rohdes Psyche manifests a profound  intuitive grasp of reality In the absence of new documentary evidence  the traditional historical method can make little progress Only a com parative analysis of texts and of significant religious phenomena a  method utilized by Rohde but on too small a scale can substantially  increase our knowledge5   Along with any known historical context we can infer behind a  myth like that of The Bacchae a sudden outbreak of violence so ex treme as to threaten the very existence of the community This threat  will eventually be withdrawn as rapidly as it appeared thanks to a  type of mob violence that reconciles all members of the community  because it involves the participation of all The metamorphosis from  peaceable citizens into raging beasts is too terrifying and too transitory  for the community to accept it as issuing from within itself As soon as  calm has been miraculously restored the past tumult will be looked  upon as a supreme example of divine intervention Angered at discov ering himself ignored or misrepresented a god has made known his  wishes in a thoroughly godlike manner Having accepted a final victim  a victim of his own choice in which he may also be incarnated he  silently withdraws from the scene He will be as benevolent from afar  as he was terrible in propinquity   Religion then is far from useless It humanizes violence it pro tects man from his own violence by taking it out of his hands trans forming it into a transcendent and everpresent danger to be kept in  check by the appropriate rites appropriately observed and by a modest  and prudent demeanor Religious misinterpretation is a truly construc  5 Erwin Rohde Psyche The

of the sacrificial crisis and unanimous generative violence     Dionysus 135   tive force for it purges man of the suspicions that would poison his  existence if he were to remain conscious of the crisis as it actually took  place   To think religiously is to envision the citys destiny in terms of that  violence whose mastery over man increases as man believes he has  gained mastery over it To think religiously in the primitive sense is  to see violence as something superhuman to be kept always at a dis tance and ultimately renounced When the fearful adoration of this  power begins to diminish and all distinctions begin to disappear the  ritual sacrifices lose their force their potency is no longer recognized  by the entire community Each member tries to correct the situation  individually and none succeeds The withering away of the transcen dental influence means that there is no longer the slightest difference  between a desire to save the city and unbridled ambition between  genuine piety and the desire to claim divine status for oneself Every one looks on a rival enterprise as evidence of blasphemous designs It  was at such a moment that all the distinctions between Dionysus and  Pentheus were effaced Men set to quarreling about the gods and  their skepticism leads to a new sacrificial crisis that will appear  retrospectively in the light of a new manifestation of unanimous  violenceas a new act of divine intervention and divine revenge   Men would not be able to shake loose the violence between them to  make of it a separate entity both sovereign and redemptory without  the surrogate victim Also violence itself offers a sort of respite the  fresh beginning of a cycle of ritual after a cycle of violence Violence  wrill come to an end only after it has had the last word and that word  has been accepted as divine The meaning of this word must remain  hidden the mechanism of unanimity remain concealed For religion  protects man as long as its ultimate foundations are not revealed To  drive the monster from its secret lair is to risk loosing it on mankind  To remove mens ignorance is only to risk exposing them to an even  greater peril The only barrier against human violence is raised on  misconception In fact the sacrificial crisis is simply another form of  that knowledge which grows greater as the reciprocal violence grows  more intense but which never leads to the whole truth It is the knowl edge of violence along with the violence itself that the act of expul sion succeeds in shunting outside the realm of consciousness From the  very fact that it belies the overt mythological messages tragic drama  opens a vast abyss before the poet but he always draws back at the last  moment He is exposed to a form of hubris more dangerous than any  contracted by his characters it has to do with a truth that is felt to be  infinitely destructive even if it is not fully understoodand its de    136 Violence and the Sacred   structiveness is as obvious to ancient religious thought as it is to mod ern philosophers Thus we are dealing with an interdiction that still  applies to ourselves and that modern thought has not yet invalidated  The fact that this secret has been subjected to exceptional pressure in  the play must prompt the following lines   May our thoughts never aspire to anything higher than the laws What  does it cost man to acknowledge the full sovereignty of the gods That  which has always been held as true owes its strength to Nature    G   FOR DIONYSUS AS FOR OEDIPUS the mythic  elaboration the transfiguring medium of the story leads to the reor ganization of certain elements that properly pertain to collective phe nomena anterior to the myth elements that would be wholly  unsuitable even unintelligible if they were evenly distributed among  the characters if that is the reciprocal nature of the violence were  duly acknowledged In both cases reciprocity yields to difference and  this difference severs the god or mythic hero from the community  while drawing to him all the communitys violent impulses Hence forth the role of violence in the crisisin addition to its function in  purely ritualistic or sacrificial termswill be recalled solely as that of a  passive agent of contagion the plague in the Oedipus myth or the  fraternal nondifferentiation or the Dionysiac bacchanal   All the elements that enter into the composition of the myth are  borrowed from the reality of the crisis nothing has been added noth ing taken away no conscious alterations have been made Mythological  elaboration is an unconscious process based on the surrogate victim and  nourished by the presence of violence This presence is not re pressed not cast off on the unconscious rather it is detached from  man and made divine   Tragic inspiration dissolves fictive differences in reciprocal violence  it demystifies the double illusion of a violent divinity and an innocent  community The mixed choruses at the festivals of Dionysus and the  temporary permission granted women to drink wine are faint echoes  of a more awesome type of intoxication Tragic inspiration demystifies  the bacchanal consequently it destroys the delusion based on the col lective transference upon which a major portion of the rite depends  The rite is not oriented toward violence but toward peace The tragic  demystification discloses a bacchanal that is pure frenzy naked vio lence And the process of tragic demystification is itself violent for it  cannot but weaken the rites and contribute to their going wrong  Far from toiling in the cause of peace and universal understanding as a  world blind to the social role of human violence likes to believe anti    Dionysus 131   religious demystification is every bit as ambiguous as religion itself If  it takes up arms against a certain type of violence it may well bring  about another undoubtedly more destructive type Unlike the mod erns Euripides confronts this ambiguity head on and that is wrhy he  never advances in one direction without subsequendy retracing his  steps in another In his oscillations between audacity and timidity  he appears to be alternately defending and denouncing the bacchanal  At the beginning of the play the bacchanal is presented in a favorable  light by Cadmus and Tiresias who both make speeches in praise of  Dionysus Euripides seems anxious to defend the cult against those who  would associate Dionysiac nondifferentiation with promiscuity and  violence The bacchantes are presented as models of tranquillity and  decorum and the hostile aspersions cast on the cult are indignantly  rejected by the poet   The defense of the bacchantes however is immediately belied by  events As Marie DelcourtCurvers remarks in her introduction to the  play we wonder what meaning the poet intended to give to the antics  of Agaue and her companionsinnocent at first to the point of seem ing slightly ridiculous then disquieting and finally murderous so  that having doubted the very existence of a problem of The Bacchae  we are forced to acknowledge both the problem and our inability to  resolve it6   The rite may stem from violence and be steeped in violence but it  still aspires to peace In fact it is a means of promoting harmony  between the members of the community Euripides tried to save the  rite from the destruction visited on all religious concepts by sacrificial  crises and the tragic mode But this effort was doomed to failure the  poets tragic inspiration all too easily overcame his good intentions and  once the sacrificial and nonsacrificial have been mixedlike the two  drops of Gorgons bloodthere is no separating them   The problem of The Bacchae would never have arisen if Euripides  had fully acceded to the violent origin of the rite the playing out of  violence and had acknowledged the generative act of unanimity pre served by the rite lost in the onslaught of reciprocal violence and  recovered through the mechanism of the surrogate victim He could  then have demonstrated that the good and bad aspects of the bacchanal  correspond to the two faces of the generative act The same creatures  who are at each others throats during the course of a sacrificial crisis  are fully capable of coexisting before and after the crisis in the rela tive harmony of a ritualistic order   Indeed there would have been no problem if Euripides had been   Euripide ed and trans Marie DelcourtCurvers Paris 1962     138 Violence and the Sacred   able to adopt the perspective of primitive religion openlv espousing  the sacred while stripping man of his violence and reattributing it to  divine influences Again there would have been no problem of The  Bacchae if the play had been able to bring his perplexities to rest with  one of the intermediate positions between the two extremes of the  religious solution which transfers the whole burden of violence to the  divinity and the unadorned truth which passes the violence back to  man   In this intermediate system which is the system of modern man the  opposition between violent disjunction and peaceful harmonya  difference that should unfold in the course of time as a diachronic  processis transmuted into a synchronic difference We enter a uni verse populated by good and evil influencesthe only universe in  which we feel truly at home   Such a universe is adumbrated in The Bacchae All the elements of  its establishment are there the concept of an impious revolt against  the gods the partitioning of the gods retinue into authentic  Lydian and inauthentic Theban maenads However at the core  of the tragic action all distinctions between a good and a bad  Dionysiac possessionbetween enthusiasm rewarded as a prize to the  faithful and enthusiasm meted out as a punishment to the wickedare  effaced The Manichaean division between good and evil is no sooner  proposed than it vanishes from sight   This division it should be noted is reflected in the continuing hunt  for a scapegoat on the cultural and ideological level a hunt that has  gone on long after Pentheus met his fate on the slopes of Mount  Cithaeron   To resolve the problem of The Bacchae we would need to establish  a system of differentiation that did not dissolve under scrutiny and that  permitted us to affirm the plays literary psychological and moral  coherence Such a system would be based once again on recourse to  arbitrary violence   The foundations of The Bacchae have not been uncovered but they  have been soundly shaken It is not Euripides psychological ap proach that is ultimately responsible for the incoherence of the trag edy its oscillation between audacity and timidity Rather it is the  snaking of degrees which Euripides cannot and will not explicitly  acknowledge but which blunts all distinctions and multiplies all mean ings allowing none of them to remain unshaken   The tragedy never succeeds in finding its equilibrium but then  there is no place for equilibrium in the drama It is from this that the  plays fertile incoherence stemsan incoherence very different from  the sterile coherence of lesser works of art intellectuaIly and es    Dionysus 139   hetically beyond reproach There is no point in trying to resolve the  problem of The Bacchae any more than there is in trying to resolve  he opposition between the symmetry of the tragic action and the  iissymetry of the mythological message in Oedipus the King Ulti mately these two problems are one Instead of trying to force tragedy  to conform to our trivial and insignificant criterion of coherence we  should concentrate on the logical flaws of tragedy and try to penetrate  the inviolate interiors of the myths to see how they are put together  We must generalize the problem of The Bacckae so that it applies to all  culturesreligious and nonreligious primitive and nonprimitive Our  problem then will relate to cultures violent origins previously hidden  but now discernible in the rapid disintegration of the last sacrificial  practices of the modern world       THE PREPONDERANCE OF WOMEN in the Di onvsiac cult remains a subject of conjecture We may well wonder  without retracting any of our previous suppositions whether the  charges brought against the womentheir responsibility for Pen theuss murder the homicidal frenzy that characterizes their behavior  throughout the original bacchanal that is throughout the sacrificial  crisisare not every bit as false as the idyllic portrait of the bac chanal at the beginning of the play as a rustic interlude amid the  flowers and forests of Cithaeron   The two protagonists are male but behind them there are only  women and old men Homicidal fury is very real during the crisis but  it pertains to the entire community the violence directed against the  surrogate victim cannot be limited strictly to the women We may  therefore wonder whether the preponderance of women does not con stitute a secondary mythological displacement an effort to exonerate  from the accusation of violence not mankind as a wrhole but adult  males who have the greatest need to forget their role in the crisis  because in fact they must have been largely responsible for it They  alone risk plunging the community into the chaos of reciprocal vio lence   We can therefore postulate a mythological substitution of women  for men in regard to violence That is not to say that the womens link  to Mount Cithaeron was pure invention Myths invent nothing but the  true meaning of this mass migration of women accompanied by their  children and perhaps by old men may well have been as badly dis torted by the tragic handling as by pastoral idealizing We are told that  the exodus from the city was prompted by divine inspiration and  Dionysiac enthusiasm Thus exodus becomes a characteristic trait of  the crisis but it is neither a triumphal procession nor an irresistible     140 Violence and the Sacred   charge Rather it is likely to have been a frantic flight of those mem bers of the community whose age or sex prevented them from bearing  arms The weaker leave the field to the stronger who spread terror  throughout the city   Anthropological evidence seems to support this hypothesis Napo leon Chagnon describes a festival organized by a number of closely  related Yanomamo communities The program of entertainment in cluded a series of chest pounding duels ostensibly of friendly intent  and traditional to the occasion At the moment when the imminent  defeat of one team threatened to turn the contest into a bloody battle  the women and children began to cry knowing that the situation was  getting serious and they grouped into the farthest corners of their  houses near the exits Shortlv after while the warriors of both fac tions were preparing for combat and gathering their poisoned arrows  the women and children    began fleeing from the village screaming  and wailing7   The role played by women in the religious and cultural structure of  a societyor rather the minor importance of that roleis graphically  illustrated by the social framework prevailing in certain South Amer ican villagesin those of Bororo for example8 The village is laid out  in the form of an almost perfect circle divided up according to social  categories In the center is the mens house entrance is forbidden to  women Cultural and religious activities consist for the main part of a  complex system of comings and goings confined entirely to the men  with the central house serving as a sort of general meeting place The  women inhabit the houses on the periphery of the circle and unlike  the men they never move to another house This immobility of the  women was one of the factors that led early researchers to affirm the  existence of a matriarchy In fact far from attesting to womens  importance this very stability suggests that women are only passive  spectators at a masculine tragicomedy The elegant dance ritual prac ticed by the men in time of order and tranquillity amounts to a precau tionary measure designed to prevent the violent encounters that occur  in times of turbulence The physical structure of the Bororo village  seems to reflect the centrifugal inclinations of its weakest inhabitants  the women by making the center an exclusively masculine preserve  This inclination is universal it was observed by Chagnon in its most  literal form during the Yanomamo festival and it can be surmised  behind the less convincing aspects of the Dionysus myth   The motionless groups of women gathered together in the periph  7 Napoleon Chagnon Yanomamo the Fierce People New York 1968 p 116  8Cf Claude LeviStrauss Tristes Tropiques trans John Weightman and   Doreen Weightman New York 1975 chap 22     Dionysus 141   eral houses bring powerfully to mind the people who cluster on side walks or at street corners whenever something is going onusually  some dispute or brawl The desire not to miss any part of the show  balanced by the desire to remain at a safe distance from the action  causes the spectators to form themselves into a circle around the object  of interest Psychoanalysts will note of course that the mens house  has been inserted like a phallus in the feminine circle but this observa tion scarcely helps to explain the situation Beyond the sexual sym bolism is the violence that gives shape to the events and that literally  inscribes itselffirst as a cultural order then as sexuality hidden be hind that order and finally and openly as violence which underlies all  possible meanings and remains indecipherable as long as any other  meaning overlays it   Returning to the subject of Dionysus we repeat that the presence of  the women outside the city might well represent a real circumstance of  the original crisis transfigured by a mythological operation analogous  to but distinct from the one we have already analyzed A transfer of  violence can be assumed parallel to the one that engenders the god but  of less consequence We are dealing here with a mythological elabora tion that probably took place early at an epoch when the divinity had  not yet absorbed the most violent and repulsive aspects of the sacrifi cial crisis The characteristic features of the crisis are not yet suffi ciently blurred and indistinct for men to be willing to acknowledge  them as their own   The tendency to attribute to women what is probably a masculine  trait of violence can be related to a major thematic motif of The  Bacchae the loss of sexual differentiation As we have remarked one  of the effects of the sacrificial crisis is a certain feminization of the  men accompanied by a masculinization of the women For the idea  that men behave like women and women like men is substituted the  idea that the sinister Dionysiac practices are almost exclusively wom ens work The abolishment of sexual differencesfor that matter of  all differencesis a reciprocal phenomenon and the mythological re distribution has been carried out as always at the expense of reciproc ity The symmetrical elements regroup under a nonsymmetrical form  a form reassuring to male dignity and authority for it grants what  amounts to a virtual monopoly on Dionysiac delirium to the women   Here again tragedy restores lost reciprocity but only partially it  does not dare challenge the dominant feminine role in the origins of  the Dionysiac rites And if the lost sexual difference makes it easier to  shunt the responsibility for violence onto the women it still cannot  explain away the necessity for violence Like the animal and the infant  but to a lesser degree the woman qualifies for sacrificial status by     142 Violence and the Sacred   reason of her weakness and relatively marginal social status That is  why she can be viewed as a quasisacred figure both desired and  disdained alternately elevated and abused A reading of Greek  mythology and tragedy especially the plays of Euripides with par ticular attention to the possible inversion of the sexes would undoubt edly yield some striking results     sy Chapter Six   From Mimetic Desire to  the Monstrous Double   CfSrf IN THE BACCHAE the intervention of the god coin   cides with the loss of generative unanimity and the in  evitable slide into reciprocal violence When the transcendental element  descends to the human sphere it is reduced to immanence transformed  back into mimetic fascination Reciprocal violence now demolishes  everything that unanimous violence had erected And as the institutions  and interdictions based on generative unanimity perish violence roams  at will unchallenged and unchecked The god who has appeared malle able and complaisant a willing servant of mankind always manages to  slip away at the last moment leaving destruction in his wake Then the  men who sought to bend him to their uses turn on one another with  murderous intent   In Oedipus the King the tragic conflict still centers at least in ap pearance on specific concerns the throne of Thebes and the queen  who is both mother and wife In The Bacchae by contrast Dionysus  and Pentheus have nothing concrete to fight over Their rivalry cen ters on divinity itself but behind that divinity there lies only violence  To compete for divinity is to compete for a chimera because the  reality of the divine rests in its transcendental absence It is not the  hysterical rivalry of men that will engender godsonly unanimous  violence can accomplish that Insofar as divinity is real it cannot serve  as a prize to be won in a contest Insofar as it is regarded as a prize it is  merely a phantom that will invariably escape mans grasp and turn to  violence   Every tragic protagonist is fated to pursue this phantom And as  soon as one individual attempts to incarnate divine violence rivalries  spring up The violence remains reciprocal there is no profit to any one when only blows are traded The chorus perceives the train of  events and scrupulously avoids involving itself in the tragic action   We must take care not to view the tragic conflict in terms of its  immediate goals even when they are objects of such consequence as a   143     144 Violence and the Sacred   throne or a queen The Baccbae teaches us that we must invert the  usual order of things in order to appreciate the import of tragic riv alry In the traditional view the object comes first followed by human  desires that converge independently on this object Last of all comes  violence a fortuitous consequence of the convergence As the sacrifi cial conflict increases in intensity so too does the violence It is no  longer the intrinsic value of the object that inspires the struggle  rather it is the violence itself that bestows value on the objects which  are only pretexts for a conflict From this point on it is violence that  calls the tune Violence is the divine force that everyone tries to use  for his own purposes and that ends by using everyone for its ownthe  Dionysus of The Baccbae   In the light of this knowledge even the preliminary stages of the  sacrificial crisis can be seen to reveal the dominant influence of vio lence Certain scenes of Oedipus the King while less explicit in their  violence than those of The Baccbae gain intensity and significance  when viewed with the lessons of The Baccbae in mind When Oedipus  and Laius meet at the crossroads the fatherson and kingsubject rela tionship is not initially in question Their encounter begins with a  strangers menacing gesture the older man barring the road to the  younger one Oedipuss reaction is to strike out at the stranger then at  his throne then at his wife that is to strike at the objects belonging to  the initiator of violence Only in the end is the aggressor identified as  father and king In other words it is violence that bestows value on the  violent mans possessions Laius is not violent because he is a father  rather it is because of his violence that he passes as a father and a king  Is that not what Heraclitus had in mind when he proclaimed that  violence is the father and king of all   Nothing perhaps could be more banal than the role of violence in  awakening desire Our modern terms for this phenomenon are sadism  or masochism depending on its manifestations we regard it as a  pathological deviation from the norm We believe that the normal  form of desire is nonviolent and that this nonviolent form is character istic of the generality of mankind   But if the sacrificial crisis is a universal phenomenon this hopeful  belief is clearly without foundation At the very height of the crisis  violence becomes simultaneously the instrument object and allinclu sive subject of desire This is why social coexistence would be impos sible if no surrogate victim existed if violence persisted beyond a  certain threshold and failed to be transmuted into culture It is only at  this point that the vicious circle of reciprocal violence wholly destruc tive in nature is replaced by the vicious circle of ritual violence  creative and protective in nature     From Mimetic Desire to the Monstrous Double 145   At the height of the sacrificial crisis mans desires are focused on one  thing only violence And in one way or another violence is always  mingled with desire The statement that violence is kinstinctive adds  nothing to our understanding of this strange and startling relationship  on the contrary it only clouds the issue Today we know that animals  possess individual braking mechanisms to insure that combats between  them seldom result in the actual death of the vanquished Because such  mechanisms tend to assure the perpetuation of the species it would  perhaps be not inappropriate to term them instinctive To use the same  term in connection with mans lack of such a braking device however  would be absurd   The notion of an instinct or if one prefers an impulse that propels  men toward violence or deathFreuds famous death wishis no  more than a last surrender to mythological thinking a final manifesta tion of that ancient belief that human violence can be attributed to  some outside influenceto gods to Fate to some force men can hardly  be expected to control Once again it is a mode of thought that refuses  to confront human conflicts squarely It is an act of evasion an attempt  to pass the buck1 and find an alternate sacrificial solution in a situa tion which makes such a solution increasingly difficult   In the midst of the sacrificial crisis there is no point in attaching  desire to any one object no matter how attractive for desire is wholly  directed toward violence itself This does not mean however that we  must endow man with an instinctive drive toward death or violence  There is still another approach open to us   In all the varieties of desire examined bv us we have encountered  not only a subject and an object but a third presence as well the rival  It is the rival who should be accorded the dominant role We must take  care however to identify him correctly not to say with Freud that  he is the father or in the case of the tragedies that he is the brother  Our first task is to define the rivals position within the system to  which he belongs in relation to both subject and object The rival  desires the same object as the subject and to assert the primacy of the  rival can lead to only one conclusion Rivalry does not arise because of  the fortuitous convergence of two desires on a single object rather  the subject desires the object because the rival desires it In desiring an  object the rival alerts the subject to the desirability of the object The  rival then serves as a model for the subject not only in regard to such  secondary matters as style and opinions but also and more essentially  in regard to desires   When modern theorists envisage man as a being who knows what he  wants or who at least possesses an unconscious that knows for him  they may simply have failed to perceive the domain in which human     146 Violence and the Sacred   uncertainty is most extreme Once his basic needs are satisfied indeed  sometimes even before man is subject to intense desires though he  may not know precisely for what The reason is that he desires being  something he himself lacks and which some other person seems to  possess The subject thus looks to that other person to inform him of  what he should desire in order to acquire that being If the model who  is apparently already endowed with superior being desires some ob ject that object must surely be capable of conferring an even greater  plenitude of being It is not through words therefore but by the  example of his own desire that the model conveys to the subject the  supreme desirability of the object   We find ourselves reverting to an ancient notionmimesisone  whose conflictual implications have always been misunderstood We  must understand that desire itself is essentially mimetic directed  toward an object desired by the model   The mimetic quality of childhood desire is universally recognized  Adult desire is virtually identical except that most strikingly in our  own culture the adult is generally ashamed to imitate others for fear  of revealing his lack of being The adult likes to assert his indepen dence and to offer himself as a model to others he invariably falls back  on the formula imitate me in order to conceal his own lack of  originality   Two desires converging on the same object are bound to clash  Thus mimesis coupled with desire leads automatically to conflict  However men always seem half blind to this conjunction unable to  perceive it as a cause of rivalry In human relationships words like  sameness and similarity evoke an image of harmony If we have the  same tastes and like the same things surely we are bound to get along  But what will happen when we share the same desires Only the major  dramatists and novelists have partly understood and explored this form  of rivalry1 Even Freud treated it in an indirect and distorted fashion  as we shall see in the next chapter   By a strange but explicable consequence of their relationship neither  the model nor the disciple is disposed to acknowledge the inevitable  rivalry The model even when he has openly encouraged imitation is  surprised to find himself engaged in competition He concludes that  the disciple has betrayed his confidence by following in his footsteps  As for the disciple he feels both rejected and humiliated judged un worthy by his model of participating in the superior existence the  model himself enjoys   The reason for these misunderstandings is not hard to grasp The  1 For a discussion of these works see my Deceit Desire and the Novel Balti  more 1965     From Mimetic Desire to the Monstrous Double 147   model considers himself too far above the disciple the disciple consid ers himself too far below the model for either of them even fleetingly  to entertain the notion that their desires are identicalin short that  they might indeed be rivals To make the reciprocity complete we  need only add that the disciple can also serve as a model even to his  own model As for the model no matter how selfsufficient he may  appear he invariably assumes the role of disciple either in this context  or another From all indications only the role of disciple is truly  essentialit is this role that must be invoked to define the basic human  condition   The mimetic aspects of desire must correspond to a primary impulse  of most living creatures exacerbated in man to the point where only  cultural constraints can channel it in constructive directions Man can not respond to that universal human injunction Imitate me without  almost immediately encountering an inexplicable counterorder Dont  imitate me which really means Do not appropriate my object  This second command fills man with despair and turns him into the  slave of an involuntary tyrant Man and his desires thus perpetually  transmit contradictory signals to one another Neither model nor dis ciple really understands why one constantly thwarts the other because  neither perceives that his desire has become the reflection of the oth ers Far from being restricted to a limited number of pathological  cases as American theoreticians suggest the double binda contradic tory double imperative or rather a whole network of contradictory  imperativesis an extremely common phenomenon In fact it is so  common that it might be said to form the basis of all human relation ships2   Bateson is undoubtedly correct in believing that the effects of the  double bind on the child are particularly devastating All the grownup  voices around him beginning with those of the father and mother  voices which in our society at least speak for the culture with the  force of established authority exclaim in a variety of accents Imitate  us Imitate me UI bear the secret of life of true being The more  attentive the child is to these seductive words and the more earnestly  he responds to the suggestions emanating from all sides the more  devastating will be the eventual conflicts The child possesses no per spective that will allow him to see things as they are He has no basis  for reasoned judgements no means of foreseeing the metamorphosis of  his model into a rival This models opposition reverberates in his mind  like a terrible condemnation he can only regard it as an act of excom munication The future orientation of his desiresthat is the choice of   2See Gregory Bateson et al Toward a Theory of Schizophrenia in Steps to  an Ecology of the Mind New York 1972 pp 20127     148 Violence and the Sacred   his future modelswill be significantly affected by the dichotomies of  his childhood In fact these models will determine the shape of his  personality   If desire is allowed to follow its own bent its mimetic nature will  almost always lead it into a double bind The unchanneled mimetic  impulse hurls itself blindly against the obstacle of a conflicting desire  It invites its own rebuffs and these rebuffs will in turn strengthen the  mimetic inclination We have then a selfperpetuating process con stantly increasing in simplicity and fervor Whenever the disciple  borrows from his model what he believes to be the true object he  tries to possess that truth by desiring precisely what this model desires  Whenever he sees himself closest to the supreme goal he comes into  violent conflict with a rival By a mental shortcut that is both emi nently logical and selfdefeating he convinces himself that the violence  itself is the most distinctive attribute of this supreme goal Ever after ward violence and desire will be linked in his mind and the presence  of violence will invariably awaken desire Perhaps this is why the  possessions that serve to symbolize being in Oedipus the Kingthe  throne and the queenare behind the strangers angry gesture at  the crossroads Violence is the father and king of everything Jocasta  affirms this truth in declaring that Oedipus belongs to whomever  speaks to him of phobouof unhappiness terror disasters nefarious  violence of any sort The oracular pronouncements of Laius Creon  and Tiresias and the ill tidings of the messengers emanate from that  logos phobou to which all the characters in the myth belong The  logos phobou is ultimately the wordless language by which mimetic  desire and violence communicate with one another   Violent opposition then is the signifier of ultimate desire of divine  selfsufficiency of that beautiful totality whose beauty depends on  its being inaccessible and impenetrable The victim of this violence  both adores and detests it He strives to master it by means of a  mimetic counterviolence and measures his own stature in proportion to  his failure If by chance however he actually succeeds in asserting his  mastery over the model the latters prestige vanishes He must then  turn to an even greater violence and seek out an obstacle that promises  to be truly insurmountable   Mimetic desire is simply a term more comprehensive than violence  for religious pollution As the catalyst for the sacrificial crisis it would  eventually destroy the entire community if the surrogate victim were  not at hand to halt the process and the ritualized mimesis were not at  hand to keep the conflictual mimesis from beginning afresh As I have  already indicated a little later on I will formally examine the evi dence there are all sorts of rules and regulations that prevent desire     From Mimetic Desire to the Monstrous Double 149   from floating free and attaching itself to the first model that comes  along By channeling its energies into ritual forms and activities sanc tioned by ritual the cultural order prevents multiple desires from con verging on the same object Notably it protects children from the  disastrous effects of the double bind    Q t f  AS THE READER MAY RECALL I have tried to  demonstrate that the characters in tragedy are ultimately indistinguish able The words used to describe any one of them in psychological  sociological moral or even religious termsfor example hot tempered tyrannical hubristicare all equally applicable and  equally inadequate If the commentators have failed to remark that  these traits are the common property of all the characters in the play  it is because they are not all affected by them at the same time Anger  for example is always transitory It comes in fits emerging from a  background of tranquillitywhich is why it is always referred to as  sudden and unexpected Tyranny too is essentially unstable A new comer can ascend unexpectedly to the very summit of power only to  plummet while one of his opponents assumes his lost position In short  there is always a tyrant and always an oppressed but the roles alter nate There is always one character who is angry but while one of the  enemy brothers rants and rages the other may temporarily regain his  composure   In tragedy everything alternates But we must also reckon with the  irresistible tendency of the human spirit to suspend this oscillation to  fix attention on one extreme or the other This tendency is strictly  speaking mythological in nature It is responsible for the pseudo determination of the protagonists which in turn transforms revolving  oppositions into stable differences   The concept of alternation appears in tragedy but it figures there  deprived of its reciprocity Paradoxically it becomes a pseudospecifi cation it is presented as the characteristic attitude of a single individual  in the play Oedipus for instance proclaims himself the child of For tune and of Chance We moderns would be inclined to use the word  destiny which lends an air of solemnity and individuality17 to the  situation and avoids any hint of reciprocity   The hold of Fortune tukbe on Oedipus is manifested in a series of  highs and lows Fortune was my mother and the years that  tracked my life saw me in turn both great and small In the final lines  of the play the chorus defines the heros existence in terms of his  peri peteiai his reversals of fortune that is in terms once again of  alternation It matters little whether these lines were or were not  written by Sophocles     150 Violence and the Sacred   The definition is correct but it is no more correct for Oedipus than  for any other tragic hero That is apparent if we turn our attention  from a single play to the whole corpus of tragedy If the tragic heroes  are all compared their distinctive traits vanish for they all successively  assume the same roles Oedipus is an oppressor in Oedipus the King but  the oppressed in Oedipus at Colonus Creon is oppressed in Oedipus  the King but becomes the oppressor in Antigone Nobody in short  incarnates the true oppressor or the true oppressed and the modern  ideological interpretations seriously misconstrue the tragic spirit They  relegate the plays to the company of romantic melodrama or American  Westerns A static Manichaean confrontation of good guys and bad  guys an unyielding rancor that holds fast to its victims has replaced  the revolving oppositions of real tragedy and completely overshad owed the concept of the tragic peripeteia   Tragedy is interested in reversal as such it cares little for the do mains these reversals happen to affect Oedipuss alternating states of  anger and serenity for example contribute no less to his portrait as a  child of Fortune than do his alternating periods of exile and kingship  The different rhythm of these alternations and the disparity between  the realms to which they belong are such that we would scarcely think  of connecting the two indeed as far as I know traditional criticism has  never attempted to do so Yet once our attention has been drawn to the  subject we may suspect that every motif in tragedy is governed by an  alternating movement and our suspicion is confirmed by close exami nation   It is clear that alternation constitutes a relationship In fact alterna tion is a fundamental fact of the tragic relationshipwhich is why it  can scarcely be considered characteristic of any single individual At  first glance the alternation of tragedy may well seem dependent on the  object under dispute by the enemy brothers The object itself seems of  such importance that its loss of possession entails a radical reversal of  status a passage from being to nothingness or from nothingness to  being Such is the case for Eteocles and Polyneices who decide to take  turns wielding the power they are incapable of dividing between them  When Eteocles is king Polyneices is one of his subjects and vice  versa   However this alternation of objects has little direct connection with  tragic action The rhythm of the action is faster and more abrupt it is  reflected in the tragic dialogue or stichomythia that is in the exchange  of insults and accusations that corresponds to the exchange of blows  between warriors locked in single combat As we have noticed the  description of the duel between Eteocles and Polyneices in The     From Mimetic Desire to the Monstrous Double 151   Phoenician Women takes the place of a tragic dialogue and plays an  identical role   Whether the violence is physical or verbal an interval of time passes  between each blow And each blow is delivered in the hope that it will  bring the duel or dialogue to an end constitute the coup de grace or  final word The recipient of the blow is thrown momentarily off bal ance and needs time to pull himself together to prepare a suitable  reply During this interval his adversary may well believe that the  decisive blow has indeed been struck Victoryor rather the act of  violence that permits no responsethus oscillates between the com batants without either managing to lay final claim to it Only an act of  collective expulsion can bring this oscillation to a halt and cast violence  outside the community   Desire as we have seen is attracted to violence triumphant and  strives desperately to incarnate this irresistible force Desire clings to  violence and stalks it like a shadow because violence is the signifier of  the cherished being the signifier of divinity   If unanimous violence alone that is violence that spends itself can  properly be regarded as generative all the implications it makes mani fest and all the differences it succeeds in establishing are intimately  associated with the backandforth antagonism that precedes with the  oscillation of victory from one combatant to another throughout the  sacrificial crisis The fits of vertigo that attend the process stem from  this terrible oscillation and they ultimately engulf all perceived reality  Everything oscillates with a violence that seems to favor first one then  another individual or faction Whatever an initial act of violence seems  to settle is invariably subverted by a second act which reorders every thing anew As long as violence remains present among men and as  long as men pursue it as an absolute as a kind of divinity it will  continue its devastating oscillations   Euripides Bacckae offers the clue The idea of a contest in which  divinity is the prize passing from one contestant to the other with  uniformly disastrous results is essential to an understanding of all  tragic motifs for the structuring of these motifs is really patterned on  the action The reader may protest that we are dealing with an abstrac tion that the idea of a divine stake or prize identical to violence is  foreign to The Bacchae This idea may indeed be only suggested here  but no one can deny that it is explicit elsewhere and that it is quintes sentiallv Greek Certainly it is quite explicit in Homerthat is in a  literary text predating the tragedies   There arc several terms in Homer that dramatically illuminate the  relationship of violence desire and divinity The most useful perhaps     152 Violence and the Sacred   in the context of our discussion is the substantive kudos Kudos is best  defined in terms of semidivine prestige of mystical election attained by  military victory It was the reward sought by both Greek and Trojan  particularly in single combat   In his Dictionary of IndoEuropean Institutions Benveniste translates  kudos as talisman of supremacy It is the fascination of superior  violence Violence strikes men as at once seductive and terrifying  never as a simple means to an end but as an epiphany Violence tends  to generate unanimity either in its favor or against it And violence  promotes imbalance tipping the scales of Destiny in one direction or  another   At the least success violence begins to snowball becoming finally an  irresistible avalanche Those who possess kudos see their strength mul tiplied a hundredfold those deprived of it discover that they are hope lessly handicapped Kudos passes to the man who strikes the hardest  the victor of the moment It belongs to the man who manages to  convince others and who believes himself that his violence is com pletely irresistible The opposition must then exert itself to break the  spell cast by this conviction and to wrest the kudos from the enemys  grasp   When the rivalry becomes so intense that it destroys or disperses all  its objects it turns upon itself kudos alone becomes the ultimate ob ject The word is sometimes translated glory but as Benveniste has  remarked such a translation ignores the magicoreligious aspects that  are fundamental to the term Although the modern world lacks a word  for this phenomenon the phenomenon itself is familiar The spiritual  effects of triumphant violence are readily apparent in sexual activity in  games of skill or chance in athletic matches and in contests and com petitions of all kinds For the Greeks the issue of violence carried to  its extreme was divinity itself The epithet kudros signifies an attitude  of triumphant majesty a demeanor characteristic of the gods Man can  enjoy this condition only fleetingly and always at the expense of other  men To be a god is to possess kudos forever to remain forever a  master unchallenged and unchallangeable That is beyond the reach of  mortal man   It is the gods who confer kudos on men and the gods who take it  away The intermingling of human and divine in human conflicts is so  obvious that even Benveniste acknowledges it here in other cases  where this mixture is present he tries to separate the human and the  divine even though their combination might offer a clue to the process  of sacralization   As long as the concept of kudos existsthat is as long as there exists  a prize eminently desirable and thoroughly abstract that men strive     From Mimetic Desire to the Monstrous Double 153   onstantlv to wrest from one anotherthere can be no transcendent  orce capable of restoring peace What we are witnessing in this strug le for kudos is the decomposition of the divine brought about by  iolent reciprocity When the tide of battle turns against them Hom rs warriors sometimes justify their retreat with remarks like Today  teus has chosen to bestow kudos on our enemies perhaps tomorrow he  vill give it to us This alternation of kudos is identical to the alterna ions of tragedy We may even wonder whether the division of the  rods into two camps in the Iliad is not a late development The original  version may have involved a single god the personification of kudos  ftho oscillated from one camp to another depending on the course of  battle   In some Euripidean tragedies the alternation between high and  low is sharply delineated It is linked to a form of violence that is no  longer physical but spiritual that inverts the relationship between  dominating and dominated In Andromache for instance Hermione  treats the heroine with complete disdain insisting on the vast gulf that  must separate Neoptolemus lawful wife and queen from his mistress a  captive slave at the mercy of her captors Presently however the  tragic peripeteia takes place Hermione meets her downfall and be comes in effect the slave of Andromache   What god would I invoke At what shrine offer prayers Must I  slavishly embrace the knees of a slave   Euripides is less interested in the changes of circumstance brought  about by the plot than in Hermiones overreaction to these changes  The nurse remarks   My child I did not hide my disapproval when you gave way to such  violent hatred for the Trojan woman nor do I now approve your giving  way to panic   Overreaction is characteristic of these tragic reversals of fortune  Yet the overreactions that actually serve to alter the power structure in  the play are drawn from other sources Although no decisive action  has taken place while Neoptolemus was away in Delphi a tragic debate  has taken place between Hermiones father Menelaus who is deter mined to kill Andromache and the aged Peleus who stands forth as  her champion Peleus gains the upper hand and emerges with kudos   The transferal of kudos is not simply a subjective matter though it  is not objective either It involves a relationship in which the roles of  dominating and dominated are constantly reversed Neither psycholog ical nor sociological interpretations can help us here There is no point     14 Violence and the Sacred   in invoking a masterslave dialectic because the situation affords no  stability of any sort no synthetic resolution   In the end the kudos means nothing It is the prize of a temporary  victory an advantage no sooner won than challenged It might be  compared to those sporting trophies that are passed from winner to  winner and that are really nothing but a title an abstraction To take  the metaphor too seriously however would only lead to another  mythical and ritualistic distortion Far from subordinating religion to  sport or play as does Huizinga in Homo Ludens we must subordi nate play to religion and in particular to the sacrificial crisis Play has a  religious origin to be sure insofar as it reproduces certain aspects of  the sacrificial crisis The arbitrary nature of the prize makes it clear  that the contest has no other objective than itself but this contest is  regulated in such a manner that in principle at least it can never  degenerate into a brutal fight to the finish   There is no term in any language that is not accompanied by mytho logical inflections In the case of kudos the reciprocity of the violence  is not relinquished but is muted so as to suggest some joust or tourney  Because we see that the prize is worthless we tend to assume that the  contest itself no matter how perilous is only a pastime an event of  limited interest to the protagonists mere sport   To correct this impression it suffices to consider some other psycho logical terms whose mythological inflections are somewhat different  Thymos for instance means soul spirit or anger like the anger of  Oedipus At first glance thymos has nothing in common with kudos  except for one trait which we would normally consider altogether  trivial its alternating character When a man possesses thymos he  possesses an irresistible dynamism When thymos is withdrawn he is  plunged into anguish and despair Thymos is derived from the verb  thuein which means to make smoke to offer sacrifices to act vio lently to run wild   The thymos comes and goes at the bidding of the thuein In fact  kudos and thymos represent two different and partial aspects of the  same problem It is not some vulgar trophy or secondrate divinity the  adversaries are trying to wrest from each others grasp but their very  souls their vital force their being Each finds this being reflected in  the others violence because their mimetic desires have converged on  one and the same object   Cyclothymia is the term psychiatrists use to designate the alternating  presence and absence of thymos Every case of cyclothymia is charac terized by mimetic desire and a strong competitive drive Psychiatrists  make the mistake of regarding cyclothymia as an essentially individual  phenomenon this is a genuinely mythical misconception identical to     From Mimetic Desire to the Monstrous Double 155   he delusion whereby men see all sudden reversals of Destiny all mani estations of divine anger as stemming from the action of a single hero  cf Oedipus the King An individual perspective on cyclothymia  fields only half the truth In all such cases when one person is high in  he favor of fortune another is low and vice versa   Modern psychiatry often fails to perceive the basic antagonism  inderlying the pathological manifestations of cyclothymia because all  races of conflict have vanished The physical violence even the harsh  anguage of the tragic confrontation no longer manifests itself the  idversary himself has disappeared or appears in a static form that  onceals the reality of the agonistic process The conflict seems to take  place in a domain far removed from the hurlyburly of competition  and strife In our own day literary or artistic creation would qualify as  such a domain for the romantic and modern artist generally claims to  draw his creations from the purest inner sources from a region uncon taminated by imitation In an age where the tyranny of fashion has  never been more absolute the artist proclaims his independence from  all outside influence   The tragic cyclothymia would engulf an increasing number of indi viduals if nothing intervened to stop it and would end by plunging the  whole community into madness and dissolution Thus we can easily  understand the terrified response of the chorus its frantic efforts to  remain uninvolved and avoid the contamination of mimetic rivalry  The virtues of moderation and common sense so dear to ordinary  mortals are openly challenged by the constant shiftings of the tragic  situation This timidity of the chorus offends the Romantic sensibilities  of modernday intellectuals who are scornful of any reluctance to  embrace what is forbidden by custom and law   Some will attribute the cautiousness of the Greek chorus to a pusil lanimous temperament already at this early date imbued with bour geois attitudes or else to an arbitrary and merciless superego We must  be careful to note however that it is not the sinful act in itself that  horrifies the chorus so much as the consequences of this act which the  chorus understands only too well The vertiginous oscillations of trag edy can shake the firmest foundations and bring the strongest houses  crashing to the ground   Fortunatelv even among modern readers there are some who do not  hold tragic conformism in scorn certain exceptional individuals who  have succeeded through genius and a good deal of pain in arriving at a  full appreciation of the tragic concept of peripeteia   At the very portals of madness Holderlin paused to question An tigone and Oedipus the King Swept up by the same vertiginous  movement that seized the heroes of Sophocles he tried desperately to     156 Violence and the Sacred   attain that state of moderate equilibrium celebrated by the chorus The  relationship between tragedy and Holderlins madness becomes clear if  we accept as literal facts the accounts of his existence set forth in the  poets own poems novels essays and letters The premises of madness  are sometimes neither more nor less than an exceptional encounter  with feelings appropriate to Greek tragedy an increasingly stressful  alternation between moments of superhuman exhaltation and hours  when only the emptiness and desolation of life holds any illusion of  reality The god bestows his presence on the poet only it seems to  withdraw it A thin thread of remembrance links these alternating  visitations and absences a thread just strong enough to assure the indi viduals sense of continuity and to sustain those visions of the past that  heighten the intoxication of possession but render even more painful  the anguish of loss A being who thought himself eternally damned  finds himself ecstatically involved in his own resurrection a being who  thought himself a god is struck with horror at the revelation of his self delusion The god is other and the poet though still alive is little  better than a corpse for he has lost all reason for living He is like a  sacrificial lamb dumbly submitting to the executioners knife   Holderlins god often bears a proper namesometimes the name of  the poet himself sometimes that of another Usually that other is at the  outset a woman who later assumes the features of a manthe poet  Schiller Contrary to what Jean Laplanche asserts there is no essential  difference between masculine and feminine attributions3 The idolized  antagonist undergoes first a feminine incarnation then a masculine  incarnation As the poets correspondence makes clear this substitution  is unrelated to any sexual difficulties On the contrary amatory success  deprives the sexual domain of its value as a test between the I and the  other   The constant shifting back and forth from divinity to nothingness in  Holderlins relationships with others is expressed in poetic mythic  quasireligious terms as well as in a perfectly rational form which is at  once the most deceptive and most revealing of all His letters to  Schiller lucidly describe the plight of the disciple who sees his model  transformed into an obstacle and rival   In his Thalia Fragment a first draft for the Hyperion Holderlin  writes   I imagined that the poverty of our nature would change to abundance  when two such wretched creatures men could share one heart a single  and indivisible life as if all the ills of our existence were brought about  by the dissolution of some primitive unity   3 Jean Laplanche Holderlin et la question du pere Paris 1961     From Mimetic Desire to the Monstrous Double 151   With melancholy rapture I can still sense it thinking of naught but  how to find someone to accept the gift of my loving smile of how to  give myself to the first passerby    Ah How often I then believed I  had encountered and possessed the Ineffable simply by having dared to  delve to the very depths of my love How often I believed I had been  granted direct access to the divine I called out called again and the  poor creature put in an appearance embarrassed ill at ease often even  slightly aggressivehe wanted only a little pleasure certainly nothing  very demanding   What a blind imbecile I was I was seeking pearls from beggars even  poorer than myself so very poor so sunken in poverty that they were  incapable of judging the extent of their misery and delighted in the rags  and tatters which covered their naked bodies      In fact when it seemed to me that the last remnants of my lost life  were at stake and when my pride began to revive I found that I had  become a mass of unleashed activity and I discovered in myself the  omnipotence of despair Whenever my wan and languishing spirit hap pened to imbibe an unexpected draught of happiness I flung myself  precipitously into the midst of the crowd spoke out in inspired tones  and sometimes even felt welling up in my eyes the tears of felicity Or  whenever the thought of image of a hero flashed across the dark firma ment of my soul I rejoiced in my surprise as if a god had seen fit to  visit my forlorn domain And it seemed to me then that a whole world  was about to take shape within me But the more suddenly these dor mant powers were stirred into awakening the more precipitous was  their subsequent decline and unsatiated nature experienced a redoubling  of afflictions   In a letter to Schiller Holderlin writes   I have sufficient courage and judgment to free myself from other  masters and critics and to pursue my own path with the tranquil spirit  necessary for such an endeavor but in regard to you my dependence is  insurmountable and because I know the profound effect a single word  from you can have on me I sometimes strive to put you out of my mind  so as not to be overcome by anxiety at my work For I am convinced  that such anxiety such worry is the death or art and I understand per fectly well why it is more difficult to give proper expression to nature  when the artist finds himself surrounded by masterpieces than when he  is virtually alone amidst the living world He finds himself too closely  involved with nature too intimately linked with it to consider the need  for rebelling against its authority or for submitting to it But this terrible  alternation is almost inevitable when the young artist is exposed to the  mature genius of a master which is more forceful and comprehensible  than nature and thus more capable of enslaving him It is not a case of  one child playing with another childthe primitive equilibrium attained  between the first artist and his world no longer holds The child is now     158 Violence and the Sacred   dealing with men with whom he will never in all probability be familiar  enough to forget their superiority And if he feels this superiority he  must become either rebellious or servile Or must he      When differences begin to shift back and forth the cultural order  loses its stability all its elements constantly exchange places So it is  that in tragedy the differences between the antagonists never vanish  entirely but are constantly inverted In such a system enemy broth ers can never occupy the same position at the same time Earlier I  defined this system in terms of abolished distinctions of symmetry and  reciprocity Now I am saying that differences never really disappear  The contradiction between the two definitions is I trust a contradic tion in appearance only   In a tragedy the reciprocal relationship between the characters is  real but it is the sum of nonreciprocal moments The antagonists never  occupy the same positions at the same time to be sure but they  occupy these positions in succession There is never anything on one  side of the system that cannot be found on the other side provided we  wait long enough The quicker the rhythm of reprisals the shorter the  wait The faster the blows rain down the clearer it becomes that there  is no difference between those who strike the blows and those who  receive them On both sides everything is equal not only the desire  the violence the strategy but also the alternation of victory and de feat of exaltation and despair Everywhere we encounter the same  cyclothymia   My original definition therefore holds and I trust that the concept  of shifting differences serves to refine it After all it is not the elimina tion of differences that lends itself to direct observation but the suc cessive inversion of differences In the temporal plan of the system  there is not a moment when those involved in the action do not see  themselves separated from their rivals by formidable differences  When one of the brothers assumes the role of father and king the  other cannot but feel himself to be the disinherited son That explains  why the antagonists only rarely perceive the reciprocal nature of their  involvement Each is too intensely engaged in living out his nonre ciprocal moment to grasp the whole picture to take in several of these  moments in a single glance and compare them in such a way as to  penetrate the illusory quality of singularity that each moment ob served in isolation seems to possessin a universe that otherwise ap pears commonplace banal without interest The same characters who  are blind to the phenomenon of reciprocity while they are caught up  in it perceive it all too well when they are not involved That is why  during the sacrificial crisis all men are endowed with the spirit of     From Mimetic Desire to the Monstrous Double 159   prophecya vainglorious wisdom that deserts them when they them selves are put to the test   Because they are essentially outsiders and therefore misread the  differences shifting back and forth between the antagonists Oedipus  Creon and Tiresias in turn imagine themselves capable of banishing  the plaguethat is of serving as arbitrator in the conflicts convulsing  Thebes Each thinks that he can make it clear to the antagonists that no  difference actually stands between them And each in turn is drawn  into the conflict whose contagiousness he failed to comprehend   From within the system only differences are perceived from with out the antagonists all seem alike From inside sameness is not visible  from outside differences cannot be seen   Only the outside perspective which takes into consideration reci procity and unity and denies the difference can discern the workings  of the violent resolution the cryptic process by which unanimity is re formed against and around the surrogate victim When all differences  have been eliminated and the similarity between two figures has been  achieved we say that the antagonists are doubles It is their inter changeability that makes possible the act of sacrificial substitution   My reading of Oedipus the King is based on this outside perspec tive on an objectivity that takes in at a glance the identity of all the  antagonists However the generative unanimity does not come from  outside It is produced by the antagonists themselves to whom the  objective outlook is utterly alien The preceding description then  cannot be sufficient In order for violent unanimity to become a pos sibilityin order that is for the sacrificial substitution to function  their own identity and reciprocity must somehow impose themselves  on the antagonists themselves and triumph within the confines of the  system Both the outside and inside viewpoints must communicate yet  remain distinct the misapprehension must remain within the system  for otherwise the polarization of violence onto the surrogate victim  could not be effected and the arbitrary choice of that victim would be  too readily evident   We must be prepared therefore to start our analysis afresh and try  to examine from within the mechanism responsible for sacrificial sub stitution in the crisisridden communitv   As I have said the differences that seem to separate the antagonists  shift ever faster and more abruptly as the crisis grows in intensity  Beyond a certain point the nonreciprocal moments succeed each other  with such speed that their actual passage becomes blurred They seem  to overlap forming a composite image in which all the previous  highs and lows the extremes that had previously stood out in bold  relief now seem to intersect and mingle Where formerly he had seen     160 Violence and the Sacred   his antagonist and himself as incarnations of unique and separate mo ments in the temporal scheme of things the subject now perceives two  simultaneous projections of the entire rime spanan effect that is al most cinematographic   Up to this point I have described the system in terms of single  unique difference the difference between the god and the non god This is clearly an oversimplification The Dionysiac state of  mind can and as we have seen often does erase all manner of differ ences familial cultural biological and natural The entire everyday  world is caught up in the whirl producing a hallucinatory state that is  not a synthesis of elements but a formless and grotesque mixture of  things that are normally separate   It is this monstrosity this extraordinary strangeness of the world  that captures the attention not only of the characters involved but also  of latterday scholars who till the fields of folklore and psychiatry An  attempt is made to classify the monsters but despite their initial dis parities they end by resembling one another no stable difference really  serves to separate them And there is really nothing very interesting to  say about the hallucinatory aspects of an experience that for all practi cal purposes exists solely to divert attention from the essential fact  which is that the antagonists are truly doubles   A fundamental principle often overlooked is that the double and  the monster are one and the same being The myth of course empha sizes only one aspect usually the monstrous aspect in order to mini mize the other There is no monster who does not tend to duplicate  himself or to marry another monster no double who does not yield  a monstrous aspect upon close scrutiny4 The duality claims prece dencewithout however eliminating the monstrous and in the  duality of the monster the true structure of the experience is put in  relief The nature of the relationship between monster and double  stubbornly denied by the antagonists is ultimately imposed on them in  the course of the shifting of differencesbut it is imposed in the  form of a hallucination The unity and reciprocity that the enemy  brothers have rejected in the benign form of brotherly love finally  impose themselves both from without and within in the form of  monstrous

reciprocal char icter its affinity with violence Psychoanalysts and folklorists declare  that these hallucinatory phenomena are purely imaginary They refuse  to acknowledge the reality of the symmetry that underlies the fantasy  This transformation of the real into the unreal is part of the process by  which man conceals from himself the human origin of his own vio lence by attributing it to the gods To say that the monstrous double is  a god or that he is purely imaginary is to say the same thing in differ ent terms Our abstract skepticism visavis religion serves admirably  to fill the function formerly performed by religion itself   To mv knowledge only Dostoevsky both in his early novel The  Double and in the masterpieces of his maturity has set forth in con crete terms the elements of reciprocity at work in the proliferation of  monsters   In the collective experience of the monstrous double the differences  are not eliminated but muddied and confused All the doubles are  interchangeable although their basic similarity is never formally ac knowledged They thus occupy the equivocal middle ground between  difference and unity that is indispensable to the process of sacrificial  substitutionto the polarization of violence onto a single victim who  substitutes for all the others The monstrous double gives the antag onists incapable of perceiving that nothing actually stands between  them or their reconciliation precisely what they need to arrive at  the compromise that involves unanimity minus the victim of the gen erative expulsion The monstrous double

accompanies the primordial religious experience When violent  hysteria reaches a peak the monstrous double looms up everywhere at  once The decisive act of violence is directed against this awesome  vision of evil and at the same time sponsored by it The turmoil then  gives way to calm hallucinations vanish and the detente that follows  only heightens the mystery of the whole process In an instant all  extremes have met all differences fused superhuman exemplars of     162 Violence and the Sacred   violence and peace have in that instant coincided Modern pathological  experiences offer no such catharsis but although religious and patho logical experiences cannot be equated they share certain similarities    Q  4 M  N Y LITERARY TEXTS both ancient and modern  make reference to the double to duality to double visionreferences  that have long been disregarded In The Bacchae the monstrous dou ble is everywhere As we have seen from the opening of the play  animal human and divine are caught up in a frenetic interchange  beasts are mistaken for men or gods gods and men mistaken for beasts  Perhaps the most intriguing instance of this confusion occurs during  the encounter between Dionysus and Pentheus shortly before Pen theus is murderedthat is at the very moment when the enemy  brother is due to disappear behind the form of the monstrous double   And that is exactly what happens Pentheus has already fallen prey  to Dionysiac vertigo he sees double   Pentheus I seem to see two suns two Thebes with two times seven  gates And you you are a bull walking before rne with two horns  sprouting from your head   Dionysus You see what you ought to see   In this extraordinary exchange the theme of the double appears ini tially in a form completely exterior to the subject as a double vision of  inanimate objects an attack of dizziness Here we are dealing solely  with hallucinatory elements they are undeniably a part of the experi ence but only a part and not the essential one As the passage unfolds  so too does its meaning Pentheus associates the double vision with the  vision of the monster Dionysus is at once man god and bull The  reference to the bulls horns links the two themes doubles are always  monstrous and duality is always an attribute of monsters   Dionysuss words are arresting You see ivhat you ought to see  By seeing double by seeing Dionysus himself as a monster bearing the  double seal of duality and bestiality Pentheus conforms to the im mutable rules of the game Master of the game the god makes sure that  events take their course according to his plan The plan is identical to  the process we have just described with the monstrous double making  his appearance at the height of the crisis just before the unanimous  resolution   These lines become even more intriguing when read in conjunction  with the passage that follows Now we have to reckon not with hal lucination or vertigo but with real flesh and blood doubles The identi cal nature of the antagonists is explicidy formulated     From Mimetic Desire to the Monstrous Double 163   Fentheus Tell me who do I look like Like Ino or like my mother  Agaue   Dionysus You seem the very image of them both   Similarities are at the heart of the encounter but the question is  treated ambiguously in terms of family resemblancea formulation  brought to mind by Pentheus transvestite masquerade Yet something  more is clearly at stake here Surely it is the similarity of doubles that  is being suggested that of the surrogate victim and the community  that expells it of the sacrificed and the sacrificer All differences are  abolished You seem the very image of them both once again it is  the god himself who confirms the basic principles of a process initiated  by him and which in fact comes to seem a sign of his presence    Q A j  THE WRITINGS OF ANOTHER ANCIENT AU thor are equally vital I believe to a discussion of the monstrous  double Empedocles description of the birth of monsters has never been  adequately interpreted However if the cycles described by the philoso pher correspond to a cultural system founded on an act of generative  violence maintained by ritual and destroyed by a new sacrificial crisis  then we can scarcely doubt that the birth of monsters as described by  him is meant to suggest terrible apparition of the monstrous double The  author attributes the cyclical movement to the alternation of two funda mental impulses Love and Hate The birth of monsters come about  through the attraction of like for like under the aegis not of Love but  of Hate before the birth of a nenx world   57 Then there began to sprout in profusion heads without necks and  arms without bodies or shoulders swarmed everywhere and naked eyes  floated as planets in the world of Hate  58 The dismembered limbs subservient to the will of Hate wander  about separately yearning to unite  59 But as soon as a god draws closer in harmony to another god the  limbs begin to link up at random and they all rush together  60 We find creatures with revolving legs and coundess hands  61 Others are born with two faces two torsos there are cows with  human heads and men with the heads of cows and hermaphrodites  whose sex is shrouded in mystery   The interpretation I propose happens to coincide with the recent  tendency to reject physical interpretations of preSocratic thought  interpretations that are to be sure always dependent on the belief that  the primary purpose of myths is to explain natural phenomena Al though the more recent interpretations are superior to the early ones     164 Violence and the Sacred   they still I believe underestimate the religious element in the thinking  of Empedocles and indeed in all the preSocratics   My attempt to link the passage from Empedocles with the phe nomenon of the monstrous double may seem less farfetched if we  consider this passage in conjunction with another work of Empedocles  Purifications I alluded to this work earlier on but it seems to take on  new significance in this context The father takes hold of his son who  has changed form and in a fit of madness sacrifices him the son cries  out but his pleas fall on deaf ears the demented father cuts the sons  throat and prepares an abominable feast in his palace Similarly the  son seizes the father and the children of their mother kills them all and  devours their flesh   Whether or not we choose to take this passage literally it under scores the atmosphere of acute sacrificial crisis that was the back ground for Empedocles work The father kills his son who has  changed form just as Agaue kills her son who has changed form  mistaking him for a lion and just as Pentheus mistakes Dionysus for a  bull As in The Bacchae we are witnessing the degeneration of a rite  into a form of reciprocal violence that is so irrational it conjures up the  monstrous double That is it harkens back to the very origins of the  rite and thus closes the circle of religious compositions and decomposi tions that preoccupied the preSocratics    G   THE APPARITION OF THE MONSTROUS DOU ble cannot be verified empirically nor for that matter can the body  of phenomena that forms the basis for any primitive religion Despite  the texts cited above the monstrous double remains a hypothetical  creation as do the other phenomena associated with the mechanism  that determines the choice of surrogate victim The validity7 of the  hypothesis is confirmed however by the vast number of mythological  ritualistic philosophical and literary motifs that it is able to explain as  well as by the quality7 of the explanations by the coherence it imposes  on phenomena that until now appeared isolated and obscure   My hypothesis permits me to essay an explanation of two sets of  phenomena that are among the most puzzling in all human culture  possession and the ritual use of masks   Under the heading monstrous double we shall group all the hal lucinatory phenomena provoked at the height of the crisis by unrec ognized reciprocity The monstrous double is also to be found  wherever we encounter an I and an Other caught up in a constant  interchange of differences The same set of images is projected almost  simultaneously in two symmetrical locations In The Bacchae we dis cover two types of phenomena that are capable of rapid interchange     From Mimetic Desire to the Monstrous Double 165   The subject of the action Pentheus at first sees the two series of  images as exterior to himself this is the phenomenon of double vi sion A moment later one of the two series is perceived as not me  and the other as me It is this second experience we are referring to  wrhen we use the term double It is a direct extension of the previous  stages and it retains the concept of an antagonist exterior to the sub jecta concept crucial to an understanding of possession   The subject watches the monstrosity that takes shape within him  and outside him simultaneously In his efforts to explain what is hap pening to him he attributes the origin of the apparition to some ex terior cause Surely he thinks this vision is too bizarre to emanate  from the familiar country within too foreign in fact to derive from  the world of men The whole interpretation of the experience is domi nated by the sense that the monster is alien to himself   The subject feels that the most intimate regions of his being have  been invaded by a supernatural creature who also besieges him with out Horrified he finds himself the victim of a double assault to which  he cannot respond Indeed how can one defend oneself against an  enemy who blithely ignores all barriers between inside and outside  This extraordinary freedom of movement permits the godor spirit  or demonto seize souls at will The condition called possession is in  fact but one particular interpretation of the monstrous double   It is hardly surprising that possession should often take the form of a  hysterical mimesis The subject seems to be responding to some outside  influence he has the jerky movements of a marionette Some presence  seems to be acting through hima god a monster or whatever crea ture is in the process of investing his body He is caught in the double  bind of the modelobstacle that condemns both partners to a continual  heightening of violence The monstrous double now takes the place of  those objects that held the attention of the antagonists at a less ad vanced stage of the crisis replacing those things that each had sought  to assimilate and destroy to incarnate and expel Possession then is an  extreme form of alienation in which the subject totally absorbs the  desires of another   The possessed subject bellows like Dionysus the bull like a lion he is  ready to devour anyone who ventures within sight He can even im personate inanimate objects He is at the same time one and many  beings as he reenacts the hysterical trance and the crazy mixture of  differences that immediately precedes the collective expulsion There  exist entire sects devoted to possession with their own group sessions  It is interesting to note that in colonial countries or oppressed societies  it is often the representatives of the dominant powerthe governor general or the sentry at the barracks gatewho serve as models     166 Violence and the Sacred   Possession like everything pertaining to primordial religious experi ence tends to acquire a ritual character The existence of a ritual form  of possession implies that something in the nature of an intense case of  collective possession took place initially for it is of course that spon taneous occurrence that the ritual is striving to reproduce Ritual pos session seems inseparable at first from the sacrificial rites that serve as  its culmination In principle the religious practices follow the order of  the cycle of violence they are attempting to imitate Such is the case  with the Dinka in those occasional instances in which possession pre cedes the immolation of the victim As soon as the excitement aroused  by the chants dances and mock combats has reached a certain pitch of  intensity the ritual imprecations pass over into signs of possession As  Lienhardt recounts it5 first young men then adult men and women  are overcome They stagger about among their companions then fall  to the ground in convulsions moaning or emitting piercing cries   In some sects possession is regarded as beneficial in others as harm ful And there are still others that consider possession beneficial or  harmful depending on the circumstances Behind these diverse atti tudes lies a problem of interpretation similar to the one we have dis cussed in connection with ritual incest and with festivals In dealing  with liberating violence religion can choose either faithfully to reenact  the all too characteristic phenomena of the crisis or systematically to  ignore them The phenomenon of possession therefore can appear as  sickness cure or both at once   As the rites disintegrate some of the elements that formed them tend  to disappear Others assume new identities divorced from their past  context Possessions like many other aspects of primordial experience  can become the chief object of religious preoccupation In such cases  possession cults arise The group sessions of the cult find their climax  in an act of sacrificial slaughter6 At a later stage of the cult the  sacrifice disappears from the rites The shamans then try to utilize  possession for rnagicomedical purposes They become specialists in  the practice of possession   K3 STILL ANOTHER RITUAL PRACTICE acquires  fresh significance in the light of investigations into the monstrous  double the ritual use of masks   Masks are among the necessary tools of many primitive sects but we  cannot answer with certainty the questions raised by their presence  What do they represent What is their purpose How did they orig inate Surely there must be some unifying factor some criterion for   5 Godfrey Lienhardt Divinity and Experience pp 13637 274 et passim  6Cf Jeanmaires description of the Zar and Bori Dionysos pp 11931     From Mimetic Desire to the Monstrous Double 161   masks among the great variety of forms and styles something we can  recognize if not define After all whenever we encounter a mask we  do not hesitate to identify it as such The unity of the mask cannot be  extrinsic it exists in societies remote from each other in space and  culture and it cannot be traced to a single geographical locus The  almost universal use of masks is often said to answer some deepseated  esthetic need Primitive people we are told are obsessed with dis guises they also have a compulsion to create forms   This kind of art criticism offers no real answer to the problem of  masks Primitive art after all is fundamentally religious And masks  will undoubtedly therefore serve a religious function They are cer tainly not pure inventions their models vary greatly from culture to  culture but certain traits remain constant Although it would not be  correct to say that masks invariably represent the human face they are  almost always associated with it designed to cover the face to replace  it or in some way to substitute for it   The problem of the unity and diversity of masks is the same as that  of the unity and diversity of myths and rituals It undoubtedly origi nates in some real experience common to a large portion of humanity  but now lost to us   Like the festival in which it often plays an important role the mask  displays combinations of forms and colors incompatible with a differ entiated order that is not primarily that of nature but of the culture  itself The mask mixes man and beast god and inanimate object Victor  Turner makes reference to a ndembu mask that represents at once a  human face and a meadow7 iMasks juxtapose beings and objects sepa rated by differences They are beyond differences they do not merely  defy differences or efface them but they incorporate and rearrange  them in original fashion In short they are another aspect of the mon strous double   The ritual ceremonies that require the use of masks are reenactments  of the original experience In many cases the celebrants at least those  who play the most important role in the ceremony don masks at the  climax of the rite just before the sacrifice These rites permit the  participants to play out all the roles performed by their ancestors  during the original crisis They are enemies first engaging in mock  combats and symmetrical dances then they put on their masks and  change into monstrous doubles The mask is no apparition drawn from  the thin air it is a transformation of the antagonists normal features  The different modes of its ritual use the structure within which the  masks operate are in most cases more revealing than any terms their   7 Victor Turner The Forest of Symbols Aspects of Ndembu Ritual Ithaca  NY 1970 p 105     168 Violence and the Sacred   wearers may use to describe them If the mask is intended to conceal  human faces at a fixed point in the ritual that is because this is what  happened to human faces the first time Masks then serve as an inter pretation and concrete representation of phenomena that we described  previously in purely theoretical terms   There is no point in trying to determine whether masks represent  human or supernatural beings An inquiry of that kind is relevant only  to later developments of the ritual brought about by a further ac centuation of differences a deepening misapprehension of the phe nomena that the ritualistic use of masks allows the wearers to reenact  Masks stand at that equivocal frontier between the human and the  divine between a differentiated order in the process of disintegra tion and its final undifferentiated statethe point where all differences  all monstrosities are concentrated and from which a new order will  emerge There is no point in trying to determine the nature of  masks because it is in their nature not to have a nature but to encom pass all natures   Greek tragedy like the festival and indeed all other rites is pri marily a representation of the sacrificial crisis and the generative  violence The use of masks in the Greek theater requires therefore no  special explanation the masks serve the same role as they do elsewhere  Masks disappear when the monsters once again assume human form  when tragedy completely forgets its ritual origins That is not to say  of course that tragedy ceases to play a sacrificial role in the broad  sense On the contrary it has taken over the role of ritual     GS3 Chapter Seven   Freud and the  Oedipus Complex   c   g y l  WE CAN OBSERVE both similarities and differences    J  N  between the mimetic desire described in the previous   chapter and Freuds Oedipus complex Mimetism is a source of con tinual conflict By making one mans desire into a replica of another  mans desire it invariably leads to rivalry and rivalry in turn transforms  desire into violence Although Freud may appear on first glance to have  ignored this mechanism he in fact came very close to apprehending it  A rigorous examination of this text will make it clear why he ultimately  failed to do so   The mimetic nature of desire plays an important role in Freuds  worknot important enough however to dominate and revolutionize  his thinking His mimetic intuitions are incompletely formulated they  constitute a dimension of his text that is only half visible and tends to  disappear in transmission There is nothing surprising about the refusal  of presentday psychoanalysts to turn their attention to this subject  Factions of psychoanalytic thought bitterly opposed in other respects  are here at one The mimetic aspect of desire has been ignored at once  by those whose main concern is the elimination of inconsistencies in  Freuds work in favor of a unified whole and by that other group who  while orthodox Freudians in name quietly reject some of the most  lucid and cogent of Freuds analyses on the grounds that they are  tainted with psychologism   Although traces of the mimetic conception are scattered through  Freuds work this conception never assumes a dominant role It runs  counter to the Freudian insistence on a desire that is fundamentally  directed toward an object that is sexual desire for the mother When  the tension between these opposing tendencies becomes too great both  Freud and his disciples seem to resolve it in favor of the objectdesire   The mimetic intuition of Freud gives rise to a series of concepts  ambiguous in definition obscure in status and vague in function  Among the offshoots of this illdefined mimetic desire are certain con  169     110 Violence and the Sacred   cepts that come under the heading identification Among the cate gories of Freudian identification one that nowadays receives little  attention is the first one discussed in the chapter entitled Identifica tion in Group Psychology and the Afialysis of the Ego This cate gory has to do with the father A little boy will exhibit a special  interest in his father he would like to grow like and be like him and  take his place everywhere We may say simply that he takes his father  as his ideal This behavior has nothing to do with a passive or feminine  attitude towards his father and towards males in general it is on the  contrary typically masculine It fits in very well with the Oedipus  complex for which it helps to prepare the way1   There is a clear resemblance between identification with the father  and mimetic desire both involve the choice of a model The choice is  not really determined by parentage for the child can select as model  any man who happens to fill the role that our society normally assigns  to the natural father   As we have pointed out in the previous chapter the mimetic model  directs the disciples desire to a particular object by desiring it himself  That is why we can say that mimetic desire is rooted neither in the  subject nor in the object but in a third party whose desire is imitated  by the subject Granted the passage quoted above is hardly explicit on  this point But its implications are clear and conform to our definition  of mimetic desire Freud asserts that the identification has nothing  passive or feminine about it a passive or feminine identification would  mean that the son wanted to become the object of his fathers desire  How then will the active and typically masculine identification re alize itself Either it is wholly imaginary or it finds concrete form in  the desire for some particular object The identification is a desire to  be the model that seeks fulfillment naturally enough by means of  appropriation that is by taking over the things that belong to his  father As Freud says the son seeks to take the father s place every where he thus seeks to assume his desires to desire what the father  desires The proof that we are not distorting Freuds intention is sup plied by the last sentence of the passage The identification fits  very well with the Oedipus complex for which it helps to prepare the  way   What can this sentence mean if not that identification directs desire  toward those objects desired by the father We have here an undeni able instance of filial desire undergoing the influence of mimesis Con  1 Sigmund Freud The Standard Edition of the Complete Psychological Works  of Sigtmtnd Freud ed and trans James Strachey 24 vols London 195366  vol 18 Group Psychology and the Afialysis of the Ego p 105     Freud and the Oedipus Complex 111   sequently there already exists in Freuds thought at this stage a latent  conflict between this mimetic process of paternal identification and the  autonomous establishment of a particular object as a basis for desire  the sexual cathexis toward the mother   This conflict is all the more apparent because identification with the  father is presented as fundamental to the boys development anterior  to aiy choice of object Freud emphasizes this point in the opening  sentences of an analysis that will eventually unfold into an overall  description of the Oedipus complex and that is to be found in the  chapter on identification previously referred to2 After identification  with the father comes the sexual cathexis toward the mother which  according to Freud first appears and develops independently The  objectchoice of the mother appears to have its origins in two factors  first the identification with the father the mimesis second the fixa tion of the libido on the mother These two forces act together and  reinforce one another as Freud makes clear a few lines further on  After having subsisted side by side for a time without any mutual  influence or interference the two come together at last and the  libidinal drive is thereby strengthened This is a wholly natural and  logical turn of events if we choose to regard this identification as the  mimesis of paternal desire Indeed once we have seen matters in this  light all other explanations seem irrelevant   1 am not trying to put words in Freuds mouth In fact it is my  contention that Freud saw the path of mimetic desire stretching out  before him and deliberately turned aside One need only examine his  definition of the Oedipus complex which follows a few lines further  on to see how he evades the issue The little boy notices that his  father stands in his way with his mother His identification with his  father takes on a hostile colouring and becomes identical with the wish  to replace his father in regard to his mother as well Identification in  fact is ambivalent from the very first 3   The passage contains at least one point well worth noting When  as Freud explains the son discovers that his father is becoming an  obstacle to him his identification fuses with his desire to replace his  father in regard to his mother as well That as well rivets the  attention Freud has earlier defined identification as the desire to re place the father and he now repeats that formula Must we therefore  conclude that the mother was initially excluded implicitly or explic itly from the program On examining the definition we see nothing  that suggests such an exclusion quite the contrary As Freud has put   2 Ibid  3 Ibid     112 Violence and the Sacred   it The little boy will exhibit a special interest in his father he would  like to growr like and be like him and take his place everywhere italics  added   The casual reader may well assume that the uas well in the phrase  in regard to the mother as well is merely a slip of the pen after all if  the son wants to replace his father everywhere it follows that he  would want to replace him in regard to the mother But this apparent  triviality in phrasing conceals an important point As we have seen it is  impossible to elucidate Freuds theory of identification without en countering a mimetic mechanism that makes the father into the desire model It is the father who directs the sons attention to desirable  objects by desiring them himself thus the boys desires are inevitably  directed toward his own mother This much is clearly implied by  Freuds text yet these conclusions are never made explicit Of course  it is possible that they never took shape in his mind though they must  surely have hovered there in some form when he was writing the  opening passages of chapter 7 Identification Having first implied a  mimetic interpretation Freud then rejected it also by implication  with the phrase his mother as well Such is the hidden meaning of  that as well The two words retrospectively neutralize any mimetic  interpretation of identification at least in regard to the object of pri mary importancethe mother   Freuds eagerness to dispell the mimetic elements that were imping ing on his Oedipus theory can readily be discerned in his later work  Here for instance is his definition of the Oedipus complex as stated in  The Ego and the Id 1923   At a very early age the little boy develops an objectcathexis for his  mother     the boy deals with his father by identifying himself with  him For a time these two relationships proceed side by side until the  boys sexual wishes in regard to his mother become more intense and his  father is perceived as an obstacle to them from this the Oedipus com plex originates His identification with his father then takes on a hostile  colouring and changes into a wish to get rid of his father in order to  take his place with his mother Henceforward his relation to his father  is ambivalent it seems as if the ambivalence inherent in the identifica tion from the beginning had become manifest4   At first glance this looks like a faithful resume of the concepts set  forth in Group Psychology and the Analysis of the Ego A further  examination reveals certain differences that though apparently minor  are in reality very important My previous analysis dealt specifically  with the mimetic elements to be found in the earlier text It is precisely   4 Freud Standard Edition vol 19 The Ego and the Id pp 3132     Freud and the Oedipus Complex 775   those elements relegated to the shadows in that earlier description of  the Oedipus complex that are banished entirely from this later defini tion   In the earlier text Freud insists on the anteriority of the identifica tion with the father In the later text he does not explicitly repudiate  this doctrine but he gives first mention to the sons sexual attraction to  the mother In short he discourages us from thinking that one and the  same impulsethe wish to take the fathers place everywherestimu lates identification with the model and directs desire toward the  mother   That this inversion of the original order is not a matter of chance  becomes abundantly clear when the process is repeated a little further  on In the second text we find that the formulation of the complex  is preceded by the reinforcement of the sexual wish but instead of  presenting this reinforcement as a consequence of the boys first identi fication with the father Freud inverts the order of the phenomena  thereby formally rejecting the causeandeffect relationship suggested  initially This reinforcement of the libido is now totally lacking in  motivation The effect is retained but because it now precedes the  cause neither cause nor effect seems to make much sense As we can  see in The Ego and the Id Freud makes a clean sweep of all mimetic  effects but in so doing he sacrifices some of the most trenchant in sights of Group Psychology and the Analysis of the Ego and some of  his coherence as well   Why did Freud banish mimesis from his later work The best way  to reply to this question is to continue along the path abandoned by  him to discover where he might have gone had he chosen to be guided  by those mimetic effects that abounded in his earher analyses but that  were swept away as if by magic the instant they were found to cast  doubt on his Oedipus complex We must in short return to that  phrase that is surreptitiously contradicted and canceled out by the  mother as well To identify with the father Freud informed us is  first of all to want to replace him the little boy would like to grow  like and be like him and take his place everywhere italics added   In order to exclude the mother from this everywhere it is neces sary to assume that the son is already conscious of the law and that  he conforms to it without any prior instruction for in principle it is  the father who is supposed to teach him But to exclude the mother is  in actuality to assert that the Oedipus complex is already in operation  if that is not true the mother should be included and that is what  Freud has doneinitially The comprehensiveness of the statement  that the son wishes to take his fathers place everywhere is wholly  appropriate for the son cannot have a clear and distinct impression of     174 Violence and the Sacred   his fathers objectsincluding the motherinsofar as they are indeed  his fathers In short if the son turns toward his fathers objects it is  because he is following the example of his model and this model neces sarily turns toward his own objectsthose that are already in his  possession or that he hopes to acquire The disciples movement toward  the objects of his model including the mother is already accounted  for by the concept of identification as defined by Freud Far from  discouraging such an interpretation Freud seems initially to have en couraged it   Because disciple and model are converging on the same object a  clash between them is inevitable The resulting rivalry appears Oedi pal but it takes on a wholly different meaning Because it is pre determined by the models choice there is nothing fortuitous about it  nor is it strictly speaking a question of one persons usurping what  belongs to the other The disciples attraction to the models object is  wholly innocent in seeking to take his fathers place with his  mother as well the son is simply responding in all candor to a  command issued by the culture in which he lives and by the model  himself If we pause to consider closely the modeldisciple relationship  it should become clear that the socalled Oedipal rivalry reinterpreted  in terms of a radically mimetic situation must logically result in con sequences that are at once similar to and quite different from those  attributed by Freud to his complex   Earlier on I defined the effects of mimetic rivalry and affirmed that  they invariably end in reciprocal violence This reciprocity is the re sult of a process If there is a stage in human existence at which  reciprocity is not yet in operation and at which reprisals are impos sible that stage is surely early childhood That is why children are so  vulnerable The adult is quick to sense a violent situation and answer  violence with violence the child on the other hand never having been  exposed to violence reaches out for his models objects with unsus pecting innocence Only an adult could interpret the childs actions in  terms of usurpation Such an interpretation comes from the depths of a  cultural system to which the child does not yet belong one that is  based on cultural concepts of which the child has not the remotest  notion   The modeldisciple relationship precludes by its very nature that  sense of equality that would permit the disciple to see himself as a  possible rival to the model The disciples position is like that of a  worshiper before his god he imitates the others desires but is incapa ble of recognizing any connection between them and his own desires  In short the disciple fails to grasp that he can indeed enter into com petition with his model and even become a menace to him If this is     Freud and the Oedipus Complex 115   true for adults how much truer it must be for the child experiencing  his first encounter with mimetic desire   The models very first nohowever softly spoken or cautiously  phrasedcan easily be mistaken by the disciple for an irrevocable act  of excommunication a banishment to the realms of outer darkness  Because the child is incapable of meeting violence with violence and has  in fact had no real experience with violence his first encounter with  the mimetic double bind may well leave an indelible impression The  father projects into the future the first tentative movements of his  son and sees that they lead straight to the mother or the throne The  incest wish the patricide wish do not belong to the child but spring  from the mind of the adult the model In the Oedipus myth it is the  oracle that puts such ideas into Laiuss head long before Oedipus him self was capable of entertaining any ideas at all Freud reinvokes the  same ideas which are no more valid than Laiuss The son is always the  last to learn that what he desires is incest and patricide and it is  the hypocritical adults who undertake to enlighten him in this matter   The first intervention by the model between the disciple and the  object is a traumatic experience because the disciple is incapable of  performing the intellectual operation assigned him by the adult and in  particular by Freud himself He fails to see the model as a rival and  therefore has no desire to usurp his place Even the adult disciple is  unable to grasp that conflict with the model is indeed rivalry is unable  to perceive the symmetry of their situation or acknowledge their basic  equality Faced with the models anger the disciple feels compelled to  make some sort of choice between himself and the model and it is  perfectly clear that he will choose in favor of the model The idols  wrath must be justified and it can only be justified by some failure on  the part of the disciple some hidden weakness that obliges the god to  forbid access to the holy of holies to slam shut the gates of paradise  Far from reducing the divinitys prestige this new attitude of vengeful  spite serves to increase it The disciple feels guiltythough of what he  cannot be sureand unworthy of the object of his desire which now  appears more alluring than ever Desire has now been redirected  toward those particular objects protected by the others violence The  link between desire and violence has been forged and in all likelihood  it will never be broken   Freud too wants to show that an indelible impression is made on the  child when he first discovers his own desires overlapping those of his  parents But because he eventually rejected the mimetic elements that  had initially intrigued him he takes a different approach To appreci ate this difference let us look again at that crucial passage in Group  Psychology and the Analysis of the Ego uThe little boy notices that     116 Violence and the Sacred   his father stands in his way with his mother His identification with his  father then takes on a hostile colouring and becomes identical with the  wish to replace his father in regard to his mother as well   If we are to believe Freud the little boy has no difficulty recogniz ing his father as a rivala rival in the oldfashioned theatrical sense a  nuisance a hindrance a terzo incommodo But even if this rivalry were  provoked by something other than a desire to imitate the fathers  desires a child would be unaware of this We have only to look at the  numerous everyday displays of envy and jealousy to realize that even  adults never attribute their mutual antagonisms to that simple phenom enon Freud is thus conferring on the child powers of discernment not  equal but superior to those of most grownups   Let me make myself clear I am not objecting to certain basic Freud ian assumptions such as the attribution to the child of libidinal desires  similar to those of adults but rather to the bold and surely untenable  assertion which stands at the very center of his system that the child  is fully aware of the existing rivalry of the hostile colouring   Undoubtedly I am flying in the face of psychoanalytical orthodoxy  denying the alleged evidence of clinical findings and before the  doctors scientific mystique the layman can only bow But the texts we  have been examining are based on no specific clinical findings Their  speculative character is obvious and there is no more reason to treat  them as holy writ as some have done than to try to sweep them  under the carpet In either case we would be depriving ourselves of  some valuable insights even if the object of these insights is not al ways what Freud takes it to be and depriving ourselves as well of the  fascinating spectacle of Freuds intellect at work of the gradual and  halting evolution of Freudian doctrine   Undoubtedly clinical findings can be turned to almost any ac count but we can hardly expect them to serve as evidence for a  consciousness no matter how transitory of patricidal or incestuous  desire After all it is precisely because this consciousness refuses to  yield to clinical observation that Freud is obliged to devise such un wieldy and dubious concepts as those of the unconscious or sup pression   And here we arrive at my principal complaint against Freud The  mythical element of Freudianism has nothing to dodespite traditional  assertions to the contrarywith the nonconscious nature of those basic  impulses that determine the individuals psychological makeup If my  complaint were a reiteration of that wellworn theme it would un doubtedly be classified among the reactionary criticism of Freudian ism In the final analysis what I object to most is Freuds obstinate  attachmentdespite all appearancesto a philosophy of consciousness     Freud and the Oedipus Complex 777   The mythical aspect of Freudianism is founded on the conscious  knowledge of patricidal and incestuous desire only a brief flash of  consciousness to be sure a bright wedge of light between the darkness  of the first identifications and the unconsciousbut consciousness all  the same Freuds stubborn attachment to this consciousness compels  him to abandon both logic and credibility He first assumes this con sciousness and then gets rid of it in a kind of safedeposit box the  unconscious In effect he is saying ego can suppress all consciousness  of a patricidal and incestuous desire only if at one time ego truly  experienced it Ergo sum   The most remarkable aspect of this moment of unobstructed con sciousness which Freud posits as the basis for mans psychic existence  is its sheer uselessness Only by stripping it away do we uncover  Freuds essential point the crucial and potentially catastrophic nature  of the first contacts between child and parent or in other terms be tween the disciples desire and the models desire This moment of  consciousness not only offers us nothing of importance but also serves  to obscure the mimetic process which in both form and context pos sesses many advantages over the Freudian complex   Further discussion along these lines might distract us from our main  subject of inquiry so I shall only say in passing that I believe that a  radically mimetic conception of desire offers a novel approach to  psychiatric theory one as far removed from the Freudian unconscious  as it is from any philosophy of consciousness camouflaged as an exis tential psychoanalysis Specifically this new approach succeeds in  circumventing the fetish of adjustment without plunging into the  inverse fetish of perversion that is typical of so much of modern  theory The individual who adjusts has managed to relegate the two  contradictory injunctions of the double bindto imitate and not to  imitateto two different domains of application That is he divides  reality in such a way as to neutralize the double bind This is precisely  the procedure of primitive cultures At the origin of any individual or  collective adjustment lies concealed a certain arbitrary violence The  welladjusted person is thus one who conceals his violent impulses and  condones the collectives concealment of them The maladjusted in dividual cannot tolerate this concealment Mental illness5 and rebel lion like the sacrificial crisis they resemble commit the individual to  falsehoods and to forms of violence that are certainly more damaging  to him than the disguised violence channeled through sacrificial rites  but that bring him closer to the heart of the enigma Many psychic   5 Because the very notion of mental illness has been up to a point correctly  challenged in the writings of some contemporary physicians I put the term in  quotation marks     118 Violence and the Sacred   catastrophes misunderstood by the psychoanalyst result from an in choate obstinate reaction against the violence and falsehood found in  any human society   A psychoanalytic system that no longer oscillated between the rigid  conformism of social adjustment and the false scandal arising from the  assumption of a mythical patricideincest drive in the child would not  result in mere tepid idealism Rather such a system would bring us  face to face with some traditional concepts that are troubling to say  the least For example in Greek tragedy as in the Old Testament the  good son cannot generally be distinguished from the bad son the  good son is Jacob rather than Esau the prodigal son rather than  the faithful son Oedipus   For the good son imitates the father with  such passion that father and son become each others chief stumbling  blocka situation the indifferent son more easily avoids   It may appear at this point that all these concerns are foreign to the  Freudian mode of thought and that the mimetic double bind has noth ing to do with Freudian theory xct like your modeldo not act like  your modelthe contradictory double imperative we see as funda mentalmay be thought to lead us far from the realms of psycho analysis   In reality it does not and this shows that Freuds work is too pre cious to be left to the psychoanalysts The mimetic approach preserves  and enhances Freuds most acute insights In The Ego and the Id Freud  explains that the relation between the ego and the superego is not  exhausted by the precept You ought to be like this like your fa ther7 It also comprises the prohibition You may not be like this  like your fatherthat is you may not do all that he does some  things are his prerogative    6   Who after reading this passage can deny Freuds proximity to my  mimetic double bind Not only was he familiar with its operation but  the context in which he placed it can help us realize its full potential  Freuds definition of the superego presupposes something quite differ ent from a mythical consciousness of rivalry he seems to have based it  on the models identification with the obstacle an identification unper ceived by the disciple The superego is in fact nothing more than a  resumption of identification with the father now appearing chrono logically after the Oedipus complex rather than before it As we have  seen Freud did not actually suppress this previous identification per haps because he balked at contradicting himself but he cunningly  relegated it to secondary status by eliminating its primordial character   6Freud The Ego and the Id p 32     Freud and the Oedipus Complex 119   In any case the identification with the father now operates chiefly  after the complex has taken hold it has become the superego   If we reflect on the definition of the superego offered by Freud two  facts become clear In the first place the definition accords with the  concept of the double bind In the second place it fails to harmonize  with Freuds picture of a sublimated Oedipus complex that is a  patricideincest desire that has been transposed from the conscious to  the unconscious   To appreciate in full the predicament brought about by the super egos contradictory commands issued as they are in the atmosphere of  ignorance and uncertainty implied by Freuds definition we must try  to imagine the sons initial act of imitation It is performed with fervor  and devotion and rewarded by sudden stupefying disgrace The posi tive injunction Be like your father had seemed to cover the entire  range of paternal activities Nothing in this first command anticipates  much less helps the son to understand the contradictory command  that follows You may not be like your father And this command  too seems to brook no exceptions   All the sons efforts to differentiate between the commands and to  formulate distinctions end in failure and his bewilderment gives rise to  terror He wonders what he has done wrong and struggles to find  separate areas of application for the two commands He finds it diffi cult to see where he is at faultcertainly he has broken no law yet  known to himso he applies himself to discovering some new law that  will allow him to define his conduct as illegal   What conclusions must be drawn from this definition of the super ego Why did Freud again toy with the mimetic effects that he had  rejected at the Oedipal stager There seems only one possible answer  he had no intention of renouncing the mimetic effects resulting from  identification For he reverts to them when he takes up the concept of  the superego Yet the definition of the superego follows almost im mediately on the definition of the Oedipus complex previously quoted  a definition purged of the mimetic elements that had characterized  Freuds earlier definition in Group Psychology crnd the Analysis of the  Ego   It seems possible then to follow the evolution of Freuds thought  from Group Psychology in 1921 to The Ego and the Id in 1923 In the  earner work Freud believed it possible to reconcile the mimetic effect  with his main thesis the Oedipus complex that is why observations on  the mimetic phenomenon are sprinkled throughout this work But in  the very course of composition it seems Freud began to sense the  incompatibility of the two themes And this incompatibility quickly     becomes all too clear The mimetic process detaches desire from any  predetermined object whereas the Oedipus complex fixes desire on the  maternal object The mimetic concept eliminates all conscious knowl edge of patricideincest and even all desire for it as such the Freudian  proposition by contrast is based entirely on a consciousness of this  desire   Freud evidently decided to permit himself the luxurv of his Oedipus  complex When he had to choose between the mimetic concept and a  fullblown patricideincest drive he opted firmly for the latter This is  not to say that he renounced exploring the promising possibilities of  mimesis the admirable thing about Freud is his refusal ever to re nounce anything In suppressing the effects of mimesis he was simply  trying to prevent mimesis from subverting his own cherished version  of the Oedipus myth He wanted to get hold of the Oedipus com plex once and for all so as to be free to return to the mimesis question  Once he had the complex behind him he could take mimesis up where  he had left it before the burgeoning of the idea of the complex   In short Freud attempted initially to develop the Oedipus complex  on the basis of a desire that is both objectoriented cathectic and yet  originates in mimesiswhence comes the strange duality of the identifi cation with the father and the lubidinous attraction for the mother in  the first and even the second version of the complex The failure of  this attempt at compromise compelled Freud to base his complex on a  purely cathectic desire and to reserve the mimetic effect for another  psychic structure the superego   The duality of Freuds position stems from his effort to separate two  poles of his thinking on desire cathectic and Oedipal at one extreme  mimetic at the other But any attempt to sever the link between the  two will end in failure as did the attempt at synthesis that preceded it   It is hopeless to attempt to isolate the three elements of mimetic  desire identification choice of object and rivalry That Freuds  thought was never free of the influence of mimetic preoccupations can  be proved by the irresistible conjunction of these three elements  whenever any one of them appears the other two are sure to follow It  was only with the greatest effort and at the expense of much of his  credibility that Freud managed to rid his Oedipus complex of all traces  of mimesis Conversely in the case of the superego where in principle  nothing interferes with the sons paternal identification we witness  once again an upsurge of rivalry for the mother object When the  superego proclaims You may not be like this your father    some  things are his prerogative Freud is clearly referring to the mother  That is why he adds This double aspect of the ego ideal derives from  the fact that the ego ideal had the task of repressing the Oedipus     Freud and the Oedipus Complex 181   complex indeed it is to that revolutionary event that it owes its exis tence7   This superego simultaneously repressing and repressed which only  exists thanks to that revolutionary event poses a formidable prob lem It knows too much even in a negative sense The truth is that the  reactivating of the fatheridentification which gives the superego its  meaning automatically reactivates the Oedipal triangle As I have re marked Freud cannot evoke one of the three elements of the mimetic  configuration without the other twos putting in an appearance The  reappearance of the Oedipal triangle was not in his program The  Oedipus complex the capital that served to launch the entire psycho analytic enterprise is supposed to be firmly locked away in the uncon scious deposited deep in the vaults of the psyche   This inopportune reappearance of the Oedipal triangle compelled  Freud to admit that the son might experience certain difficulties in  repressing his Oedipus complex In fact it is Freud himself who was  having trouble disposing of the mimetic triangle Haunted by the  mimetic rivalry he repeatedly sketched out triangular formations he  believed to represent his complex whereas in fact they depict a con stantly thwarted mimesisan interplay of model and obstacle that  lingers at the edge of his thought but that he never succeeds in articu lating fully   I limited myself to examining two or three passages whose compari son seems particularly revealing other passages could have been chosen  that would have suited my purposes equally well including some from  the socalled clinical cases In my chosen passages a term fundamental  to Freudian speculationambivalencereappears at frequent intervals  It seems to me that this term testifies to the existence of the mimetic  pattern in Freuds mind and to his inability to express correctly the  relationship among the three elements of the structure the model the  disciple and the object that is disputed by both because the models  desire has made the object desirable to the disciple The object repre sents a desire shared by both and such sharing leads not to harmony as  one might suppose but to bitter conflict   The term ambivalence appears toward the close of the two defini tions of the Oedipus complex previously quoted Here are the passages  again   His the boysi identification with the father takes on a hostile colouring  and becomes identical with the wish to replace the father in regard to  his mother as well Identification in fact is ambivalent from the very  first   i Ibid     182 Violence and the Sacred   His identification with his father takes on a hostile colouring and  changes into a wish to get rid of his father in order to take his place  writh his mother Henceforward his relation to his father is ambivalent  it seems as if the ambivalence inherent in the identification from the  beginning had become manifest   When we recall how the identification with the father is initially  presentedThis behavior has nothing to do with a passive or femi nine attitude towards his father   we seem to be dealing with a  unified relationship free of ambiguity Why then does Freud a few  lines later and seemingly as an afterthought attribute an underlying  ambiguity to this identification Simply because he now senses and his  intuition does not betray him that the positive feelings resulting from  the first identificationimitation admiration venerationare fated to  change into negative sentiments despair guilt resentment But Freud  does not realize why such things must happen He does not realize  because he cannot accept a concept of desire based on mimesis he  cannot openly acknowledge the model in the identification to be a  model of the desire itself and thus a powerful force of opposition   Whenever he encounters the effects inherent in mimetic desire and  finds himself struggling vainly to formulate its mechanism of rivalry  Freud takes refuge in the idea of ambivalence To label these effects as  ambivalent is to confine them to a solipsistic context a traditional  philosophic subject instead of identifying them as a fundamental trait  of all human relations the universal double bind of imitated desires If  we try to grasp these effects of mimetic desire as individual pathology  or psychology they become utterly incomprehensible in conse quence we ascribe them to physical causes Freud himself conveys  this impression and managed to persuade himself that in using the term  ambivalence he had made a daring plunge into the dark regions where  the psychic and the somatic meet In reality he was simply refusing to  decipher a perfectly decipherable message And because the physical  is by nature mute no rebuttal is possible Today everyone imagines  himself tuned in to the physical able to decode the bodys messages  after the example of Freud Yet in all Freuds work there is not a single  example of ambivalence that does not have its origins in the obstacle model   To attribute the conflict to the body is to give up on the logic of  mimetic desire that can account most intelligibly and economically for  all phenomena With Freud the physical aspect of the subject the  corporeal regions of the psyche are endowed with a more or less or ganic propensity to run head on into the obstacle of the modeldesire  Ambivalence becomes the main virtue of physicality insofar as it  nourishes the psyche it becomes the virtus dormitiva of modern     Freud and the Oedipus Complex 183   scholasticism in the face of desire Thanks to this idea and a number of  others psychoanalysis has been able to grant a reprieveeven appar endy to grant new lifeto the myth of the individual by reasserting  the claims of physicality Yet this is the very myth it should be trying  to demolish   Freuds use of the term ambivalence reveals a genuine if very lim ited recognition of mimetic desirewhich is more than can be said for  many of his followers The interesting question is how Freud managed  repeatedly to misconstrue such a simple mechanism In a sense its very  simplicity served to camouflage its presence but there is something  else at work here as well   That something else is not difficult to identify we have encountered  it at every turn in the course of our inquiry It is of course the hard  core of the Oedipus complex that brief interval of consciousness when  the patricideincest desire is felt to become a formal expression of the  childs intentions It is clear that this Freudian view makes Freuds full  discovery of mimetic desire impossible To persuade himself that the  patricideincest desire actually exists Freud was obliged to disregard  the model insofar as it is responsible for awakening the desire and  designating the object Freud was forced to perpetuate a traditional  retrogressive concept of the desire The drift of his thought in the  direction of mimesis was perpetually checked by his strange loyalty to  the patricideincest motif   As an interpretative tool the concept of mimetic rivalry is far more  serviceable than the Freudian complex By eliminating the conscious  patricideincest desire it does away with the cumbersome necessity of  the desires subsequent repression In fact it does away with the un conscious The concept explains the Oedipus myth and does so with an  economy and precision lacking in the Freudian approach Why then  we may well ask did Freud renounce the superior utility of mimetic  desire to lavish his attention on the poor substitute of patricideincest   Even if I am mistakeneven if I am blind to the virtues of the  Oedipus myth as a universal model for the human psychestill my  question remains valid It seems unlikely that Freud ever formally  rejected the interpretation I am proposing here as a substitute for his  complex in all likelihood it never came to his attention Had it done  so Freud would surely have taken it under consideration if only to  reject it y reading brings together a number of clues that seem to  play little part in Freuds texts the obstacle of the patricideincest  motif once removed we can bring together elements that remain dis connected in Freuds own work Freud was dazzled bv what he took to  be his crucial discovery Loyalty to this disco very kept him from  forging ahead on the path of mimesis Had he done so he would have     184 Violence and the Sacred   come to realize the mythic nature of the patricideincest motif as it  appears in the Oedipus myth and in psychoanalysis as well   The whole of psychoanalysis seems to be summed up in the patricide incest theme It is this theme that has won psychoanalysis its glory and  its notoriety that has provoked the incomprehension hostility and  extraordinary devotion we have come to associate with the discipline  It is this theme that is invariably invoked whenever any rebellious spirit  dares to cast doubt on the efficacy of psychoanalytic doctrine   Freuds intimations of mimetic desire never crystallized into a the ory The founder of psychoanalysis brooded over the same themes  throughout his lifetime and his unending struggle to reorganize the  elements of desire never produced truly satisfactory results because he  refused to abandon his object desire his cathectic viewpoint The  various structures and examples of Freudianism theoretical concepts  such as the castration complex the Oedipus complex the superego the  unconscious repression ambivalenceall these are nothing more than  defensive positions in his eternal battle to resolve the problem of de sire   Freudian analysis should not be regarded as a fully articulated sys tem but as a series of experiments dealing almost invariably with the  same subject The superego for instance is only a recasting of the  Oedipus complex the more 1 examine the origins of the two concepts  the more convinced I become that their differences are purely illusory   Freud at his best is no more Freudian than Marx at his best is  Marxist Nevertheless uncomprehending critics did on occasion  provoke him to adopt a dogmatic line of argument that his followers  blindly accepted and his opponents as blindly rejected therefore mak ing it difficult for any of us to approach these texts with an open  mind   PostFreudian psychoanalysis has clearly perceived what must be  done to systematize Freudianismor rather to sever it from its living  roots To assure the autonomy of desire it is only necessary to erase the  last traces of mimesis from the Oedipus complex Thus the identifica tion with the father must be dropped Freud had already pointed the  wray after all in The Ego and the Id Inversely to establish the su premacy of the superego on a firm basis one need only eliminate all  those elements that tend to implicate the object and the subject of  rivalry in its definition In short the postFreudian psychoanalyst reas serts a system an order of things based on common sense such as  only Freud himself ever challenged In the case of the Oedipus com plex the father becomes a disgraced rival thus there is no question of  his being a venerated model Reciprocally in the case of the superego  the father is the venerated model with no trace of the disgraced rival     Freud and the Oedipus Complex 185   about him Ambivalence it would appear is good for patients but of  no use to psychoanalysts   We are presented therefore with a rivalry devoid of preliminary  identification the Oedipus complex followed by an identification  without subsequent rivalry the superego In one of his earliest arti cles Aggression in Psychoanalysis Jacques Lacan noted the be wildering character of this sequence The structural effect of the  identification with the rival does not follow naturally except perhaps  in mythic thinking8 But let us leave the myth aside we will pres ently see that it can take care of itself Moreover the effect noted by  Lacan makes perfect sense in terms of the mimetic nature of desire  which Lacan too failed to discover forced as he was by his linguistic  fetishism to reinforce the more rigid and structural aspects of Freud ian thinking   The interest of Freudian analysis does not lie in its results in its  pretentious accumulation of psychic agencies nor does it lie in the  spectacle of Freudian apprentices clambering up and down the pre carious scaffolding of Freudian doctrine with an agility as remarkable  as it is futile It lies paradoxically enough in the ultimate inadequacies  of the whole system Freud never succeeded in establishing the precise  relationship of the model the disciple and their common object al though he never entirely abandoned the effort Whenever he at tempted to manipulate any two of the terms the third raised its head  like a mocking jackinthebox which his disciples made haste to cram  back in its box in the belief that they were doing something useful In  fact it is hard to imagine a more effective method of castrating the  Master    Q  4 SINCE FREUDS TIME it has often been disputed  whether the Oedipus complex is a phenomenon exclusive to the Occi dental world or whether it is also to be found in primitive societies  Malinowskis The Father in Primitive Society has been cited in this  context   Malinowski begins by asserting that the Trobrianders are happier  than Occidentals Yet these savages while free of the conflicts and  tensions of civilization are heset by conflicts and tensions of their own  In Trobriander society the maternal uncle performs some of the func tions that in our society are allotted to the father It is from the uncle  rather than the father that the children inherit their worldly goods it  is the uncle who is responsible for their tribal education We should  not be surprised therefore to observe that conflicts and tensions arise  between children and uncle rather than between children and father   8 Jacques Lacan Ecrits Paris 1966 p 117     186 Violence and the Sacred   and that in time of stress the father functions as a source of comfort  and protection as an indulgent and welldisposed comrade9   Malinowski himself presents his observations in the context of a  dialogue with Freud The impression thev leave is unclear The author  begins by contradicting Freuds assertion that the Oedipus complex is  universal His reflections on the status of the uncle follow seeming to  cast a more favorable light on psychoanalytic theory Malinowski no  longer appears to be questioning Freud but rather to be filling out his  theories The uncles position in Trobriander society is analogous to  the fathers position in Western society and in this sense the Oedipus  complex could be said to partake of a certain universality7   Psychoanalysts have accorded Malinowskis work a warm reception  They see it as a refutation of the anthropologists who have accused  psychoanalysis of parochialism but they fail to notice that Malinowski  whose Freudianism is rather superficial refers only to an explicit and  fully conscious conflict between children and their Trobriander  uncles There is nothing here on the psychoanalytic level that allows  us to declare these conflicts to be rooted in an unconscious drama  whose protagonist is the uncle himself It is scarcely likely that this  omission would have gone unnoticed had the work been unfavorable  to psychoanalysis   Some of Malinowskis observations seem vital to the present discus sion They address themselves directly to relationships that are of par ticular interest to us and that are the only real aspect of the Oedipus  complex Without fully appreciating the significance of his own re marks Malinowski demonstrates that primitive societies or at any  rate Trobriander society employ methods for combating mimetic  rivalry and the double bind that are totally foreign to our own culture  The essential factor here is not the fathers indulgence or the uncles  severity not the displacement of authority from one masculine image  to another rather it is the cleavage made between father and son the  fact that the father and paternal culture in general does not serve as a  model   Father and son do not belong to the same lineage The father never  commands the son Do as 1 do   The child    learns that the place where his kada mothers brother  resides is also his the childs own village that there he has his property  and his other rights of citizenship that there are his future prospects  there reside his natural allies and associates He may even be taunted in  the village of his birth with being an outsider    Thus the life of a  Trobriander runs under a twofold influencea duality which must not  be imagined only as a mere surface play of custom It enters deeply into   9 Malinowski The Father in Primitive Society pp 1718     Freud and the Oedipus Complex 181   the existence of individual men it produces strange complications of  usage it creates frequent tensions and difficulties   10   The sons live with a mantheir fatherwho does not incorporate  their ideal in the Freudian sense of the ideal ego or the superego  Such an ideal is indeed provided by the culture in the form of the  closest adult relative in the maternal line but the children do not live  with this model To begin with the maternal uncle intervenes rather  late in the childrens1 existence and even then his presence is only  intermittent for he usually lives in another village Moreover and most  importantly there is a very strict taboo denying him any contact with  his sister the mother of the children So in Freudian terms as well as in  those of the double bind the displacement toward the uncle is illusory  The avuncular Oedipus complex then turns out to be little more than  a whimsy In fact the tensions that exist between uncle and nephew  are the morS explicit because the child is not torn by contradictory  feelings for him the obstacle cannot become the model nor the model  the obstacle The mimesis is channeled in such a way that desire will  not take its own obstacle as an object   The study of other primitive systems would probably reveal that in  those instances where the cultural model is incarnated in a specific  individual the models sphere of activity never impinges on that of the  disciple so as to produce a convergence of their two desires In fact  the two spheres of activity only touch at those points and at those  predetermined moments that are necessary to ensure the disciples ini tiation into the culture   Malinowskis observations give us reason to believe that primitive  societies cope with the double bind more effectively than does West ern society Indeed howr can we define Western society in terms rele vant to the Trobrianders In our society ever since the time of the  ancient patriarchs a plurality of functions which among the Trobri anders are divided between father and uncle have been assigned to one  man alone Our patriarchal system is less differentiated than the Tro briander system and even though it can and must appear to us from  the point of view of the modern family as the extreme of arbitrary  structuralization from the perspective of primitive societies it would  be regarded as the opposite   Surely we should abandon the use of the Oedipus complex a  seemingly inexhaustible source of confusion We could then bring into  conjunction with conflictual mimesis those entirely genuine phenom ena that psychoanalysis has explained by its Oedipus complex These  phenomena would gain in coherence moreover it would become pos  10 Ibid pp 1819     188 Violence and the Sacred   sible to incorporate them into a diachronic plan to situate historically  not only the phenomena themselves but also the theories that have  been proposed to explain thembeginning of course with psycho analysis itself   A theoretical concept such as the Oedipus complex can only be  applied to a society in which reciprocal mimesis has already been estab lished and the modelobstacle mechanism set in motion but its violent  effects not yet generally felt In addition this mechanism must usually  be triggered by the father If the double bind originates with the  father the mimetic attraction will preserve its paternal coloring as long  as the victim lives With the individual as with groups mimetic attrac tion always becomes more and more acute it always tends to repro duce its initial forms in other terms it always seeks new modelsand  new obstaclesthat resemble the original one If this original model is  the father the subject will choose models that resemble him   In Western society the father had already become the model by the  patriarchal era In order for the double bind to operate he had also to  become the obstacle And the father can onlv become an obstacle  wrhen the diminution of his paternal authority has brought him into a  direct confrontation with his son obliging him to occupy the same  sphere The Oedipus complex appears most plausible in a society in  which the fathers authority has been greatly weakened but not com pletely destroyed that is in Western society during the course of  recent centuries Here the father has functioned as the original model  and the original obstacle in a world where the dissolution of differ ences encourages the proliferation of the double bind   This state of affairs requires an explanation If the history of modern  society is marked by the dissolution of differences that clearly has  something to do with the sacrificial crisis to which we have repeatedly  referred Indeed the phrase modern world seems almost like a  synonym for sacrificial crisis It should be noted however that the  modern world manages to retain its balance precarious though it may  be and the methods it employs to do so though extreme are not so  extreme as to destroy the fabric of the society As my previous chap ters indicated primitive societies are unable to withstand such pres sures violence would quickly get out of hand and trigger the mech anism of generative unanimity thus restoring a social system based on  multiple and sharply pronounced differences In the modern Western  world nothing of this kind takes place The wearing away of differ ences proceeds at a slow7 but steady pace and the results are absorbed  more or less gracefully by a community that is slowly but steadily  coming to encompass the entire globe   It is not law in any conceivable form that is responsible for the     Freud and the Oedipus Complex 189   tensions and alienation besetting modern man rather it is the increas ing lack of law The perpetual denunciation of the law arises from a  typically modern sense of resentmenta feedback of desire that pur ports to be directed against the law but one that is actually aimed at the  modelobstacle whose dominant position the subject stubbornly refuses  to acknowledge The more frenzied the mimetic process becomes  caught up in the confusion of constantly changing forms the more  unwilling men are to recognize that they have made an obstacle of the  model and a model of the obstacle Here we encounter a true uncon scious and one that can obviously assume many forms   Freud is of little use as a guide over this terrain So for that matter  is Nietzsche who reserves his resentment for the weak while trying  vainly to establish a distinction between this resentment and a truly  spontaneous desire a will to power that he can claim as wholly his  own but that is in reality nothing more than the ultimate expression of  cumulative resentment No our best guide is perhaps Kafka one of the  few to perceive that the absence of law is in fact identical with law run  wild and that this identity constitutes the chief burden of mankind  Once more our best guide turns out to be one of those writers of  fiction whose insights have been studiously ignored by psychological  researchers When the father is no longer an overbearing patriarch the  son looks everywhere for the lawand finds no lawgiver   If the patriarchal system when compared to primitive systems  seems to represent a lesser degree of structuralization then Western  civilization since the decline of the patriarchal system can be said to  have been governed by a principle of decreasing structuralization or  destructralization during the whole of its historical coursea ten dency that can almost be seen as an ultimate aim A dynamic force  seems to be drawing first Western society then the rest of the world  toward a state of relative indifferentiation never before known on  earth a strange kind of nonculture or anticulture we call modern   The advent of psychoanalysis has been historically determined by  the advent of the modern Most of the phenomena associated with  the Oedipus complex reveal a true unity and intelligibility when seen  in the light of the mimetic processand this remains true even if the  main body of belief is purely mythical The Oedipus complex might  seem to be a satisfactory theory during the early stages of mimetic  propagation in a historical situation characterized by the limited sur vival at least for a while of family structures derived from the patri archal system We can witness here the same process of disintegration  that takes place in primitive societies during the sacrificial crisis but in  this case the process is gradual kept more or less in rein with no  catastrophic outbursts of violence and no resolution of any kind taking     190 Violence and the Sacred   place The astonishing flexibility of the modern along with its ex traordinary functionalism is here on view Equally visible are the ever increasing tensions that beset modern times   The Oedipus complex is a Western and modern phenomenon as are  the relative neutralization and sterilization of a mimetic desire that  though in the process of freeing itself is still oriented toward the  father and therefore inclined toward certain forms of order and stabil ity Psychoanalysis at this particular moment in history seems at once  to announce and to prepare the way for something it cannot itself  describe an advanced stage of indifferentiation or decoding which  involves the complete effacement of the paternal function   Like all forms of mythical thought psychoanalysis is a closed system  that can never be refuted If there is no conflict between father and  son it is because the unconscious aspect of the complex has come into  play and if there is a conflict that too is a result of the complex In  short the complex is bound to appear and if it does not that circum stance only confirms its existence   Not only can the teachings of psychoanalysis always be confirmed  but they seem increasingly to the point as mimesis spreads and grows  more acute as destructuralization becomes more widespread and the  double bind proliferates The Oedipus complex waxes as the father  wanes It has become routine to ascribe all sorts of psychic disorders to  an Oedipus whose Laius remains obstinately out of sight The need to  trace the complex to some fleshandblood father or uncle or any one  individual at all is now said to be illusory as indeed it is Psychoanaly sis vanquishes all challengers It is everywhereand nowhere It finally  dissolves into the banality of multisided familial and nonfamilial rival ries in a more and more competitive world   4 IF THE OEDIPUS COMPLEX constitutes an erroneous  reading of the double bind then we can say that those desires that the  world at large and the father in particular regard as emanating from  the sons own patricideincest drive actually derive from the father  himself in his role as model   The Freudian myth is still so influential today even among skeptics  that the foregoing statement may well seem like sheer perversity I feel  constrained therefore to seek support from a reputable author whose  authority in these matters is generally acknowledged Sophocles We  could of course turn once more to Oedipus the King but that play  has been used so often and for so many purposes that its value as an  example has worn thin Let us rather consider a less familiar play The  Women of Trachis   In the last episode Heracles the protagonist has put on his poisoned     Freud and the Oedipus Complex 191   tunic and lies writhing in agony on the ground His son Hyllos stands  by respectfully awaiting his fathers last orders Heracles orders his  son to light a great fire and place him still living on the pyre thus  Heracles will be free of his pain Hyllos cries out in protest his father  is making a patricide of him Heracles insists in such a manner as to  make himself responsible for the act responsible for perpetrating a  ruthless double bind   Heracles Do as I say for this must be done Or else cease to call your self my son   Hyllos Oh father what are you asking of me To be your murderer to  assume the guilt of your death   What follows is even more extraordinary Heracles has a second  favor less important than the first to ask of his sonand at this point  the play takes on a distinctly comic air at any rate for modern ears  attuned to Freudian motifs Because his death leaves his young wife  lole acquired in the course of the last labor without a protector  Heracles makes a proposal to his son   Heracles When I am dead if you wish to show your piety and stand  by the vows made to your father make her lole your wife Do not  deny me this She has slept at my side and it is my wish that no one  but you possess her Go take her to your bed What good is it if you  carry out my greater commands and neglect the lesser ones like this   Hyllos Ah it is wrong to lose ones temper at a sick man yet how hard  it is to put up with him when he has such ideas   After this exchange not unworthy of a postFreudian Moliere the  dialogue continues to gain in interest Hyllos offers as his reason for  refusing lole the role she has playedthough only as passive spectator  in the family tragedy that is now drawing to a close In fact it is the  true relationship between the fathers desire and the sons desire that is  being challenged an identification that appears as impious rebellion to  the world at large although it is in fact an absolute submission to the  paternal command to the insidious and imperious suggestion by the  paternal model that the son desire what the father desires   Hyllos Father have pity on me 1 am the most wretched of men  Heracles Because you refuse to obey your father  Hyllos But when you preach impiety to your son  Heracles There can be no impiety in your pleasing me  Hyllos Then these are your final orders  Heracles They are and the gods are my witnesses     192 Violence and the Sacred   Hyllos Then I will obey For the gods know it is your will and surely  a son does no wrong in obeying his father   Heracles Then all is well      As we can see the ancient drama is more knowledgeable in the ways  of fathers and sons than is modern psychoanalytic theory It provides  modern theorists with a lesson in humility For Sophocles speaking  over the span of twentyfive centuries can help us to cast off that most  burdensome of all mythologies the myth of the Oedipus complex11   11 This is perhaps the place to call attention to the signal perceptiveness of other  purely literary works that touch upon the same subject On the question of  paternal incitement to patricide Calderons remarkable La Vida es meno merits  special attention See also Cesareo Banderas highly original study Mimesis conflic tiva Madrid Gredos 1975 This study reveals Calderon as an author who goes  one step beyond Freud in dealing with the question of desire and the obstacle that  masquerades as the law     8fc Chapter Eight   Totem and Taboo and the  Incest Prohibition   CftSdri CONTEMPORARY CRITICISM is almost unanimous in       finding unacceptable the theories set forth in Totem and   Taboo Freud assumes at the outset the very propositions his book is  supposed to explore Darwins primal horde is a caricature of the  family and the sexual monopoly of the dominant male coincides with  future prohibitions regarding incest As LeviStrauss remarks in The  Elementary Structures of Kinship we have here ua vicious circle de riving the social state from events which presuppose it1   This objection has validity if one considers the work only in its  broad outlines Still there are aspects of Totem and Taboo that elude  categorization And although one might assume that the theory of  collective murder for example presented in the work has been amply  clarified by the critics such is not the case To be sure the subject of  collective murder invariably crops up in connection with the book  indeed it seems to constitute the main attraction of this work this  bizarre edifice through which we are guided by ghb commentators  who seem one and all to have the same story to tell Totem and  Taboo they assure us is an example of the aberrations to which genius  is prone These commentators see the work either as an anomaly or as  an unwitting farcesomething like the novels of Victor Hugos old  age   A reexamination of the work in question confirms our uneasiness  The murder motif is conspicuous but it serves no apparent purpose If  the subject of the book is the genesis of sexual prohibitions then this  motif hinders Freuds argument rather than helps it Without the mur der motif we could pass easily from the sexual privations inflicted on  the young bv a primordial father to the strictly cultural prohibitions  But the murder breaks the circuit and while Freud tries dutifully to   1 Claude LeviStrauss The Elementary Structures of Kinship trans James  Harle Bell John Richard von Sturmer and Rodney Needham Boston 1969  p 491   193     194 Violence and the Sacred   restore the connection he does so without conviction Ultimately his  ideas on the subject of sexual prohibitions are both more confused and  less simplistic than has been generally acknowledged   Far from serving to put things in order the murder motif seems  to throw everything into disarray The theory that attributes the  prohibitions to the fathers sexual monopoly is not Freuds invention  as Freud himself makes plain   Atkinson 1903 seems to have been the first to realize that the practical  consequence of the conditions obtaining in Darwins primal horde might  be exogamy for the young males Each of them might after being driven  out establish a similar horde in which the same prohibition upon sexual  intercourse would rule owing to its leaders jealousy In course of time  this would produce what grew into a conscious law No sexual rela tions between those who share a common home After the establish ment of totemism this regulation would assume another form and would  run No sexual relations within the totem2   The concept of collective murder however undoubtedly originates  with Freud Its apparent superfluousness and incongruity has prompted  critics to wonder why Freud included it at all and French psycho analysts have responded to the question in their customary fashion by  attributing the concept to the authors unconscious In Totem and  Taboo they inform us Freud treats his readers to a particularly spec tacular revelation of his own repressed desires And although this is the  sort of response we have learned to expect from Freuds followers it is  slightly disconcerting to find it applied to the master himself Of all  Freuds works Totem and Taboo is the only one thus singled out for  therapeutic treatment the only one for which such a treatment is not  only permitted but apparently encouraged   Freudians are generally prompt to pay obeisance to the least utter ance of their oracle and to denounce in violent terms the most tenta tive questioning of his conclusions3 A summary condemnation of  Totem and Taboo must make a strong impression on the lay observer  who can only conclude that this particular work must have been very  badly botched indeed   Modern ethnologists although generally kinder to amateurs than are  their colleagues in the field of psychoanalysis have shown themselves  equally severe toward Totem and Taboo The work was published in  1913 when ethnology was still a fledgling science The theories drawn  on by FreudFrazers and in particular Robertson Smithshave long   2Freud Standard Edition vol 13 Totem and Taboo p 126  3 The author has in mind primarily the modern French school of Freudian   psychoanalysisTrans     Totem and Taboo and the Incest Prohibition 195   been superseded The concept of totemism is virtually obsolete and  above all Freuds main thesis is patently false   In short there are so many excellentreasons for condemning Totem  and Taboo that the work has never received serious critical examina tion Yet if it is true that Freud lost his head in the writing of this  essay surely it is worthwhile to determine how why and to what  extent he went astray The greater ones esteem for Freuds genius the  more valid such an inquiry appears The accusations leveled at Totem  and Taboo must cast doubt on Freuds other theories as wellat any  rate until the Freudians succeed in localizing the difficulty and cor recting it But this is precisely what certain neoFreudians failindeed  refuseto undertake The antireferential prejudice is so strong that it  has become second nature   True scientific inquiry is always open to disquieting speculations to  theories that flatly contradict the beliefs of the moment or challenge  their most cherished conventions But perhaps it is misleading to speak  of disquieting theories we should rather refer to theories of vary ing degrees of credibility Before accusing Freud of succumbing to his  illusionsas if he were a mere fictionmakera Shakespeare or a  Sophocles or a Euripideslet us at least give him a hearing It is  strange that the very people who claim to represent the living spirit of  psychoanalysis dismiss Freud the most flippantly   Everyone seems intent on covering Totem and Taboo with obloquy  and condemning it to oblivion My own attitude toward the book is  obviously quite different Freuds concept of collective murder and the  arguments he uses to present it are too close to the themes of my own  work for me to pass over the book in silence   It is important to bear in mind that an ethnological theory can be  justly criticized even conclusively refuted without invalidating the  evidence collected in its defence Although totemism has been shown  to be only one facet of a far broader form of activitythat of classifi cationit does not necessarily follow that the religious phenomena  that were previously explained by totemism are now to be considered  null and void These phenomena must simply be considered in a  broader context our concern should now be directed to the relation ship between religion and the overall question of classification That  distinctions should exist or that these distinctions should remain stable  cannot be taken for granted from the standpoint of primitive societies  Totemism may indeed be illusory but this illusion served to focus  attention on the enigma of religious belief   Freud was fully aware of the risks involved in selecting totemism as  the rallying point for his arguments Far from placing a blind trust in  the concept he scrutinized his results with a critical eye and concluded     196 Violence and the Sacred   that everything connected with totemism seems to be puzzling4 He  found none of the proposed solutions to his liking including the one he  qualified as nominalism which when carried to its logical conclu sions has led to the contemporary refutation of the entire concept  The nominalist theories I have so far discussed    might perhaps  explain the fact that primitive peoples adopt animal names for their  clans but they could never explain the importance that has become at tached to this nomenclaturenamely the totemic system5   What is important here is not the reference to the totem or to any  other system but the religious presence which must not be casually  and fraudulently dismissed as something that goes without saying It  is no part of the role of science to deprive the spirit of the justifiable  sense of wonderment that is occasioned by certain human acts Freud  rejected all those too rational points of view that fail to take into  account the affective side of things   Freuds attention was caught by the same kinds of actsin some  instances actually by the identical actsthat I have presented in the  preceding chapters He observed that in primitive religion extreme  opposites coincide good and evil sadness and joy accepted and for bidden practices The festival for example is a permitted or rather  an obligatory excess a solemn breach of a prohibition6 The coinci dence of the permitted and the prohibited brings to mind the sacrificial  process when the deed is done the slaughtered animal is lamented  and bewailed     This is hardly surprising because sacrifice and  festival are one and the same rite There is no gathering of a clan  without an animal sacrifice norand this now becomes significant  any slaughter of an animal except on these ceremonial occasions7   The same mingling of the permitted and the prohibited is found in  the treatment of certain animals even when the sacrificial element is  not formally present A totem animal that is found dead is mourned  and buried like a dead kinsman If it is necessary to kill a totem animal  this is done according to a prescribed ritual of apologies and cere monies of expiation8   Freud discerns this strange duality of sacrificial custom in all aspects  of primitive religion The rite is invariably presented in the form of a  murder a transgression both culpable and obligatory whose virtue lies  ultimately in its very impiety   Robertson Smith clearly perceived the unifying factors in those   4 Freud Totem md Taboo p 108  5 Ibid p 111  8 Ibid p 140  7 Ibid p 135  8 Ibid p 104     Totem and Taboo and the Incest Prohibition 191   practices that broadly speaking correspond to our sacrificial rites  and that he chose to group under the heading totemism The term  had a great vogue among ethnologists who shared a particular body of  knowledge as well as certain intellectual attitudes that no longer seem  valid But if we do not always agree with their concepts we approve  of their quest to fathom the hidden meaning of primitive religions and  to establish their essential unity   It is this quest for unity that led Robertson Smith and later Freud  to propose totemism as the origin of all religious manifestations These  socalled totemic beliefs serve to direct our attention to some extra ordinary manifestations of religious belief customs at once paradoxical  and enigmatic that seem to demand a full interpretation and that are  therefore the most likely to lead us toward the truth It was in the  aspects of totemism that dealt specifically with religion that Freud  found far more conspicuously than elsewhere that coincidence of  opposites that serves to define the overall process of religion Religious  totemism is connected with the operation in which violence caught up  in its own paroxysm produces an inversion by means of an actual act  of collective murder Freud astutely surmised the necessity for this act  but because the mechanism of the surrogate victim eluded him he  failed to grasp its modus operandi   This mechanism provides the only feasible explanation of how a  sacrificial murder originally regarded as a crime can literally be trans formed into an act of piety There seems to be a very close connection  if not an essential similarity between this transformation and the clans  individual attitudes toward their totems In many instances the pursuit  of the totem its slaughter and devouring are expressly restricted to  those solemn festivals that seem to involve a somewhat equivocal inver sion of customfor during those festivals the entire clan is obliged to  commit all the acts forbidden throughout the rest of the year   The urge to duplicate the operation of the surrogate victim is even  more apparent in the case of totemic belief than in the classic sacri fice Clearly the truth we are seeking is close at hand and although  Freud failed to grasp it he was surelv on the right track when he  concentrated his attention on totemism His intuition did not play him  false in suggesting a connection between the enigmas of religion and an  actual act of murder But for want of a mechanism that would make  this connection Freud was unable to translate his discovery into any  kind of plausible formulation He never advanced beyond the idea of a  single act of murder in principle at least committed in prehistoric  timesan idea that if taken literally lends a note of fantasy to his  theory   Before we assert that Freud dreamed of murdering his own father or     198 Violence and the Sacred   wrote his book under dictation from his unconscious it might be  worth while to review the arguments so forcefully advanced in Totem  and Taboo Freud insists as I have also done on the need for unani mous participation in the rites If these rites were not performed by  the entire group acting in unison they would be nothing more than  criminal acts of destructive intent Freud fails to perceive the func tional dimension of unanimity but he is nonetheless aware that the  sanctity of the proceedings depends on their indivisibility In many  cultures moreover the mananimal or totemic monster assumes the  guise of judge mentor and ancestor without relinquishing his role as  victim slaughtered by his fellows and peers the first being cut down  by a community which while mythic is nonetheless a double of real  society   We have here a series of clues well worth pursuing and it is a sad  commentary on our present intellectual scene that we cannot draw the  logical conclusion from themnamely a theory of collective murder  without provoking an automatic rejection from critics who like to  think of themselves as the practitioners of impartial scientific inquiry   A careful comparison of sacrificial rites and totemic beliefs will  bring out certain dominant strains that have a direct bearing on the  subject of collective murder All the signs seem to suggest that the  gods along with the community itself owe their origin to internal and  unanimous violence and to a victim who is a member of the com munity   A life Freud quotes Robertson Smith which no single tribesman is  allowed to invade and which can be sacrificed only by the consent and  common action of the kin stands on the same footing with the life of  the fellowtribesmen The rule that every participant at the sacrificial  meal must eat a share of the flesh of the victim has the same meaning as  the provision that the execution of a guilty tribesman must be carried  out by the tribe as a whole In other words the sacrificial animal was  treated as a member of the tribe the sacrificing community the god and  the sacrificial animal were of the same blood and members of the same  clan Freuds italics9   As we can see the problematic aspects of the totemic theory7 do not  affect Freuds basic conclusions Indeed totemism plays no part here  The dynamism of Totem and Taboo is directed toward a general  theory of sacrifice Robertson Smith had already pointed the way but  Freud managed to push the inquiry furtherlargely because he was  indifferent to the theoretical debates then raging among anthropolo gists The enormous mass of collaborative information obviously de   Ibid p 133     Totem and Taboo and the Incest Prohibition 199   manded a single allembracing explanation a general theory that was  first and foremost related to the subject of sacrifice Robertson Smith  explains that sacrifice at the altar was the essential feature in the ritual  of ancient religions It plays the same part in all religions so that its  origin must be traced back to very general causes operating every where in the same manner10   Freuds archetypal sacrificial rite was practiced by a tribe of the  Sinai desert It is described by St Nilus in the fourth century and  cited by Robertson Smith who himself found it highly significant   The victim of the sacrifice a camel Freud quoting Robertson Smith is  bound upon a rude altar of stones piled together and when the leader  of the band has thrice led the worshippers round the altar in a solemn  procession accompanied with chants he inflicts the first wound    and  in all haste drinks the blood that gushes forth Forthwith the whole  company fall on the victim with their swords hacking off pieces of the  quivering flesh and devouring them raw with such wild haste that in the  short interval between the rise of the day star to which the sacrifice  was offered    and the disappearance of its rays before the rising sun  the entire camel body bones skin blood and entrails is wholly de voured11   In my opinion the socalled totemic survivals that Robertson Smith  thought he had detected in the sacrifice can be attributed here as  elsewhere to an incomplete grasp of the part played by the surrogate  victim And Freuds interest in these totemic survivals sprang from  their relationship to his own concept of collective murder Given the  Sinai sacrifice and the context in which it appears we can hardly blame  Freud from drawing the conclusions that he did in favor of his murder  theory Indeed is it really so obvious that Freud has abandoned the  principles of sound scientific practice in this work and that his whole  theory is based on a personal illusion that is psychological in origin   Faithful to his sources Freud limits his discussion almost exclusively  to the camel sacrifice One cannot help wondering what conclusions he  would have drawn had he taken into account similar practices over a  broad spectrum of independent cultures and submitted them to a  systematic comparison   In the Sinai sacrifice the camel is bound like a criminal and the  crowd is armed in the Dionysiac diasparagmos the victim is not bound  and the attackers have no weapons But twro constants remain the  crowd and the mad rush at the victim In some instances the victim is  encouraged to flee in others it is the participants who take flight In  every instance a mob murder is being reenacted although the scenes   10 Ibid  11 Ibid p 138     200 Violence and the Sacred   will vary in details These divergences should not be attributed to any  lapse of the ritual memory for the forms of collective murder differ  somewhat from one religion to another These differences though  slight are revealing for they evoke the realism of the model and  therefore discourage any attempt at purely formalist interpretation  These differences may have led to Freuds intuitive grasp of the situa tion even though they are only implicit in Totem and Taboo Indeed  it would have been impossible for Freud to consider them explicitly  for his theory of a single unique act of murder could neither accom modate nor explain them   An investigation into the nature of ritual resembles the sort of crim inal investigationno less valid for figuring so frequently in detective  fictionin which the solution of the mystery depends on a reenact ment of the crime No matter how clever the criminal no matter how  careful he may be to eliminate all traces of his presence he is unable to  extend his activities or repeat his past successes without laying down a  trail for his pursuers A seemingly insignificant detail passed over in  haste during the investigation of the first crime suddenly assumes  importance when it reappears in a slightly different guise In the same  way the successive proofs of an engraving allow us to discern patterns  or images that might well pass unnoticed when looking at one print in  isolation These differences constitute the ethnological equivalent of  Abschattungei those partiaj and always shifting perceptions that end  by establishing in terms of Husserlian phenomenology the stable and  indubitable element of a given object Once the law of their variations  has been apprehended the true object is correctly perceived Doubt is  then no longer possible the image remains indelible and any additional  information can only serve to consolidate and reinforce the now cor rectly identified object   Freud was not dreaming when he wrote Totem and Tabooy and he  assumed that the participants in sacrificial rites were not dreaming  either He could well have turned the rites into a dream this would  have been a possible line of defense for a formalist hard pressed by the  massed body of ethnological evidence But Freud did not take that  path Efforts have been made to prove him a formalist but in this case  at least he clearly perceived that any attempt to structure the dream  would be as futile as trying to structure the wind To declare sacrifice  a psychoanalytical fantasy would mean to lay aside an impressive body  of rigorously determined facts and observations that cry out for atten tion To dissolve these phenomena in dreams would be to deny the  rites any status as a social institution it would be to deny in effect  social unity itself     Totem and Taboo and the Incest Prohibition 201   The sacrificial act is too rich in concrete details to be only a simula tion of something that never actually occurred This assertion can be  made without contradicting my previous statement that the act is a  simulated performance designed to offer a substitute satisfaction Sacri fice takes the place of an act that nobody under normal cultural condi tions would dare or even desire to commit it is this aspect that Freud  wholly intent on the origins of sacrifice paradoxically failed to per ceive I qualify his failure as paradoxical because Totem and Taboo  lacks the one form of truth that appears though sometimes in distorted  form in the rest of his work Freud understands that sacrifice must be  traced back to an event of a quite different type from ritual itself yet  his intuition of origins because he did not follow it to the end caused  him to lose all sense of the function of the rite If sacrifice is accorded a  particular role in the rite this is because it was at one time something  else and because it retains that something else as a model In order to  reconcile function with origin and illuminate one by means of the  other Freud needed a tool that he failed to unearth the surrogate  victim   Nevertheless Freud made an important discovery He was the first  to maintain that all ritual practices all mythical implications have their  origins in an actual murder Freud was unable to exploit the boundless  implications of this proposition in fact he seemed unaware of the  truly vertiginous scope of this idea After his death his discovery was  summarily dismissed On the basis of secondary considerations Totem  and Taboo was written off as misleading or trivial This attitude can be  partially explained by the primary concern of Freuds followers to  consolidate the terrain conquered in the previous generation by Freud  and others they found their efforts severely challenged by the impli cations of Totem and Tabooy and so the work was thrust aside Freuds  momentous discovery was ignored as if it had never taken place   Far from handling his ethnological material like a clumsy amateur  Freud accomplished such a feat of systematization that he himself was  thrown off balance He was unable to formulate the hypothesis that  would do justice to his discovery and no one after him had the vision  to perceive that such a thing was even possible As an advance scout  Freud was all too daring and he found himself cut off from his own  line Freud has been called a victim of naive historicism the opposite is  true His general orientation and his methods of research freed him  from the fragmentary theories of origin and the antistructural associa tions that his contemporaries were prone to at the same time he stayed  clear of the opposite excesses which plague our own era His mind was  not closed to questions of origin nor did his failures awaken in him     202 Violence and the Sacred   any formalistic or antigenetic prejudices Freud swiftly perceived that  a firm grasp of synchronic totalities should result in new concepts  regarding the problem of origins concepts that had previously been  wholly unimaginable      K  ONE PASSAGE in Totem and Taboo is of particular  relevance to our inquiry Freud is discussing tragedy the tragic mode  as it is practiced all over the world   A company of individuals named and dressed alike surrounded a  single figure all hanging upon his words and deeds they were the  Chorus and the impersonator of the Hero He was originally the only  actor Later a second and third actor were added to play as counterpart  to the Hero and as characters split off from him but the character of the  Hero himself and his relation to the Chorus remained unaltered The  Hero of tragedy must suffer to this day that remains the essence of a  tragedy He has to bear the burden of what was known as tragic  guilt the basis of that guilt is not always easy to find for in the light  of our everyday life it is often no guilt at all As a rule it lay in rebellion  against some divine or human authority and the Chorus accompanied  the Hero with feelings of sympathy sought to hold him back to warn  him and to sober him and mourned over him when he had met with  what was felt as the merited punishment for his rash undertaking   But why had the Hero of tragedy to suffer And what was the mean ing of this tragic guilt 1 will cut the discussion short and give a quick  reply He had to suffer because he was the primal father the Hero of  the great primaeval tragedy which was being reenacted with a tenden tious twist and the tragic guilt was the guilt which he had to take on  himself in order to relieve the Chorus from theirs The scene upon the  stage was derived from the historical scene through a process of syste matic distortionone might even say as the product of a refined  hypocrisy In the remote reality it had actually been the members of the  Chorus who caused the Heros suffering now however they exhausted  themselves with sympathy and regret and it was the Hero himself who  was responsible for his own sufferings The crime which was thrown  on to his shoulders presumptuousness and rebelliousness against a great  authority was precisely the crime for which the members of the Chorus  the company of brothers were responsible Thus the tragic Hero be came though it might be against his will the redeemer of the Chorus12   In many respects this passage brings us closer to the concept of the  surrogate victim and the mythical structuration effected through it  than anything we have yet encountered in Freud Whole sentences  address themselves directly to our discussion The hero represents the   i2Ibid p 15556     Totem and Taboo and the Incest Prohibition 203   victim of a momentous and unexpected tragedy The tragic flaw at tributed to him is shared by the whole community but he alone must  bear its burden in order for the citv to be saved The hero thus assumes  the role of surrogate victim and in the very next paragraph Freud  alludes to the divine goat Dionysus Tragedy is thus defined as a  tendentious reenactment a mythic inversion of an event that actually  took place The scene upon the stage was derived from the historical  scene through a process of systematic distortionone might even say  as the product of a refined hypocrisy   Let me again call attention to what is undoubtedly an essential point  the collective violence directed against the solitary hero takes place  amidst that dissolution of distinctions I discussed earlier on The sons  of the primitive clan henceforth deprived of fathers have all become  enemy brothers Their resemblance is such that they do not possess  identities of their own We are left with a group of people all bearing  the same name identically dressed   I must take care however not to exaggerate the similarities between  Freuds theories and mv own The outlooks are ultimately different  and the difference bears on the genesis of difference According to  Freud the crowd of doubles stands in opposition to the absolute speci ficity of the hero The hero monopolizes innocence the mob monop olizes guilt The flaw attributed to the hero is not his but belongs  exclusively to the crowd The hero then is a victim pure and simple  charged with a crime he did not commit This concept of a simple one way projection of guilt seems to me inadequate Sophocles is wiser he  makes it clear and Dostoevsky was to do the same in The Brothers  Karamazov that the surrogate victim even when falsely accused may  be as guilty as the others For the traditional concept of the flaw  perpetuated as sin by theologically minded critics should be sub stituted that of violenceviolence in the past the future and above all  in the present violence equally shared by all After all Oedipus him self joined in the manhunt   The Freudian interpretation is thoroughly modern in its inversion of  the mythical content Thanks to the innocent victim with whose fate  one can easily identify it becomes possible to inculpate all the false  innocents This is precisely what Voltaire did in his Oedipe and what  the contemporary antitheater is striving to do in an atmosphere of ever increasing confusion and hysteria Our neighbors values are forever  being inverted to be used as a weapon against him In the final analysis  however each and every one of us is implicated in the effort to per petuate the structures of the myth whose very imbalance is designed to  stimulate our own aggression     204 Violence and the Sacred   Differences seem to have vanished only to reappear in inverted  form thereby perpetuating themselves It is these differences that  Heidegger refers to in relation to all of philosophy from Plato to  Nietzsche there the identical inversion occurs Philosophical concepts  serve to shield from sight the tragic conflict of human antagonisms  What Freud fails to perceive is that his own thought is influenced by  these same patterns and that even his interpretation of tragedy forms  part of the conflict and never succeeds in rising above it Moreover  the fixed nature of his reading corresponds precisely to the concept of  the single murder the murder of a true father a true hero which took  place at a single moment in time   The father figure is viewed as an oppressive monster during his life  but is transformed at death into a persecuted hero This operation is  effected by the mechanism of the sacreda mechanism Freud does not  uncover since he remains its victim In order to escape once and for all  from the domination of a certain kind of morality even meta morphosed into antimorality and a certain kind of metaphysic even  disguised as antimetaphysics we must renounce the gambit of good  and badeven in its inverted form We must acknowledge that  misapprehensions abound that violence is to be found everywhere and  that our partial understanding of violence by no means assures us vic tory over it The first step must be the heros reintegration into the  chorus his assumption of the chorus characteristic lack of characteris tics   It might be argued that Freud adheres more closely to the structure  of tragedy in his interpretation than I do and in one sense this is  correct In the tragic form inherited from myth and ritual the solitary  figure of the hero does indeed occupy the dominant central position  assigned him by Freud But that is only the beginning of the analysis  the matter must be pressed to its conclusion and the tragic form itself  along with the myth must be scrupulously dismantled Thus we will  learn that Sophocles while not following through to the end suc ceeded nonetheless in advancing farther than Freud along the path of  demystification Sophocles treats the essential elusiveness of the heroic  difference with relentless irony making it plain that the most con spicuous examples of individuality are put in doubt at the very  moment when they seem strongest and most validwhen in short  they are brought into violent opposition with another individual who  turns out to be almost identical   My approach incorporates all Freuds observations it also takes into  account those elements that escaped his but not Sophocles attention  Finally it deals with those elements that escaped even Sophocles  noticewith the configurations that give rise to myth and the differ    Totem and Taboo and the Incest Prohibition 205   ent perspectives including the psychoanalytic and the tragic from  which the subject can be viewed In short my innovation is to intro duce the mechanism of the surrogate victim   Freuds comments on Greek tragedy are undoubtedly the most pro found of all modern pronouncements on the subject And yet they  remain inconclusive   Strictly speaking it is not incorrect to qualify tragedy as tenden tious for the tragic element always springs up amidst the ruins of a  mythic framework However tragedy is the least tendentious of all  mythic forms As we have seen the aim of tragic inspiration is to  reestablish the reciprocity of reprisals to restore the symmetry of  violence in short to correct the tendentious aspect And Freuds ap proach takes the same line It reestablishes certain elements of reciproc ity but it does not go so far as tragedy itself goes The Freudian  approach is even more tendentious than tragedy is because Freud  snares the modern inclination to shift all blame for violence onto  others Thus Freud finds himself caught up in the giveandtake of  reprisals in the dual role of model and obstacle and in the vicious  cycle of mimetic desire That is the fallacy of the modern mind  which even when it is either too evolved or too knowledgeable to  claim immunity from all violent impulses invariably resorts to an ideal  of nonviolence completely foreign to the Greek mind as a covertly  violent criterion for all judgments and critical evaluations   Like all biased pronouncements Freuds strictures on Greek tragedy  ultimately turn against their author Ultimately it is Freud himself who  appears guilty of refined hypocrisy And the modern critic in his  concerted effort to undermine the structure of all religious moral and  cultural distinctions ultimately brings these distinctions crashing down  on his own head He sets himself up as the prophet of new insights and  new ideas as the sole possessor of an infallible system of analysisand  finds himself condemned to recapitulate all the ageold distinctions of  difference Tiresias redivivusl   The quality of tendentiousness is representative of the sacred differ ence that each faction strives to wrest from the other and that shifts  from one side to the other with everincreasing speed as the rival  insights come into contact It is a quality that perhaps applies to inter pretation itself whether it is an analysis of Oedipus the King or a  quarrel over psychoanalysis and other modern methodologies Ostensi bly the sole object in dispute is the cultureincrisis of which each  antagonist flatters himself he is the true champion Everybody is intent  on diagnosing the illness in order to find a cure But in fact the illness is  the other the other with his false diagnoses and poisonous prescrip tions When real responsibilities vanish the game remains unchanged     206 Violence and the Sacred   in fact it is all the better for being played without stakes with each  contestant striving to outshine his neighbor rather than trying to shed  real light on the supposed object of their concern   All in all the modern crisis like all sacrificial crises can be defined as  the elimination of differences The interplay of antagonisms actually  does the eliminating without ever being recognized for what it truly  is the increasingly feeble increasingly tragic intervention of an en feebled difference This difference appears to be always growing but  it fades away whenever someone tries to appropriate it Each faction is  mystified by the isolated restructurings increasingly fragile and transi tory which lend their support to each of the antagonists in turn The  final degradation of the mythic element takes the form of a prolifera tion of rival and mutually destructive forms whose relationship to the  myth itself is highly ambiguous These forms are demystifying as well  as mythic that is they are mythic in the very nature of their demystifi cation which is never illusory to be sure but is always restricted to  the other myth The myths of demystification cling to the great col lective myth and draw nourishment from it rather like worms feeding  on a corpse   Greek tragedy which acknowledges the influence of this process  clearly has more to say about it than does psychoanalysis which claims  immunity from it Only by studiously ignoring those texts that  threaten to undermine their system do psychoanalysts maintain their  complacency Although they concede that artistic beauty is worthy of  reverence and awe they scornfully dismiss the actual work as fanciful  effete narcoticthe antithesis of hard scientific truth Critics consider  the work of art a passive object that will yield its secrets on command  to all adherents of the latest form of absolute knowledge whatever  that form may be   As far as I can see this process of mystifying demystification has  been fully comprehended by artists but never by psychoanalysts or  sociologists What is most remarkable is the role played by literary  critics Not infrequently they inveigh against the scientists for what ever hardheaded insights they may actually have contributed to an  understanding of the creative process Yet at the same time they echo  the scientists belief that literature is basically innocuous and ulti mately meaningless and seem to share their a priori conviction that no  work of literature has anv direct relation to reality   We have on occasion observed Sophocles demystifying psycho analysis but we shall never see psychoanalysis demystifying Sophocles  In fact psychoanalytic thought has never really come to grips with  Sophocles Only at his best as in the case discussed above does Freud  manage to move even parallel to him     Totem and Taboo and the Incest Prohibition 207   To examine a work of art from the perspective of the surrogate  victim and its attendant mechanism is to consider it in terms of collec tive violence and to attempt to discover what the work omits as much  if not moreas what it includes That is surely an essential first step  in any critical venture Yet at first glance the task may seem futile any  practical application to literature seems destined to end in broad gen eralities and esoteric abstractions   Returning to the text of Freud however we find that such is not the  case Here we encounter an omission that is conspicuous not to say  astonishing if we take the context into account   In any general discussion of Greek tragedy there is a tendency to  refer either implicidy or explicidy to one particular work that exempli fies the genre This practice was initiated by Aristotle and is still in  force today And when ones name is Sigmund Freud one has every  reason to adhere to the convention   And yet Freud did not do so It is of course Oedipus the King that  springs to mind in connection with Freud and we have ourselves  already had recourse to the play but Freud does not make the slightest  allusion to itneither in the passage I have cited nor in the pages  preceding and following it There are references to Attis Adonis  Tammuz Mithra the Titans Dionysus Christianityin the name of  demystification of coursebut there is no mention of Oedipus as a  tragic hero nor any reference to the play about him   It can be objected that Oedipus the King is after all only one  tragedy among many nothing obliges Freud to make any specific ref erence to it The fact that it is not specifically referred to does not  mean that Freud has specifically excluded it One can just as well  conclude that he has simply incorporated this particular tragedy into  his total picture of tragedy and thus taken it into consideration   However this line of argument is not valid Once our attention has  been drawn to the absence of the archetypal tragedy details come to  mind that suggest that its absence is due neither to chance nor to  accident   On rereading Freuds definition of tragic gutlty we realize that it  cannot be made applicable to Oedipus the King The hero has to bear  the burden of what was known as tragic guilt the basis of that guilt is  not always easy to find for in the light of our everyday life it is often  no guilt at all This definition applies to some tragediesbut not to  Oedipus the King There is nothing vague or indefinite about the  source of Oedipus guilt at least not in the eyes of Freud and his  followers   Can it be that Freud did not think of Oedipus at this juncture that  he simply forgot about himthat Oedipus slipped his mind It is easy     208 Violence and the Sacred   to imagine what that voracious pack of neopsychoanalytic blood hounds hot on the trail of Totem and Taboo will deduce from such a  lapse or slip Far from seeing in Totem and Taboo a classic example  in conformity with the usual diagnostic pattern of the return of a  repressed subject they will undoubtedly recognize here the ultimate  example of extreme repressionOedipuss surprising and momentous  journey to the innermost recesses of the Freudian unconscious   The Freud of Totem and Taboo then is in such a state that he has  repressed all references to Oedipus Such a proposition is truly mind boggling   Fortunately another possibility presents itself In the passage just  quoted there occurs a modest qualifier that may be of importance In  the light of our everyday life Freud cautions us tragic guilt is often  no guilt at all The word often serves to warn us that the assertion  is not invariably valid it admits the possibility of exceptional tragedies  or at the very least of one exceptional tragedy That admission seems  relevant here In at least one tragedy Freud is saying there is a case of  tragic guilt that would be readily accepted as such in everyday exis tence it involves patricide and incest This modifying often is ex plicit it cannot be interpreted as ignoring Oedipus In fact there is  reason to believe that it was inserted specifically with Oedipus in mind   Throughout Totem and Taboo Oedipus is conspicuous by his ab sence The omission is not a natural or an unconscious one it is wholly  conscious and deliberate We do not have to do with Freuds com plexes here but with his conscious motiveswhich it should be said  are a good deal more varied and interesting than his complexes We  must ask ourselves why Freud has suddenly made Oedipus the object  of a systematic act of exclusion   If we examine this exclusion not only in its immediate context but in  that of the work itself it seems even more troubling For what after all  is the subject of Totem and Taboo Is Freud not dealing with the  father the father of the primitive tribe who was destined to be mur dered Freuds subject is patricidethe very crime Freud believed he  had discovered at the heart of Greek tragedy a crime projected by the  criminals onto their victims Certainly it is the very crime that first  Tiresias and then all of Thebes attributed to the unfortunate Oedipus  It would be hard to imagine a more economical and more telling ar gument in favor of the theory of tragedy advanced in Totem and  Taboo than a simple comparison of this theory with the content of  Oedipus the King And yet Freud says not a word about the play It is  all we can do to keep from tugging at the sleeve of the celebrated     Totem and Taboo and the Incest Prohibition 209   inventor of the Oedipuskomplex to remind him that there exists a  tragedy that deals precisely with the subject of patricide   Why did Freud choose to dispense with this striking example  There is only one answer he could not use Oedipus the King in an  interpretation that linked tragedy to an actual case of patricide without  undermining his other standard interpretation the official psycho analytic interpretation which presents Oedipus the King as a simple  reflection of unconscious desires that formally excludes any execution  of these desires Oedipus here appears in a strange relationship to his  own complex As a primordial fatherfigure he has no father of his  own and thus can scarcely be said to have any complexes regarding his  paternity   On a broader and more general plane we cannot view Oedipuss  crimes in their true light observe patricide and incest in a context that  includes phenomena of the scapegoat variety no matter how dimly  they may appear without giving rise to questions that challenge the  very basis of psychoanalytic thought   A question mark cropped up in Freuds work and because he had no  answer at hand he chose to ignore it A more prudent author would  have simply suppressed all the passages in Totem and Taboo relating to  tragedy Fortunately prudence was not one of Freuds characteristics  It is the richness of his ideas their intuitive interest that Freud savored  he therefore decided to preserve them all while carefully sidestepping  any embarrassing allusions to Oedipus the King   Freuds censorship of the Oedipus references was not exercised in  any psychoanalytic sense but as an act of censorship pure and simple  That is not to say however that his intention was to deceive Freud  was fully confident that given time he would be able to answer all  questions without violating the basic premises of psychoanalysis but  as always he was in a hurry He therefore put the question aside for  future consideration without realizing that the answer would never be  forthcoming   If Freud had attempted to resolve the contradiction he would prob ably have realized that neither his first nor his second reading of Oedi pus the King had succeeded in coming to grips either with the Oedipus  myth or with tragedy as a whole Neither repressed desire nor an  actual act of patricide are really satisfactory answers and the obstinate  duality of Freuds theories both here and throughout his work sug gests that a certain distortion has taken place In avoiding the true  problem Freud turned away from what was potentially the most  profitable line of inquiry one that might finally have led him to the  surrogate victim Behind Freuds exclusion of Oedipus from Totem     210 Violence and the Sacred   and Taboo an initial act that constitutes a deliberate tactical maneuver  it is possible to perceive a second inadvertent and unconscious act of  exclusion that in fact determines the structure of the whole work  Here again psychoanalysis offers no explanation And there is no point  in asking psychoanalysis to explain an exclusion which among other  things lays the groundwork for psychoanalysis itself   The parentheses around Oedipus the King constitute a sort of criti cal hiatus a protective barrier surrounding the theory of psychoanaly sis Earlier we had a glimpse of the same process operating in  connection with mimetic desire there too it was a question of defend ing the Oedipus complex from possible attack In the hierarchy of  Freudian themes this complex maintains a priveleged position that de fines Freuds historical limitations as a thinker It represents the point  beyond which deconstruction of the myth cannot go   We find too the same contrast between Freud and his successors as  we did in the case of mimetic desire Freud attempted to isolate and  neutralize the insights that threatened to contaminate the purity of his  doctrine but he was too gifted and too vital to reject them entirely  and he had too great a love for intellectual exploration to suppress his  most adventurous observations His followers however did not share  this boldness They set out to eliminate all incongruities from his work  and their censorship extended to the vital issue of mimetic desire on  the one hand and on the other to all of Totem and Taboo The  passages on tragedy seem never to have exerted any influence even the  most devoutly Freudian of literary critics has failed to make use of  them And yet it is these passages alone that contain Freuds most  striking literary insight   If the great advance of Totem and Taboo is also a kind of detour  and the work seems to end in an impasse this is due to the heavy  burden of psychoanalytic dogma with which the author approaches his  text Naturally he is unwilling to relinquish this burden which he has  come to regard as his most precious possession The major obstacle is  the theme of the father By transforming the crucial revelation of  collective murder into an act of patricide the paternal theme provides  Freuds psychoanalytic adversaries and others with the very argu ments they need to discredit his theoiy It is the paternal theme that  skews Freuds interpretation of tragedy preventing him from settling  the problem of incest interdiction in a wholly satisfactory manner   As we have seen the intrusion of the collective murder into Totem  and Taboo fails to answer the problems raised by the incest interdic tions and can even be said to stand in the way of their solution It  breaks the continuity between the sexual monopoly of the awesome     Totem and Taboo and the Incest Prohibition 211   father figure and the historical strength of the interdictions In an  initial effort to restore this continuity Freud resorts to a piece of  juggling which however fails of its effect   What up to then had been prevented by his the fathers actual existence  was thenceforward prohibited by the sons themselves in accordance  with the psychological procedure so familiar to us in psychoanalysis  under the name of deferred obedience They revoked their deed by  forbidding the killing of the totem the substitute for their father and  they renounced its fruits by resigning their claim to the women who had  now been set free They thus created out of their filial sense of guilt the  two fundamental taboos of totemism which for that very reason in evitably corresponded to the two repressed wishes of the Oedipus com plex13   Freud shows that he recognizes the fragility of this argument by  immediately introducing a supplementary proof As is so often the case  with this ingenious but hasty thinker these new arguments are not  only additional supports for the old ones but they constitute a wholly  fresh theory that surreptitiously challenges certain fundamental as sumptions of psychoanalysis   The prohibition of incest    has a powerful practical basis as well  Sexual desires do not unite men but divide them Though the brothers  had banded together in order to overcome their father they were all  one anothers rivals in regard to the women Each of them would have  wished like his father to have all the women to himself The new or ganization would have collapsed in a struggle of all against all for none  of them was of such overmastering strength as to be able to take on his  fathers part with success Thus the brothers had no alternative if they  were to live together butnot perhaps until they had passed through  many dangerous crisesto institute the law against incest by which  they all alike renounced the women whom they desired and who had  been their chief motive for dispatching their father14   In the first quotation the father has been dead only a short time and  his memory pervades everything In the second his death has receded  in time we might almost say that it is repeated afresh this time in  Freuds imagination Freud sees himself following the avatars of the  clan after the act of collective murder proceeding through time step  by step In fact he is gradually disengaging himself from the confines  of modern family life that have held him prisoner All family relation  13 ibid p 143   Ibid p 144     272 Violence and the Sacred   ships blur and fade away For instance it is no longer possible to  determine the degree of concupiscence by the closeness of the blood  tie All the women are now on the same level Each of them would  have wished like his father to have all the women to himself Moth ers and sisters become a cause of rivalry not because they are  intrinsically more desirable but simply because they happen to be at  hand Desire no longer seeks out a priveleged object   Although this rivalry is initially sexual it eventually attains a scope  and intensity that is hardly justified by sexual appetite alone Freud  himself makes that clear No one can hope to emulate the great feats of  the father for none of them was of such overmastering strength as to  be able to take on his fathers part with success There are a thousand  pretexts for such a rivalry because in the last analysis its sole object is  the attainment of sovereign violence On one side there are only the  women and on the other the men who are unable to divide the  women among themselves The situation described by Freud has sup posedly arisen because of the death of the dominant father but now  everything takes place as if the father had never existed The emphasis  has shifted to the enemy brothers who are virtually indistinguishable  from one another and we now find ourselves caught up in the familiar  process of reciprocal violence confronting the symmetrical patterns of  the sacrificial crisis   Freud here approaches the ultimate cause of the incest taboo as he  moves away from his habitual psychoanalytical themes That is the  way of tragedy itself the way of indirTerentiation that Freud as we  have seen brings into Totem and Taboo with his description of the  chorus of enemy brothers A crowd of people all with the same name  and similarly attired   The interdiction is no longer presented as a consequence of a psy chological procedure so familiar to us in psychoanalysis but of the  urgent necessity of preventing a struggle of all against all that would  bring about the collapse of the society We are now dealing with a  concrete fact Sexual desires do not unite men but divide them   Freud does not make the slightest allusion to his initial theory  Without seeming even to realize it he is clearing the scene of com plexes and fantasies to make way for real functions which wTill now  provide the basis for the interdictions Freud who contributed to so  much of the confusion and misunderstanding concerning the nature of  religion became in Totem and Taboo the first to proclaim the true  function of incest interdictions And he was also the first to turn his  back on his own revelations     Totem and Taboo and the Incest Prohibition 213   GSfl THE SECOND THEORY is superior to the first in its  explanation of the function of the prohibitions In discussing the origin  of these prohibitions it asserts that the brothers eventually come to an  amicable agreement concerning their mutual renunciation of the  women   However the absolute character of the prohibition excludes the  possibility that it might originate in a negotiated peace If the men  were indeed capable of arriving at some sort of mutual agreement it is  certain that all the women would not have fallen under the same ir revocable taboo Some sort of division of the goods would surely have  been arranged   Freud suspected that in such circumstances violence was bound to  triumph That was why he referred to the serious dissensions that  would inevitably precede the final agreement and the forceful argu ments that were meant to bring home to the warring brothers the  gravity of their situation If violence is unleashed prohibitions become  indispensable for without them human society would vanish Yet is  there any reason why human society should not vanish Freud says  nothing that makes a reconciliation necessary or even possiblea  reconciliation that must be brought about by means of a prohibition as  irrationar and affective to use Freuds terms as the prohibition  concerning incest An antiincestuous social contract is hardly a con vincing proposition and the theory that had such a promising begin ning falters at its conclusion   Although Freuds second theory marks an advance on the first in its  explanation of the function of prohibitions it is less satisfactory than  the first in regard to origins The true outcome was to have eluded the  brothers it eluded Freud instead   I have attempted to follow step by step the path that led from the  first theory to the second In so doing I have focused on the dynamics  of a line of thought that is ridding itself little by little of all cultural  and family ties It is now clear that this line of thought never achieves  its goal The second incest theory follows the same pattern as the  passages on tragedy Both brothers and women are reduced to the  anonymity of complete equality but the father retains his separateness  Because he is dead he is immune from the operation of indifferentia tion He is the only one who does not relinquish his family role in the  course of the proceedings and unfortunately his is the crucial role  Freud manages to defilialize the sons but he goes no further The  line of thought that breaks off here needs to be drawn out to its  conclusion the father has to be depaternalized   To pursue Freuds train of thought to a conclusion does not involve     214 Violence and the Sacred   rejecting the role of the murder whose importance is confirmed by  ample ethnological evidence Rather it involves rejecting the role of  the father transcending the family framework and the dogma of psy choanalysis   The overbearing presence of the father figure intervenes constantly  concealing the mechanism of religion and preventing Freud from  articulating the true character of the sacrificial rites festivals and all  the other evidence Every sentence that begins Psychoanalysis dem onstrates    or Psychoanalysis has revealed    invariably evades  the true explanation Psychoanalysis has revealed that the totem ani mal is in reality a substitute for the father and this tallies with the  contradictor fact that though the killing of the animal is as a rule  forbidden yet its killing is a festive occasionwith the fact that it is  killed and not mourned15   In fact the father explains nothing If we hope to get to the root of  the matter we must put the father out of our minds and concentrate on  the fact that the enormous impression made on the community by the  collective murder is not due to the victims identity per se but to his  role as unifying agent In other words this impression derives from the  wave of unanimity reestablished by the victims presence and directed  against the victim It is this conjunction of by and against that  explains the apparent contradictions of the religious practices the con stant need to repeat the killing even though the victim is divine  indeed because it is divine   It is not the theme of collective murder that constitutes the weakness  of Totem and Taboo but the mass of psychoanalytical material that  obscures that theme If only Freud had shifted his attention away from  the arguments that precede the murder and that he hoped would pro vide a motivation for it if only he had been willing to jettison his  psychoanalytic explanations then he would have seen that the violence  occurs without reason that the murder has no meaning outside itself   Once the murder has been stripped of its associations with the father  figure the reason for its tremendous impact on the community be comes plain as does the secret of its success of its ritual repetitions and  the double judgment that invariably accompanies it To understand all  this is to realize that the conclusion to the second theory which the  enemy brothers are vainly trying to reach has already been found by  Freud and indeed constitutes his main theme anything that prevents  the act of murder from becoming merely an unalloyed operation of  the surrogate victim also prevents it from taking place at its truly  appropriate time at the endnot the beginningof the sacrificial  crisis   15 Ibid p 141     Totem and Taboo and the Incest Prohibition 215   Only the surrogate victim is capable of bringing the inconclusive  second theory to a conclusion only its intervention can put an end to  the violence and effect a union of the two incest theories Instead of  serving as a futile and even obstructive prologue to the crisis of the  brothers the murder can play a crucial role at the end providing the  resolution to the crisis oudined by Freud himself and a point of depar ture for the cultural order Indeed that murder must be the ultimate  source of all incest prohibitions   e4 UP TO THIS POINT I have limited my examination of  incest prohibitions to the context of Totem and Taboo My reading of  the work has led me to suppose that the roots of these prohibitions as  of many other facets of the cultural order are embedded in generative  violence Freud was the first to link the problem of prohibitions to that  of sacrifice and the first who sought to resolve the two problems by  means of the collective murder If Freuds explanation of sacrifice must  be adjusted in favor of the surrogate victim then we must assume that  the same will apply to his account of incest prohibitions But before I  embark on this question I would like to make it clear that even though  this adjustment may favor my own line of enquiry it does no violence  to the basic premises of Freuds study It introduces no elements not  already contained therein and in fact owes its origins to the inherent  dynamism and suggestiveness of Freuds work   Let us briefly recall the role played by the primitive horde in Totem  and Taboo Darwins hypothesis offers a clearcut explanation of the  incest prohibitions and it is obvious that Freuds initial attraction to  the hypothesis stems from this fact The hypothesis appears in the  course of an initial discussion of exogamy The second important  hypothesis of Totem and Taboothis one wholly Freudsconcerns  collective murder and must have been formulated somewhat later as a  result of Freuds readings in ethnology Initially then the two hy potheses are independent of one another Darwin makes no mention of  the collective murder on the other hand there is nothing relating to  Darwins theory of the primitive horde in the ethnological material  that suggested the theme of the collective murder   Freud attempted to wed the two theories and the result was a mix ture of history and prehistory whose arbitrary quality has frequendy  been noted Equally dubious is Freuds claim to have extracted from  cultural documents of relatively recent date material pertaining to an  event supposedly unique and situated in a fabulous and distant past   Freuds argument not only fails to carry conviction but also con tributes nothing to the insights that form the true substance of the  work If Freud took up the primitive horde theory because of the     216 Violence and the Sacred   possibilities it offered for dealing with the problem of prohibitions it is  hard to see why he did not renounce it once the murder concept by  breaking the link between the sexual privilege of the primordial father  and the prohibitions had for all practical purposes eliminated these  possibilities   Again if Freud meant to develop his murder theory he had no  reason to cling to the horde which is hindered rather than helped by  the concept of the murder Ultimately the two theories are incom patible and one must choose between them Because the best part of  Totem and Taboo is devoted to a presentation of the murder theory  and a demonstration that the murder is the consequence of all the  religious and ethnological data at our disposal it is natural to assume  that ultimately Freud would have opted for the murder theory More over the horde is irrelevant here its initial usefulness seems to have  been dissipated   However Freud made no such choice He kept the murder and  declined to renounce the horde never realizing that the horde had now  lost its raison detre The reason for this lapsus is clear the horde  theory refers the collective murder to the sphere of the father figure  Consequently the precious axioms of psychoanalysis are preserved  The primitive horde is a perfect materialization of the psychoanalystic  myth Once again we brush against invisible barriers beyond which  Freuds logic never ventures   Here again Freuds successors seem to emphasize the regressive  aspect of his thought The murdered father1 theory of Totem and  Taboo is clearly indefensible but the vulnerable element is not the  murder but the father And although the arguments of Freuds  successors have some merit if taken literally we cannot respect their  rejection of the work as a whole While purporting to attack the  weaknesses of Freuds concept they are in fact seeking to suppress its  strengths It is at once paradoxical and highly significant that Freuds  heirshis sons so to speakshould draw on one of their fathers  principal weaknesses that timidity that they themselves share in order  to purge his doctrine of all elements that are foreign to their own way  of thinking Yet it is precisely those elements that constitute the truly  important and innovative aspect of Totem and Taboo When the  effort is made to separate true from false the false is invariably paraded  as the true The error lies in the concept of the father and the applica tion of psychoanalysis the truth lies in the concept of the collective  murder and strange as it may seem in Freuds ethnology A fresh and  constructive reading of the work should lead us to reject almost all the  elements that psychoanalysts recognize as valid and to acknowledge  the validity of those very elements that psychoanalysts reject     Totem and Taboo and the Incest Prohibition 277   In the course of this investigation it has become clear that Totem  ind Taboo is more compatible with the theory of the surrogate victim  is the foundation of culture than is anv other modern work Thus in  spite of the manifold difficulties created by the impossibilities in the  Freudian theoryimpossibilities that had hitherto discredited itwe  were able to acknowledge a great insight in Totem mid Taboo   The overlapping of theories in Freuds work their profusion and  multiplicity can only be interpreted as a sign of failure As soon as the  surrogate victim is introduced into the picture the scattered fragments  of Freuds speculations come together like pieces in a puzzle In their  fragmentary state the Freudian analyses have little to tell us but when  once they have been drawn together by means of the surrogate victim  their impact appears momentous and it can hardly be claimed that this  new unity was imposed from the outside We have only to cease  regarding Freuds thought in terms of infallible dogma to see that he  was always fundamentally concerned with the operation of the surro gate victim and was constantly though hesitatingly attempting to  come to terms with that question   I could easily extend my demonstration to other works of Freud  These works should be analyzed in the same manner as we analyze  rites For any cultural interpretation is ultimately only another form of  rite as such it stems from the operation of the surrogate victim and  can be fully systematized and analyzed only in its light   The comparative approach should yield the common denominator of  those works of Freud that complement without ever quite repeating or  duplicating each other The many different elements that make up  these related texts obscure their fundamental unity yet that unity lies  near at hand   Freuds Moses and Monotheism seems to complement Totem and  Taboo in many respects Just as in Totem and Taboo we encounter  prior to the murder a father and sonthat is a familyso in Moses  and Monotheism we encounter prior to the murder the story of  Moses and the Mosaic religionthat is society iMoses plays a role  similar to that of the primordial father And the Hebrew people de prived of their prophet by Moses death resemble the group of broth ers deprived of their father after the murder described in Totem and  Taboo   Once again all the possible implications of the act of collective  violence can be set forth in advance If we deduct all those that pertain  exclusively to Totem and Taboo on the one hand and on the other all  those with relevance only to Aloses and Monotheism that is the im plications for the family in the former work and for the people the  nation and the Jewish religion in the latter work we find that we are     218 Violence and the Sacred   left with a single common denominator the metamorphosis of re ciprocal violence into generative violence by means of the murder of  somebody no matter nxhoma figure chosen as it were at random   Similarly in order to bring about a synthesis of the two Freudian  theories on the origin of incest prohibitions the collective murder  must be taken out of the familial framework of the first theory and  incorporated into the societal framework of the second theory   My own theories are based upon this operation of double synthesis  In fact their primary concern is that point where all the Freudian  interpretations examined here begin to converge No sooner does the  generative violence make its appearance caught up in the Freudian  dynamics than we begin to anticipate the slight modifications that  permit it to assume its function as a universal bonda function that in  turn derives from its role as a universal structural support   We are not indulging in impressionistic literary criticism but in  objective research The fact that we can proceed further than Freud  down a path of his own choosing offers us valuable insight into his  wrork It becomes possible to finish phrases left dangling by the author  to determine why and when his thought went astray in short to place  him precisely In his Essay on Psychoanalysis Freud comes as close to  the concept of mimetic desire as he does to that of generative violence  in Totem and Taboo and Moses and Monotheism In each instance the  distance from the objective is the same as is the margin of error the  basic standpoint remains unchanged   Desire for most modern thinkers is anchored in an object In order  to perceive the implications of an infinitely mobile mimesis we must  realize that the boundless potentiality of violence can only be con tained by the operation of the surrogate victim After all we cannot  postulate the existence in man of a desire radically disruptive of human  relations without simultaneously postulating the means of keeping this  desire in check To free ourselves forever from the illusions of human ism there is only one requirement wrhich happens to be the very one  that modern men refuse to meet we must acknowledge mankinds  thorough dependence on religion This it is plain Freud was not in clined to do He was not alone in his subservience to an increasingly  enfeebled humanist ideal he had no notion of the intellectual revolu tion for which he was paving the way        HOW ARE WE TO IMAGINE the birth of cultural  prohibitions It must be thought of concurrently with all other cul tural births The divine epiphany the universal upsurge of the mon strous double engulfs the community and simultaneously makes its  presence felt at all points of conflict It passes between the enemy     Totem and Taboo and the Incest Prohibition 219   brothers who fall back thunderstruck Whatever the pretext for the  conflict may have beenfood weapons land womenthe antagonists  suspend their struggle now and forever Henceforth everything  touched by the sacred violence belongs to the gods as such it becomes  the object of a most solemn prohibition   The antagonists have been sobered and thoroughly frightened From  now on they will do everything possible to keep from relapsing into  reciprocal violence Moreover divine anger has taught them that pre ventive measures are necessary Wherever violence occurs a prohibi tion is proclaimed   The sentence weighs on all the women who figured as prizes in the  rivalry that is on all women who live within a groupnot because  they are intrinsically more desirable but because they are near at hand  and therefore likely objects of rivalry The prohibition always covers  the closest instances of consanguinity but its outer limits are not  necessarily confined to blood relations   Both the principle of prohibition and the forms it takes are not  without their practical uses It would be untrue to say that they were  designed to deal with an imaginary situation on the contrary they  serve to prevent people from being caught up in violent mimesis As  we saw in the previous chapter the prohibitions of primitive peoples  display a knowledge of violence and its ways that surpasses our mod ern comprehension The reason is clear the prohibitions were dictated  by violence itself by the violent manifestations of a previous crisis and  they are fixed in place as a bulwark against similar outbursts If the  prohibitions seem evenly matched with the violence they are directed  against that is because in the final analysis the two are one and the  same That explains why in times of crisis the prohibitions ultimately  contribute to the very violence they are designed to suppress Like any  other form of sacrificial prophylaxis prohibitions can on occasion turn  against their users   All the evidence seems to confirm the proposal set forth at the  outset of this work that sexuality is part of the larger problem of  violence and the sacred Sexual prohibitions like all other prohibitions  are sacrificial in nature and all legitimate sexuality is sacrificial Strictly  speaking between members of the same community legitimate sexual ity exists no more than legitimate violence in the community The  prohibitions involving incest and those directed against murder or rit ual killing among members of the same community have a common  origin and function That is why they resemble one another and why  in many cases as Robertson Smith has pointed out they cover exacdy  the same ground   Like blood sacrifice legitimate sexuality that of matrimonial     220 Violence and the Sacred   unions never chooses its victims among those who live together  The regulations governing marriage resemble the regulations govern ing the choice of sacrificial victims All these regulations serve to  endow both sexuality and violence with the same centrifugal force In  many instances the sacrificial deviations of sexuality and violence are  virtually indistinguishable Marriage vows can be duly attended by  ritualized violence analogous to other forms of ritual warfare This  systematized violence resembles the endless cycle of revenge that  might well rage inside if there were no substitute for it outside the  community and the reciprocal exchange of violence with outsiders is  one with the exchange of women that provides men with sexual ob jects from outside the community The problem is always the same  violence is both the disease inside and the cure outside Violence  like sexual desire must be forbidden wherever its presence is incom patible with communal existence   Even today legitimized sexuality in the West reveals traces of its  sacrificial character The sexual relation of husband and wife is the  central and fundamental issue of family life After all it is the origin of  family lifeand yet it is kept out of sight and plays no part strictly  speaking in family life As far as the closest relatives particularly the  children are concerned the sexual relation of husband and wife does  not exist It is sometimes as thoroughly hidden as that most secret son  of violence generative violence itself Psychoanalysis is wrong I be lieve to attribute to young children a knowledge of parental sexuality   Surrounding this legitimized sexuality is a vast expanse of forbidder  territory defined by the whole gamut of sexual prohibitions Withii  this territory all sexual activity sexual allusions and erotic stimulant  are forbidden So within the immediate environs of the temple and ii  the area surrounding the place of sacrifice any form of violence i  strictly forbidden Beneficial and lifegiving but also dangerous regu  lated sexual violence like ritual murder is surrounded by a veritabl  buffer zone If it were granted free rein to propagate itself within th  community it would become evil and destructive   Primitive societies are generally more hemmed in by prohibitior  than Western society has ever been However many of them ai  unfamiliar with some of our own particular prohibitions We mu  take care not to interpret the relative liberty of these primitive peopl  as presenting an ideological contrast as standing in direct opposition t  the repression characteristic of our own society especially and mo  notoriously in the sexual realm The vast importance attributed i  sexuality by humanists and naturalists is after all a modern and Wes  ern phenomenon In primitive societies wherever sexual activity is n     Totem and Taboo and the Incest Prohibition 221   ther legitimized that is seen as ritual either in a strict or a broad  sense nor prohibited it seems to be regarded as a matter of little or no  importance in other words it is too trivial to provoke internal vio lence This is the case in certain societies with regard to the sexual  activities of children and unmarried adolescents or with regard to  sexual dealings with foreigners as well as naturally the sexual activities  among foreigners   Prohibitions serve a basic function They maintain a sort of sanctu ary at the heart of the community an area where that minimum of  nonviolence essential to the survival of the children and the commu nitys cultural heritageessential in short to everything that sustains  mans humanityis jealously preserved If prohibitions capable of per forming this function actually exist one can hardly attribute them to  the beneficence of Nature that good angel of complacent humanism  the last relic of those optimistic theologies engendered by the deteriora tion of historical Christianity It should now be apparent that human itys very existence is due primarily to the operation of the surrogate  victim We know that animals possess individual braking mechanisms  against violence animals of the same species never fight to the death  but the victor spares the life of the vanquished Mankind lacks this  protection Our substitution for the biological mechanism of the ani mals is the collective cultural mechanism of the surrogate victim  There is no society without religion because without religion society  cannot exist   Ethnologists should long since have drawn on their cumulative evi dence to explain the function of these prohibitions and even to dis cover their origins The act of violence performed in the course of a  rite or a festival points the way clearly enough for it hinges on sacrifi cial practices or on totemic ceremonies And if we also examine the  disastrous or merely disturbing consequences attributed to nonritual ized violations we see that they always boil down to halfmythical  halfreal manifestations of the sacrificial crisis Thus what motivates  prohibition is the fear of violence Just because this violence can be  disguised behind a contagious illness a drought or a flood we do not  have the right to dismiss this fear as superstition1 Modern philoso phers invariably choose as representative the most irrational and  bizarre at any rate to modern eyes aspects of religious prohibitions  Thus they manage to convince themselves that religion has no connec tion with reality   This misconception cannot prevail much longer The real function  of prohibition was brought to light by Freud and although it was  almost immediately discarded bv him it has recentlv been reformu    222 Violence and the Sacred   lated with great precision by Georges Bataille To be sure Bataille is  primarily inclined to treat violence in terms of some rare and precious  condiment the only spice still capable of stimulating the jaded appetite  of modern man Yet on occasion Bataille is able to transcend the deca dent estheticism he has so fervently espoused and explain quite simply  that the prohibition eliminates violence and our violent impulses in cluding those resulting from our sexual drives destroy our inner calm  without which human consciousness cannot exist16   16 Georges Bataille VErotimie Paris 1965 p 43        Chapter Nine   LeviStrauss Structuralism  and Marriage Laws   CJKM1 T H E U N 1 T O F STRUCTURE from which a kinship        system is built up is the group which I call an elementary   family consisting of a man and his wife with their child or children  The existence of the elementary family creates three special kinds of  social relationships that between parent and child that between children  of the same parents siblings and that between husband and wife as  parents of the same child or children    The three relationships that  exist within the elementary family constitute what 1 call the first order  Relationships of the second order are those which depend on the con nection of two elementary families through a common member and are  such as fathers father mothers brother wifes sister and so on In the  third order are such as fathers brothers son and mothers brothers wife  Thus we can trace if we have the genealogical information relationships  of the fourth fifth or nth order1   In outlining the basic premises of his own research A R Radcliffe Brown sets forth the principles that prevailed in the study of kinship  before LeviStrauss arrived on the scene In an article entitled Struc tural Analysis in Linguistics and in Anthropology2 LeviStrauss  quotes the above passage as the counter position to his own meth odology which was to set the pattern for structuralist studies of kinship   According to LeviStrauss the elementary family is based on mar riage and is therefore not an irreducible unit Far from being elemen tary it is by definition composite It is to be regarded as an end point  rather than a point of departure the result of an exchange between  two groups that share no biological affiliations Kinship is allowed to  establish and perpetrate itself only through specific forms of marriage  In other words the relationships which RadcliffeBrown calls relation  1 A R RadclifFeBrown The Study of Kinship Systems Journal of the Royal  Anthropological Institute 71 19412   2 Claude LeviStrauss Structural Anthropology trans Claire Jacobson and  Brooke Grundfest New York 1963 154     224 Violence and the Sacred   ships of the first order are a function of and depend on those which  he considers secondary and derived The essence of human kinship is  to require the establishment of relations among what RadcliffeBrown  calls elementary families Thus it is not the families isolated terms  which are truly Elementary but rather the relations between those  terms3   We must be wary of common sense which never loses sight of  the actual biological relationship linking RadcliffeBrowns elemen tary family and which refuses to regard the system as a system Of  course the biological family is ubiquitous in human society But what  confers upon kinship its sociocultural character is not what it retains  from nature but rather the essential way in which it diverges from  nature A kinship system does not consist in the objective ties of  descent or consanguinity between individuals It exists only in human  consciousness it is an arbitrary system of representations not the  spontaneous development of a real situation4   The arbitrary element is assimilated to what has been called here the  symbolic character of the system Two entitiesin this case two  individualsare brought together not by necessity but by symbolic  thought two crosscousins let us say are joined in marriage and the  circumstances that necessitated the marriage can be attributed to  social convention rather than to any real need The fact that a type of  marriage permitted or even required in one society is formally forbid den in another makes this point clear   Are we therefore to conclude that kinship systems in general are  essentially unnatural As the last quotation from LeviStrauss demon strates his pronouncements on this question are more cautious and  more finely shaded than some of his critics have led us to believe After  explaining that the kinship system is not the spontaneous development  of a real situation he remarks that this certainly does not mean that  the real situation is automatically contradicted or that it is to be sim ply ignored RadcliffeBrown has shown in studies that are now clas sic that even systems which are apparently extremely rigid and  artificial such as the Australian systems of marriageclasses take bio logical parenthood carefully into account5   The point seems clear enough in this context Yet it is the very point  that could be misinterpreted in different circumstances through a hastyr   or overzealous application of LeviStrausss own discoveries  LeviStrausss homage to RadcliffeBrown whose views he had   convincingly refuted a few lines further back is no mere formality   3 Ibid p 50   Ibid   Ibid     LeviStrauss Structuralism and Marriage Laws 225   But there is reason to question whether LeviStrausss acknowledgment  deals adequately with the issue Kinship systems we are informed  even those which are apparently extremely rigid and artificial    take  biological parenthood carefully into account That is certainly true  as far as it goes There is however a good deal more to be said   Men can take into account only those concepts that are already  accessible to their understanding The phrase implies that the concept  of biological kinship exists outside the kinship system that is outside  culture This notion strikes me as inconceivable We must take care  not to confuse two distinct realities 1 the fact of biological kinship  the actual process of human reproduction and 2 an understanding of  these same procedures a recognition of the functioning of generation  and consanguinity It is obvious that men must always behave accord ing to the first reality insofar as they cannot reproduce themselves by  any other means than those prescribed by the laws of biology This is  as true for men living within a culture as for those who might live in  a state of nature where promiscuity would be the rule As for the  second reality however that is a very different matter for if sexual  promiscuity prevailed the conditions would not exist that make pos sible the discovery of biological laws   It might be objected that I am drifting into abstractions On the  contrary my purpose is to expose a speculative assumption tacitly  accepted and wholly without basis that is part and parcel of the mod ern naturalist myththe belief that a particular affinity exists between  the state of nature and biological truth or even scientific truth in  general   There is then no difference between nature and culture in regard to  the mere biological facts of human reproduction In regard to the  understanding of these facts however a difference assuredly exists  and it is to the detriment of nature In order to appreciate the truth of  this statement we need only consider what happens to a litter of cats  left to breed at random The result inevitably is a hopelessly tangled  network of marriage alliances blood relationships and inlaw relation ships that would confound even the most assiduous student of ele mentary or as we would say nuclear families   No matter how bewildering such a spectacle might be it would not  rid us of the conviction that the three types of family relationships  described by RadcliffeBrown are indeed distinct and do exist Even  our most advanced thinkers cannot persuade us that the distinction  between father and son brother and sister and mother and daughter  are mere figments of our deluded senses or the products of some deep rooted obsession fostered in our imaginations by a repressive cultural  order Once the facts regarding reproduction have been established it     226 Violence and the Sacred   is impossible to understand how they could ever have been misunder stood   It should now be apparent that the establishment of basic biological  facts requires the formal recognition of the three distinct relationships  marriage direct descent and consanguinitydefined by Radcliffe Brown and that this formal recognition is dependent on a real separa tionthat is it is based on incest prohibitions and kinship systems   Kinship systems then are essential to the ordering of biological data  There is no kinship system no matter how rigid and artificial that will  not serve this function As LeviStrauss has observed the common  basis of all kinship systems is the recognition of a firm distinction  between marriage and consanguinity   Although kinship systems vary greatly in scope their premises re main the same marriage is always forbidden between parents and chil dren and between brothers and sisters The exceptions to this pattern  are so rare and so special usually having to do with ritual that for all  practical purposes they can be regarded as exceptions that prove the  rule No matter how harsh and excessive certain marriage ordinances  may appear no matter how arbitrary and extreme their accompanying  prohibitions the reverse aspect of these rules may seem the basis of  the system remains stable and comprehensible Every kinship system  defines the licit and the illicit in sexual matters so as to exclude from  the reproductive process those sharing a parentchild or brothersister  relationship Therefore all those who submit to its governance are  obliged to acknowledge the basic facts of human reproduction   There is reason to believe that in the state of natural promiscuity the  connection between the sexual act and the birth of children or even  perhaps the very idea of conception would go unrecognized Only  through the establishment of incest prohibitions could man hope to  obtain the quasiexperimental conditions necessary to the recognition  of the reproductive process Only through incest prohibitions could  man introduce into his sexual life the stabilizing elements and sys tematic exclusions without which the relevant linkages and compari sons could not be made Prohibitions then serve as a necessary  controlling factor permitting man to recognize the results of sexual  activity through comparison with the sterility of abstinence   Of course it is impossible to reconstruct the historical chain of  events But that is not my concern here My sole purpose is to carry  the LeviStraussian critique of the nuclear family a little further than  LeviStrauss himself has chosen to do The three types of relationships  that constitute the nuclear family are the very ones that must be iso lated and made explicit in order to establish the basic biological prem ises and these relationships are in fact isolated and made explicit in all     LeviStrauss Structuralism and Marriage Laws 227   kinship systems The very concept of the nuclear family would be  inconceivable without kinship systems however it is always possible to  deduce this concept at least in theory from any imaginable kinship  system because the distinctions that define the concept are an integral  part of such systems It thus becomes clear that the nuclear family is  the product rather than the constituent of the kinship system and to a  far greater extent than ethnologists have hitherto suspected That is  why it is not sufficient to say that kinship systems even the most  complex and artificial of them take biological kinship into account  such systems are responsible for the discovery of biological kinship  and their existence conditions all understanding of it   In short the system itself has priority over the relationships it estab lishes If everything must be seen in connection with the system that is  because the system truly comes first even as regards biology and not  because the system could theoretically flout biological laws In fact the  system never flouts biology at least as long as it adheres to the strict  separation of marriage and consanguinity One must not think of the  system as stemming from its results for the system alone makes these  results possible The refusal to regard biology as a starting point is  made not because biology belongs in the realm of nature but because  on the contrary it belongs entirely to culture and is deduced from  systems of which the nuclear family is the smallest common denomi nator The system is all of a piece and must be viewed as such We  must take care not to be distracted by its multiple variations which in  no way affect its essence   The three types of relationship that compose the nuclear family all  have real biological counterparts yet they depend for their definition  on incest prohibitions In other words if there were no incest prohibi tions there would be no biological laws But the purpose of the system  is clearly not to uncover biological truths Such truths are not the only  ones set forth by the system they are only part of a vaster statement  For that reason they must not be taken as the point of departure   The proposition developed here takes no particular stand on the  controversial question Are there cultures that are ignorant of the biol ogy of human reproduction I would venture to say however that in  its handling of native testimony our theory can accomodate the skepti cal approach of contemporary researchers as well as the positive ap proach of their predecessors The possibility does indeed exist that  certain cultures despite incest prohibitions have never discovered the  connection between the sexual act and childbirth Such a theory has  been proposed by a number of ethnologists including Malinowski it is  based on long and intimate contact with native life and there is reason  to doubt whether the contemporary reaction against it is justified We     228 Violence and the Sacred   are asked to believe that these ethnologists were hoodwinked by their  informants who were simply pretending ignorance on the subject of  conception   This skeptical approach is ostensibly based on a new esteem for the  intellectual capacities of primitive man but it may well stem from yet  another and still more insidious form of ethnocentrism There is some thing vaguely demagogic about an appeal to common sense couched in  these terms Look here you surely dont believe that there are men so  stupid that they cant see the connection between sex and procreation  Its just cultural provincialism that makes us assume that sort of thing  whenever we encounter someone a bit different from ourselves   As I have already said the field of inquiry of this book does not  extend to this particular question nor would its answer affect my  argument I only wish to point out that modern attacks on the previous  generation of anthropologists are inspired by intellectual attitudes that  can only perpetuate an old tendency to remove basic biological truths  from the domain of culture and reattribute them to nature The appeal  to common sense the use of such daunting phraseology as it is self evident that   fits all too well with the misguided belief that kinship  systems take biological facts into account independently of their other  concerns More generally we encounter here a still mythic view of  nature one that sees nature as more receptive than culture to scientific  verities In fact there is no truth no matter how elementary that is not  mediated by culture The great book of Nature is an enigma one can  only approach obliquely    Q a  4 THE SIGNS OF HESITANCY and equivocation that  we detect in LeviStrausss efforts to situate a knowledge of true bio logical relationships within the framework of the kinship system  clearly stern from an inclination almost automatic today to exclude  scientific concepts from the company of myths rituals and kinship  systems We are less concerned here with the particular doctrine  which moreover displays certain inconsistencies set forth by Levi Strauss in the article cited above than with the implicit principles that  govern his thinkingand that are in fact almost universal supposi tions The object of our own search remains our intellectual attitude  toward the nuclear family which remains an obstacle even after Levi Strauss if we now treat our own privileged treatment of it as nothing  but an arbitrary prejudice   That kinship systems do not ignore or contradict biological kinship  but rather take them carefully into account is not selfevident to  presentday thinkers It is difficult to admit that our own knowledge of  the basic facts of biology issues from the same thought process that     LeviStrauss Structuralism and Marriage Laws 229   produced the most arbitrary and artificial distinctions of kinship sys tems Yet in both instances we have to do with the same type of  intellectual operation the same process of symbolic thought the gath ering of and distinguishing between entities whose union and separa tion are not made obvious in nature Nonetheless it is clear that all the  products of symbolic thought cannot be considered equivalent There  is such a thing as false symbolic thought for example the assumption  that childbirth is the result of a womans possession by spirits as well  as true symbolic thought for example the assumption that childbirth is  the result of the sexual union of man and woman   There is no thought that is not symbolic in the structuralist sense of  the word Nevertheless it is no more appropriate for us to employ the  term today as a synonym for false than it was appropriate in the past to  employ it as a synonym for true LeviStrauss was the first to empha size that all cultures contain an enormous store of knowledge that is  useful because it is grounded in the truth If this were not the case  these cultures would not have survived   Whatever their differences then kinship systems are such that they  cannot disregard the basic biological facts though in primitive cultures  these facts are somewhat lost in a maze of other distinctions   All these distinctions are of a piece that is they make up a system  Our tendency to grant prime consideration to biological matters lead  us to misunderstand the systematic aspect of the system To yield to  this tendency is to produce elements that do not adhere inexplicable  aberrations and exceptions that betray our inability to read the system  correctly The structuralists are surely right in urging their ethnologist  colleagues to check their compulsion to take biological facts as a point  of departure   Why has this compulsion become second nature to us Because our  own system corresponds exactly to that of the nuclear family It re duces the principle of exogamy to its simplest form and requires in  consequence only the minimum number of prohibitions necessary to  bring out the basic facts of generation   This coincidence must be kept in mind when we consider the basic  differences between our society and primitive societies Nowadays it is  often said that the concept of the modern family is just as arbitrary as  the assumptions of other kinship systems That is both true and false A  phenomenon can be arbitrary in relation to something and not arbi trary in relation to something else As far as the facts of procreation  are concerned it is true that our system is as arbitrary as any other  For as far as real biological functioning is concerned it scarcely mat ters whether a system forbids a man to marry either 1 his mother  his sisters his daughters and any of the women of tribe X or 2 his     230 Violence and the Sacred   mother his sisters and his daughters only The biological machinery  works neither better nor worse in the first case than in the second and  it might work just as well pace Westerrnarck if there were no re strictions whatsoever In regard to the true facts of generation then  the verdict is plain all kinship systems are equally arbitrary   Differences do exist however between the nuclear family system  and all other systems If it is true that all svstems have a certain didac tic value in regard to biological knowledge our system is certainly  preeminent in this regard There are no longer any prohibitions in it  that do not bring a basic relationship to light and there is no basic  biological relationship that is not revealed by a prohibition   This difference between our own and other systems may appear  slight Our extreme reduction of prohibitions may serve to underline  certain determined facts and bring them into sharper relief but it  discloses nothing that more complex systems could not also disclose  The biological example thus can suggest the relative singularity of our  own system but cannot demonstrate it   I began by emphasizing the biological question in order to dispose of  an important stumbling block at the outset namely the confusion  between fact and knowledge It was necessary to select the simplest  most accessible example by which to demonstrate the ability of sym bolic thought even at its most mythic to uncover scientifically signifi cant relationships and differencesan ability that would remain  unperceived by cultural relativism But biology is too rudimentary an  example to continue with Let us turn our attention to another realm  that of the cultural sciences and try to demonstrate that my approach  provides ethnology with a new and fertile field of activity   For LeviStrauss the language of kinship is a system of rules that  establishes a circuit of exchange between exogamic groups Each time a  group transfers one of its women to another group the beneficiary  group will respond by transferring one of its own women either to the  first group or to a third group depending on the requirements of the  system This response constitutes a new appeal which will be an swered accordingly The circle may be large or small but it always  closes itself The questions and responses emanating from the system  always follow the same order at least in principle Although this con stitutes a language in the structuralist sense it fails to meet Chomskys  criteria For him an essential trait is missing the infinite creativity of a  true language the constant potential for inventing new phrases and  expressing things never before expressed   Thus we should bear in mind that the language of kinship is incom plete and also that it is no longer spoken in certain societies most  particularly our own A system that restricts its prohibitions to a bare     LeviStrauss Structuralism and Marriage Laws 231   minimum as does ours suppresses all positive rules In other terms it  reduces the language of matrimonial exchange to nothing Wherever  modern society is found marriages are no longer confined to a deter mined matrimonial circuit That does not mean of course that ex ogamy has vanished Not only does it still exist but it manages to bring  together the most disparate groups even transcending the formidable  barriers of racial economic and national prejudice If sufficient infor mation were available we could evaluate the mediative role of such  cultural manifestations as clothing styles entertainment and so forth  in determining marriage alliances From the viewpoint of scientific  determinism exogamy is certainly a determined factor but it is no  longer determined by the mediation of socioreligious prescriptions to  which everyone can and must refer The factors influencing these  unions no longer possess a purely matrimonial significance Kinship no  longer possesses a language of its own And there is no code of conduct  telling people how to behave toward others and what behavior to  expect in return for expectations assume the form of statistics and no  longer apply to individual cases The linguistic metaphor must not be  allowed to distract us from these essential differences   Imperfect as it may be the assimilation of the system to a language is  a precious tool even in the case of primitive systems as long as we  remain within the framework of these systems It can help us to under stand the difference between all these systems and our own relative  lack of system As everyone knows the main obstacle to learning a  foreign language is ones mother tongue Our command of our native  idiom is probably less firm than its command of us and it displays a  certain jealous possessiveness by making it difficult for us to acquire  any other language Childrens capacity to assimilate languages depends  on their ability to forget And the greatest linguists often have no  tongue they can any longer call their own   The fact that we have eliminated the last vestiges of a matrimonial  language undoubtedly has something to do with our particular interest  in those who continue to speak such languages as well as with our  exceptional ability to decipher and classify them Our society can learn  to speak all the kinship languages because it speaks none of them Not  only do we read all those systems that actually exist but we even  invent those that do not We can produce an infinite number of sys tems because we have the matrix of all exogamic languages in our  grasp Between each of the systems and the system of systems between  the kinship languages and LeviStrausss own language in The Ele mentary Structures of Kinship the same differences exist as between  the traditional structuralist concept of language and Chomskys con cept     232 Violence and the Sacred   From this we can only conclude that our ethnological essence must  be in some way related to our vocations as ethnologists linguists and  more generally fieldworkers in the realm of culture Clearly our kin ship system alone is not responsible for our ethnological inclinations  rather the two phenomena are parallel The only society that has given  itself over to the pursuit of ethnological knowledge happens to be one  that has confined its system of prohibitions to the nuclear family We  cannot regard this fact as simple coincidence   In order to speak the language of scholarly research we must first lay  aside the language of rites and kinship passing through the intermedi ary dialects of cultural activities in their broadest sense One stage  follows the other without a break and at no point do the elements of  sacrificial misapprehension wholly disappear Nonetheless the ele ments of comprehension increase in number value and coherence   If ethnology is to become a true science it must reflect on its own  principles and that reflection must transcend the limits of ethnology to  take in the sort of society that produces ethnologistsalong with other  types of men such as romantic heroes In ethnological literature the  society that gives rise to ethnologists is always treated as it were in  parentheses The reasons for this treatment can be traced back to the  assumption that this society has nothing in common with primitive  societies Today when it is boldly asserted that our own society is  only one among many differing from other societies only in the way  that all societies differ this attitude has not vanished but has become  implicit rather than explicit This modern view is demonstrably false  And if we seek more from ethnology than a means by which to quell  the arrogance of our fellow Westerners we will have to face the fact  that our kinship system cannot be put on the same level as the systems  of aboriginal Australians or the CrowOmahas In our system there is  nothing arbitrary in the forms of knowledge to which we feel our selves bound We must not succumb to an antiethnocentrism which  because it diverts us from essentials has a somewhat sacrificial charac ter Antiethnocentrism is the final and parodoxical but ultimately logi cal maneuver of ethnocentrism itself    Q A 4 CONTEMPORARY THINKERS have drawn attention  to the largely arbitrary character of cultural systems Most of the  propositions that form these systems are neither true symbolic thought  or false symbolic thought in the sense of the two examples offered on  page 229 but generally belong to a third category they have no  reality oustide the cultures that give rise to them An example is the  proposition that crosscousins have a particular affinity for matrimony     LeviStrauss Structuralism and Marriage Laws 233   This body of arbitrary elements is the original sin of human  thought and it seems to increase as our skill in uncovering and inter preting these elements improves We cannot blame the researchers for  minimizing or even disregarding the elements of truth that lie hidden  amidst the arbitrary Symbolic thought in general is equated to  mythic thought and thus occupies a position some thinkers believe is  privileged but one that proves in the long run both deceptive and  unproductive for it has lost all link with reality The cultural heritage  of humanity is regarded with suspicion Its only interest lies in its  demystificarionthat is in providing the demystifier with a  chance to display his forensic skills   Humanity we are told has fallen victim to a vast mystification  unrecognized until now This is cultural nihilism and it is often associ ated with a fetishistic cult of science Because we have discovered the  original sin of human thought we think ourselves free of it What is  now needed is a radically different mode of thought a new science  that will allow us to appreciate the absurdity of all previous thinking  And because this lie was until recently immune from detection the  new scientific approach must be altogether unconnected with the past  Inevitably it will take the shape of a unique discovery by some in spired being who has little in common with ordinary mortals or even  with his own past In severing the cord that attached us to the matrix  of all mythic thought this liberator of humanity will have delivered us  from dark ancestral falsehood and led us into the luminous world of  truth Our hard and pure science is to be the result of a coupure  epistemologique an epistemological revolution that is totally unex pected and for which we are entirely unprepared   This scientific angelism springs from a deeprooted reluctance  philosophical and even religious in origin to admit that truth can  coexist with the arbitrary and perhaps even derive from it Certainly  such an idea runs counter to our habitual modes of thought And the  proposition that true thought and socalled mythic thought are one and  the same seems nothing short of scandalous Perhaps it is because there  are so few certain truths in the domain of culture that we are so eager  to have the origins clear easily understood and accessible to reason   The dualism of science and nonscience dates from the beginning of  the scientific era and has assumed a great variety of forms It grows  more acute when we approach a foreign culture and are unable to  grasp it It is undoubtedly what prompted LeviStrauss to express mild  astonishment that even the most artificial of kinship systems carefully  took into account biological facts In The Savage Mind LeviStrauss  attempted to formulate this dualism in highly attenuated and nuanced     234 Violence and the Sacred   form under the categories of savage thought and bricolage on  the one hand and the thought of the engineers on the other   We find in the work of LeviStrauss a strong tendency to relegate  truth either to the domain of natural thought or the domain of  engineering or else to a loosely defined combination of the two that  he designates as naturalist thought In his article on structural analy sis for instance LeviStrauss asserts that the study of kinship systems  obliges us to renounce naturalistic thoughtas if it were not sym bolic toonot because this mode of thought is intrinsically false but  because on the contrary it adheres too closely to the truth and is thus  incapable of taking into account the fantasies of symbolic thought  Structural ethnology thereby assumes a transitional and transitory  quality it is seen as a detour that uses savage thought against itself in  order to dissolve it to banish the hallucinations of our culture and  clear the way for the union of nature and science   All these questions converge on a fundamental question the origin  of symbolic thought And if symbolic systems are never the spon taneous development of an actual situation if there is a rupture  between nature and culture then the question becomes pressing Levi Strauss and the structuralists in general acknowledge this problem of  origins only in an abstract fashion The passage from nature to culture  they say is assured by the permanent traits of human nature the  problem is a false one falling outside the domain of science The  myths which falsely dramatize this passage by means of imaginary  catastrophes only serve to conceal its true nature Totem and Taboo is  seen in this view as another origin myth with little to offer beyond a  certain curiosity value The work should in short be treated like any  other myth   It might be well to return to the closing lines of Structural Analysis  in Linguistics and in Anthropology because of what they say and  fail to say about the viewpoints we are trying to assess here and also  because of the curious note of hesitancy they reveal Most untypically   6 The French term bricolage as employed here by LeviStrauss has no English  equivalent The best we can do is to refer to LeviStrausss own discussion of the  term in The Savage Mind Chicago 1966 There still exists among ourselves  an activity which on the technical plane gives us quite a good understanding of  what a science we prefer to call prior rather than primitive could have been  on the plane of speculation This is what is commonly called bricolage in  French In its old sense the verb bricoler applied to ball games and billiards to  hunting shooting and riding It was however always used with reference to some  extraneous movement a ball rebounding a dog straying or a horse swerving  from its direct course to avoid an obstacle And in our own time the bricoleur  is still someone who works with his hands and uses devious means compared with  those of a craftsman    It might be said that the engineer questions the universe  while the bricoleur addresses himself to a collection of oddments left over from  human endeavors that is only a subset of the culture pp 1617 19Trans     LeviStrauss Structuralism and Marriage Laws 235   the problem raised by the advent of symbolic thought is here viewed  as a real problem though we cannot be sure whether the problem has  already been resolved Although it may be legitimate or even inevita ble to fall back upon a naturalistic interpretation in order to understand  the emergence of symbolic thinking once the latter is given the na ture of the explanation must change as radically as the newly appeared  phenomenon differs from those which have preceded and prepared  it7   If symbolic thinking is a given is this because we grasp its emer gence or on the contrary because we do not Does its emergence pass  unnoticed Does it take the form of a silent mutation as many previ ous references either assert or imply or is it a real discernible event  The preceding passage seems to lean toward the second possibility  permitting us to view the symbolic advent as a legitimate and even  inevitable subject of inquiry But what are those phenomena that pre ceded and prepared this event How must we envision a line of  inquiry apparently committed to the naturalist interpretation   LeviStrauss is the first to raise the essential question even though he  does so indirectly and one might almost say inadvertently The reader  knows my response to the question My task now is to show or at least  to suggest that this is the only approach capable of exposing the de ficiency of a contemporary mode of thought that circles around the  problem of origins without ever coming to grips with itthat in fact  foregoes the opportunity to come to grips with it in favor of pure  formalism   The origin of symbolic thought lies in the mechanism of the surro gate victim such has been the burden of my argument particularly in  my analyses of the myths of Oedipus and Dionysus It is a fundamental  instance of arbitration that gives rise to the dual presence of the  arbitrary and the true in all symbolic systems   Collective murder restores calm in dramatic contrast to the hysteri cal paroxysms that preceded it The conditions favorable to thought  coincide with the death of the surrogate victim Mens minds turn back  to the miracle in order to perpetuate or renew it and in order to  accomplish this they need to reflect upon that miracle to rethink it  Myths rituals and kinship systems are the first fruits of this endeavor   To refer to the origin of symbolic thought is to speak as well of the  origin of language If the mechanism of the surrogate victim gives  birth to language and imposes itself as the first object of language it is  easy to see why language should first state the conjunction of best and  worst the divine epiphany the rite that commemorates this epiphany   7 Ibid p 51     23 6 Violence and the Sacred   and the myth that recalls it For a long time language remains imbued  with the sacred thus there is good reason why it should long appear as  a vassal of the sacred obedient to its every command   Cultural significations naturally include an arbitrary element for  they establish differences where formerly the symmetry of the doubles  prevailed and substitute the stability of fixed meanings for the ver tiginous alternation of violent reciprocity For example they relegate  plague to one category and patricide and incest to another The  machinery of discrimination plays us false as long as it applies itself to  those whom nothing distinguishes Indeed it must play us false in  order to work effectively in order to bring about the differentiated  unity of the whole community In the midst of a living culture men  are incapable of recognizing the arbitrary nature of the significations  produced by this mysterious mechanism   The processes of discrimination exclusion and conjunction are the  products of the generative process They are applied first to this same  process and this application gives rise to religious thought But they do  not confine themselves to religious thought alone they are the mech anism for all orders of thought And we cannot afford the luxury of  rejecting or even denigrating them for the truth is that they do their  work well When applied to something other than the original process  they bring to light veritable differences analyze real phenomena and  encompass data of a nonrelative varietyfor instance the data of  human generation It is not correct to say that these data have recently  become verifiable under modern laboratory conditions that have  transformed them into scientific truths They are scientific truths  today because they have always been scientific truths Basic discoveries  may result from bricolage   In the realm of religion to be sure error prevails But even here we  are not dealing with anything imaginary or gratuitous as the modern  rationalists arrogantly assume Primitive religion is not given over to  the phantoms fantasies and aberrant impulses that modern man thinks  he alone has discarded Rather and quite simply religion fails to grasp  the mechanism of the surrogate victim just as we still fail to grasp it  This perpetuation of the same error is what links our own thought to  primitive thought and what paradoxically compels us to regard the  latter as very different from our own even though the two modes of  thought are very similar This condescending attitude toward the  primitive is nothing more than an extension of a primitive attitude  that is an indefinite prolongation of misunderstanding of the role of  the surrogate victim   The generative process plays a major role in primitive culture but  passes unnoticed in ours This fact has dictated enormous changes in     LeviStrauss Structuralism and Marriage Laws 257   many aspects of our life and in our range of knowledge but it alters  nothing in regard to the basic misapprehension that continues to gov ern us and to shield us from our own violence and from awareness of  this violence It is this chronic primitivism that prompts us to dismiss as  mere illusion anything that draws our attention to the true state of  things and it is this same primitivism that prevents us from recogniz ing that falsehood in religious thought is something quite different  from mere error that falsehood has protected mankind from self destruction   iMen may be even more dependent on the surrogate victim than we  have indicated It is the surrogate victim who provides men with the  will to conquer reality and the weapons for all victorious intellectual  campaignshaving first secured society against violence The myths of  symbolic thought can be compared to a larvas cocoon without this  shelter no development could take place   To explain the preponderance of the arbitrary in primitive culture  we must understand that these societies are closer to the generative act  of arbitration than we are and we must realize that this proximity  informs every aspect of their historical reality We can envision this  original arbitrary7 act as overflowing its limits and engendering a super abundance of differences historical societies may well offer a weakened  image of this process when after a period of chaos and turmoil they  do a volteface and adopt a rigid hierarchic and highly compart mentalized mode of existence Without making too much of the anal ogy I might say that certain highly subdivided cultures confined to  the languages of ritual and kinship are closer both temporally and  temperamentally to the original impact of the generative violence than  are the more mobile and flexible societies whose systems of social  structure are less in evidence The omnipresent and inflexible differ ence may well assure stability but it will certainly discourage intel lectual speculation especially speculation regarding the origins of  culture   In order for men to make discoveries about their own culture codi fied rituals must give way to an agile mode of thinking that uses the  same mechanisms as religion with a virtuosity that religion never ap proached The cultural order itself must have begun to disintegrate  and the overflow of differences must have subsidednot so much  however as to provoke a new outbreak of violence which would in  turn generate new differences For reasons unknown to us primitive  societies never meet these conditions When the cycle of violence  begins it also comes to an end with such rapidity that the opportunity  for making major selfdiscoveries hardly exists   Modern Western society however can be described in terms of an     238 Violence and the Sacred   exceptionally farranging and drawnout critical cycle The very es sence of modern society might be said to be its ability to sustain the  possibility for new discoveries in the midst of an everworsening sacri ficial crisisnot to be sure without many signs of anxiety and stress  There is room for discovery in the natural sciences in the field of  cultural significations and finally on the specific subject of the arbi trary generative act   The extreme poverty of our kinship system in comparison with  those of primitive societies seems a sign of crisis in itself The Western  world is in a perpetual state of crisis and the crisis is alwfays spreading  As its ethnological basis falls away its specific nonspecificity becomes  more pronounced The Western world has always had a penchant for  anthropology And that penchant becomes more urgent as the situation  around us worsens   The present crisis affects all aspects of scholarship its polemical  characteristics as well as its rate of progress Our anthropological voca tion stems from the general nature of Western society and increases in  intensity to keep step with the crisis just so Oedipus investigation  kept pace with the accelerating rhythm of the tragic crisis The crisis  could determine as well the overall pattern of our researches and suc cessive discoveries and the order in which the theoretical premises  keep changing All scholarly priorities are historically determined  whether or not research in the strict sense is involved   Like all cultures our culture wears away from the periphery toward  the center The newly emerging social sciences exploit this deteriora tion in a rational systematic fashion The debris of the process serves  as the object of objective knowledge thus the positive regulations of  kinship as opposed to the prohibitions and more generally its sys tems of expression become in structural ethnology the object of posi tive knowledge   The essential characteristic of structuralism is that it puts the empha sis on positive regulations If the prohibition and the regulation con stitute two opposite poles of the same object there is good reason to  inquire which is the essential one LeviStrauss poses this very ques tion and resolves it in favor of the regulation Exogamy has a value  less negative than positive    It asserts the social value of other  people and    it prohibits endogamous marriage only in order to  introduce and to prescribe marriage with a group other than the  biological family certainly not because a biological danger is attached  to consanguineous marriage but because exogamous marriage results in  social benefit8   8 LeviStrauss The Elementary Structures of Kinship p 480     LeviStrauss Structuralism and Marriage Laws 239   We could easily cite fifteen or twenty such declarations all per fectly explicit which prove that LeviStrausss work far from display ing a passion for incest is remarkable for its dispassionate approach   They do not conceive of the prohibition as such ie in its negative  aspect the prohibition is merely the reverse or counterpart of a positive  obligation which alone is present and active in the consciousness      Marriage prohibitions    are prohibitions only secondarily and  derivatively Rather than a prohibition on a certain category of persons  they are a prescription directed towards another category In this regard  how much more penetrating is native theory than are so many modern  commentaries There is nothing in the sister mother or daughter which  disqualifies them as such Incest is socially absurd before it is morally  culpable   The prohibition of incest is less a rule prohibiting marriage with the  mother sister or daughter than a rule obliging the mother sister or  daughter to be given to others9   I have already broached the problem of priorities and adopted a  point of view diametrically opposed to that of LeviStrauss for me  prohibitions come first This perspective is necessitated by my overall  approach Positive exchanges are merely the reverse of prohibitions  the results of a series of maneuvers or avoidance taboos designed to  ward off outbreaks of rivalry among the males Terrified by the fearful  consequences of endogamous reciprocity men have created the bene ficial reciprocity of exogamic exchange It is only natural that in a  smoothly functioning system positive regulations should move to the  forefront as the awareness of danger grows dim At the outset how ever the matrimonial rules are like those perfectly choreographed ges tures unwittingly executed by characters in classic comedy and inspired  by sentiments wholly foreign to the dance such as jealousy or fear   LeviStrauss is undoubtedly correct to minimize the fascination for  incest as such insofar as it is a cultural phenomenon it constituted a  manifestation of the sacrificial crisis But this does not mean that pro hibitions do not come first If they did not it would be virtually  impossible to situate our own society within the universal ethnological  pattern   If rules are to be considered the cornerstone of a society then we  are faced with something of a problem in regard to our own society  which is deficient in positive regulations and has in fact discarded  everything except the basic exogamic prohibition The structuralists  hasten to assure us that there is nothing unique about our society Yet  in placing their emphasis on regulations they make it appear very  unique indeed Any attempt to minimize the singularity of our society   9 Ibid pp 485 481     240 Violence and the Sacred   only serves by a process of selfdenigration that still has its roots in  religion to raise it to the top once more If we wish to situate ourselves  in relation to other cultures we must refine the current view of our  ethnocentrism and resign ourselves to the relative uniqueness of our  society   Contemporary thought is in chaos as it must be when progress is  real Where it still survives it displays pathological symptoms  Thought in fact is caught up in a circle the very circle drawn for us  br Euripidean tragedy In striving to escape from the circle thought  only enters more deeply into it and as the radius of the circle shrinks  thought moves ever faster spinning itself into an obsession However  there is no such thing as an obsession pure and simple as the legion of  timorous antiintellectuals would have us believe and it is not by  breaking out of the circle that thought will ultimately free itself but  by penetrating to its very center while somehow managing to avoid  the pitfall of madness   Nothing now exists to interfere with a full revelation of violence  not even violence itself which men and its own extraordinary growth  have combined to deprive of that freedom of moment that formerly  assured the efficiency of the generative mechanism and the repression  of the truth The trap that the Western Oedipus has set for himself  will snap closed at the precise moment when the quest is finished for  trap and quest here again are one and the same thing   Today the reign of violence is made manifest It assumes the awe some and horrific form of technological weaponry These weapons as  the experts blandly inform us are what is keeping the whole world  more or less in line The idea of limitless violence long scorned by  sophisticated Westerners suddenly looms up before us Absolute ven geance formerly the prerogative of the gods now returns precisely  weighed and calibrated on the wings of science And it is this force  we are told that prevents the first planetary society the society that  already encompasses or will soon encompass the whole of humanity  from destroying itself   It seems increasingly clear that the pressure of violence or the insis tence of truth for whom man acts as a kind of torchbearer has  forced modern man to come face to face with this same violence or  truth For the first time he is confronted with a perfectly straight forward and even scientifically calculable choice between total de struction and the total renunciation of violence   It is something more than mere chance that has led to the coinci dence of these remarkable events linking the indubitably real progress  of the socalled human sciences with the slow but steady progress of     LeviStrauss Structuralism and Marriage Laws 241   knowledge toward an understanding of the surrogate victim and of the  violent origins of all human culture   4 ETHNOLOGICAL STRUCTURALISM works at un covering differences everywhere Superficially it might be said to be  the simple antithesis of an older ethnological approach that of Levy Bruhl which refused to see differences anywhere LevyBruhl thought  that he had located the primitive mind in certain aspects of myth  and religion and he postulated a permanent inability on the part of  primitive peoples the Australian aborigines for example to discern  differences He went so far as to suggest that these aborigines could  hardly distinguish between men and kangaroos The structuralists have  replied that as far as kangaroos are concerned the aborigines have a  thing or two to teach the ethnologists   It sometimes seems as if the variations of twentieth century7 ethnol ogy run parallel to the variations in esthetics and to intellectual fads in  general LevyBruhls primitive man lost in the mists of his mythic  stupor is succeeded by the structuralist chess player elaborating intri cate systems with imperturbable ease We are constantly shuttling  between these extremes which serve to create an illusion of change by  means of increasingly bizarre constructs but which in reality change  very little   LevyBruhl and the structuralists cannot be put on the same level  because differentiated structures have a definite autonomy a textual  reality that the sacred never possesses or possesses only in appearance  Structural analysis cannot deal with everything but within its limits it  is highly satisfactory   The sacred concerns itself above all with the destruction of differ ences and this nondifference cannot appear as such in the structure It  can only appear as we saw in Chapter 2 in the guise of a new and  somewhat equivocal kind of differencea double multiple monstrous  fantastic difference but one that is nonetheless meaningful In Myth ologiques monsters are ranked alongside tapirs and peccaries as if they  constituted real zoological species And in a sense they do For in  myths the role of violence in destroying and producing significations is  muted and disguised and those aspects of the myth that refer to its  own origins are woven into a tissue of enigmatic allusions Structural ism cannot penetrate this enigma because it deals only with differential  systems because strictly speaking only differential systems are di rectly observable   As long as meaning is healthy the sacred is absent It remains outside  the structure untouched by structural ethnology banished by struc    242 Violence and the Sacred   turalism In a sense this elimination of the sacred constitutes real  progress for it is finally accomplished in a thorough and systematic  manner And though accompanied by ideological prejudices it is not  dependent on them for its efficacy Structuralism constitutes a negative  but indispensable stage in the discovery of the sacred for it does away  with the confusion that has previously prevailed Thanks to structural ism it is possible to distinguish the finite quality of senseof structure  from the infinite quality of the sacred that inexhaustible reservoir  from which all differences flow and into which they all converge   We now know that the sacred reigns supreme wherever a cultural  order has not yet taken hold has only begun to take hold or has lost  its hold entirely The sacred also reigns over structure engenders  organizes observes and perpetuates it or on the contrary mishandles  dissolves transforms and on a whim destroys it But the sacred is not  actually present in structure in the sense that it is present everywhere  else   Structuralism makes this relationship clear but it is incapable of  expressing it directly for structuralism is itself locked into the struc ture a prisoner of the synchronic unable to perceive a change in terms  of violence or fear of violence Structuralism has its limits and it is  precisely these limits that make the disappearance of the sacred seem  natural to the structuralists Yet they can no more reply to the ques tion Where did the sacred disappear than they can reply to the  accusation of overemphasizing binary oppositions Their proper reply  to this latter charge should be that binary oppositions are predominant  because there are never more than two antagonists or two sides in any  conflict and as soon as a third adversary7 appears the two others either  join forces in opposing him or he elects to join one or the other side   To pass beyond the limits of structuralism we must first pause to  consider the doubtful significations those that imply both too little and  too much twins illnesses all forms of contaminations and contagions  inexplicable reversals of meaning unexpected growths and shrinkages  strange excrescences and deformations and all forms of the monstrous  and the bizarre Nor of course should we overlook sexual and other  transgressions acts of violence or behavior that is in any way excep tional especially when such behavior seems to be in defiance of an  explicit gesture of communal unanimity   The opening pages of LeviStrausss The Raiv and the Cooked seem  to abound in signs relating to mythic birth incest vengeance betrayal  by either a brother or brotherinlaw collective metamorphoses or  destructions as preambles to acts of foundation and creationand all  of them attributed to culture heroes whose antagonisms have somehow  been aroused     LeviStrauss Structuralism and Marriage Laws 243   In a Bororo myth the sun commands the inhabitants of a village to  cross a river by means of a footbridge which collapses under their  combined weight All the villagers perish with the exception of the  culture hero who could only walk slowly because his legs were de formed and therefore lagged behind the rest10 The hero brings the  drowned villagers back to life under different forms The hair of  those who were sucked into the whirlpools turned wavy or curly the  hair of those who drowned in calm waters was fine and smooth11   They return in separate groups and on a selective basis In a Tenete hara myth the culture hero Tupan is furious at learning that his  godchild had been mistreated by the relatives in whose care he had  placed the boy and he orders the child   to gather all the feathers he could find and to spread them around the  edge of the village Then Tupan set fire to the feathers and the entire  village was surrounded by walls of flame The inhabitants ran from side  to side but they were unable to escape Little by little their cries became  lower until they were transformed into the grunts of pigs at the same  time the people began to take on the form of peccaries and wild pigs A  few of them escaped into the dense forest and the wild pigs that inhabit  the forest today are their descendants Tupan made his godchild  Marana ywa the owner of the wild pigs12   In an interesting variant the culture hero puffed clouds of to bacco smoke into the interior The occupants became dizzy and  when the demiurge cried out to them Eat your food they thought  he was ordering them to copulate They proceeded to have coitus and  made the usual grunting sounds while doing so They were all changed  into wild pigs13   This passage offers a clear indication of the mystical role played  by tobacco and drugs in chamanistic and other practices Tobacco  contributes to the sense of dizziness induced by the sacrificial crisis  The reciprocal violence expressed by the inhabitants running from  side to side in the first version is reinforced by the sexual promiscuity  in the second the result of an explitit loss of significations   Although LeviStrauss if not referring specifically to a sacrificial  crisis he is clearly referring to the birth if not the rebirth of significa tions It is clear that the myths I am comparing all offer an original  solution to the problem of the changeover from continuous quantity  to discrete quantity14 Thus we are indeed dealing with significance  i Claude LeviStrauss The Raw and the Cooked trans John Weightman and

aspects of myth including its logic and meanings Vio lence is behind all mythic themes and only an understanding of its role  is capable of bestowing a coherence on these themes for without  sacrificing structure we can recover its lost origins and confer on  mvth an essential function   4 THE ANALYTICAL METHOD applied in previous  chapters to Greek tragedy has been primarily employed to decipher  the myths of which the tragedies themselves constitute the first efforts  at decipherment In concluding the present chapter I will try to show  that this method loses none of its validity when applied outside the  realm of Greek tragedy and mythology   Because the last two chapters have been largely devoted to incest  prohibitions and marriage regulations it might be interesting to exam ine a myth that attributes the same origin to both of them and lends  support to our theory as a whole The myth in question comes from  the Tsimshian Indians who inhabit the Pacific coast of Canada15   A chieftains son falls in love with the daughter of his mothers  brotherthat is his crosscousin The girl out of sheer perversity  demands that the young man prove his love by disfiguring himself  The young man therefore scars first his left cheek then his right and  the girl horrified by his ugliness banishes him from her sight The  brokenhearted young man flees the country intent only on death  Finally he arrives in the land of Chief Pestilence Master of Deformi ties A crowd of tribesmen surround their leader all of them mutilated  and crippled They are dangerous for anyone who responds to their  advances comes to resemble them The young man is careful to ignore  them and the chief agrees to restore his features in fact to make him  handsomer than before The young man is boiled in a magic pot from  which the chiefs daughter extracts his stripped and whitened bones  He is then brought back to life resplendent with beauty   Now it is the girls turn to fall in love with her cousin and her  cousins turn to demand the same proof of love she had asked of him   13 Franz Boas Tsimshian Mythology Report of the Bureau of American  Ethnology 31 185 No 25 See also Stith

by the  young man Frantic to have her lost beauty restored she too repairs to  the court of Chief Pestilence but unlike the young man she accepts  the tribesmens invitation to join them Thereupon they make the un fortunate young woman one of their own crippling and mutilating her  and then casting her out to die   The reader will have recognized in this tale a number of familiar  themes All the people in the myth either disfigure others demand that  others disfigure themselves try in vain to disfigure others or actually  disfigure themselvesall of which amounts ultimately to the same  thing One cannot exert violence without submitting to it that is the  law of reciprocity Everybody in the myth comes to resemble every body else The danger threatening newcomers at the hands of Chief  Pestilences tribesmen is in fact visited by both cousins on each other  Pestilence and mutilation signify one and the same reality the sacrifi cial crisis   In the relationship between the two cousins the woman initially has  the upper hand She incarnates beauty the man ugliness she is free of  desire while he is caught in its thrall The relationship is then reversed  Differences cancel each other out a symmetry is constantly generated  invisible in each synchronic moment taken separately but visible in the  accumulation of successive moments This is what constitutes the non difference of the sacrificial crisis a truth forever inaccessible to the  two partners who live out the relationship in the form of alternating  differences The symmetry of the overall picture is reflected in the two  sides of the face each scarred in turn The same details are reiterated  throughout the story until the conclusion but never simultaneously   Between the two cousins and Chief Pestilences tribesmen there is  the same relationship as that between the protagonists of Oedipus the  King and the Theban plague victims The only way to avoid contagion  is to turn a deaf ear to the appeals of the enemy brothers On the level  of the tribesmenthat is the collectivitythe myth speaks objec tively It does what we ourselves did in our opening chapters it short circuits the alternating differences It does so with good reason for  this difference only ends in similarity The reciprocal mutilation takes  the direct form of a loss of differences a becoming the same at the  hands of those whom violence has already made identical When we  note that this process consists of turning men into doubles as well as  into monsters it is clear that we are dealing here with a sacrificial crisis   Mutilation symbolizes the working of the crisis in dramatic fashion  Clearly it must be viewed both as the creation of fearfully deformed  beings and as the elimination of all distinguishing characteristics all the     246 Violence and the Sacred   salient features of these beings The process imposes uniformity and  eliminates differences but it never succeeds in establishing harmony  In the image of monstrous mutilation the procedures of reciprocal  violence are expressed in such powerfully condensed form that they  appear bizarre indecipherable and mythic   LeviStrauss mentions this Tsimshian myth in one of his essays he  calls it a horrific little fiction16 We prefer to describe it as a re markable fiction about the horrific human relationships occasioned by  reciprocal violence In any case the term fiction is hardly worth  retaining Although the myth itself is foreign to our Western mode of  thought the relationship between the cousins introduces an element  that our classic theater traditionally treats in terms of tragic conflict or  comic misunderstanding and that also bears a striking resemblance to  the sentiment of lovejealousy found in the novels of Stendhal Proust  and Dostoevsky   The prince and princess claim and obtain from each other the same  violent loss of difference that Chief Pestilences tribesmen inflict on  those who are mad enough to join their ranks All differences dissolve  and disappear yet in a sense they remain inviolate and whole We are  never told in the myth that the differences between the tribesmen and  the two cousins and more importantly between the two cousins them selves have been eliminated and the destruction of the symmetry  between the cousins at the conclusion forcefully affirms the primacy of  differences   There is nothing in the relationship between the cousins to justify  this loss of symmetry except for the fact that the Indian girl like  Oedipus initiated the whole action This identifying of the origin with  an instance of impure violence is not wholly satisfactory Once again  we find ourselves confronted by the basic contradiction that underlies  Oedipus the King and The Bacchae While the course of the relation ships reveal a constant erosion of all the differences and while the  mythic action tends toward the perfect symmetry of the undifferen tiated relationships the outcome of the myth arbitrarily reverses the  process The asymmetry of the message is here again in direct contrast  to the burgeoning symmetry apparent on every other level Everything  leads us to suspect that this contradiction must be linked to a specific  event that lies buried in the myths conclusionthe murder of the girl  who to all appearances performs the role of surrogate victim Once  again the unanimityminusone of collective violence recreates mythic  differences which are themselves the issues of a violent undifferentia tion taking place throughout the narrative   16 Claude LeviStrauss La

Pestilences tribesmen resembles the violence that preceded it in  every way but one its finality The act serves definitively to stabilize a  difference that otherwise would have continued to alternate between  the two protagonists It is the whole mob of tribesmen the whole  community which falls upon the girl and tears her limb for limb with  their naked hands Once again we recognize a Dionysiac sparagmos  And once again we recognize the generative because unanimous act  of mob murder   The return to differentiated harmony is based on the arbitrary ex pulsion of the surrogate victim The metamorphosis of the chieftains  son is also based on this generative violence even though it happens to  precede it in the mythic sequence and is integrated in part to the  reciprocal interplay It is the other face of the generative violence the  return to beneficence following the paroxysm of malevolence That is  why this metamorphosis also abounds in elements that designate and  disguise the mechanism of the surrogate victim The strange technique  of the happy metamorphosis resembles a shamanistic initiatory dream  of which there are many examples in American Indian folklore  dreams about dead men who are revived when their body or bones  have been trampled on17 This technique can perhaps be compared to  a sacrificial practice referred to earlier see p 100 in which the  crowd stamps on the victim himself or on his burial place It should  also be noted however that the final metamorphosis occurs with  stripped and whitened bonesthat is with human remains that are free  from all taint of corruption or decay The metamorphosis of the chief tains son thus constitutes a return from the dead It is the happy result  of an act of supreme violence perpetrated by restored unanimity The  reconquest of beauty coincides with the renovation of the cultural  order And Chief Pestilence himself incarnates all the successive aspects  of violence master of deformities and metamorphoses sole arbiter of  the ultimate game he plays the same role as Dionysus in The Bacchae   AH the significant differentiations of the myththe difference be tween the protagonists and Chief Pestilences tribesmen then the  sexual difference between the protagonists together with the fact that  they are crosscousinsall these can be traced back to the act of gen erative violence The mythic action the process of violent undifferen tiation cannot fail to upset the norm established at the myths outset  the difference which is now normative as well as significant enjoining  these two crosscousins of different sex to marry An unstable combi nation of undifferentiation and difference the myth is inevitably pre  17 Cf Thompson ed Tales of the North American Indians Bloomington  1968 p 261 n I     248 Violence and the Sacred   sented in terms of the violation of a rule established by itself This is  the way it was originally told to Franz Boas by his native informant  Ever since the girl in the myth met her unhappy fate he was told  young girls have been married off to their cousins regardless of their  personal preferences   It is interesting to compare our myth with the rites performed at the  marriage of crosscousins of a princely family of the Tsimshian people  When the prince and the princess have been joined together the  tribesmen of the young mans uncle begin to shake then the tribesmen  of the girls uncle begin to shake and a combat breaks out between the  two groups Stones are thrown and many heads are battered The scars  and wounds serve as proof of the wedding contract18   Up to this point the presence of the sacrificial crisis behind the myth  was only a hypothesis prompted by the belief that the mutilation  image was based on a real occurrence The matrimonial myth confirms  this hypothesis by incorporating the violence in question ritual vio lence to be sure but perfectly real and clearly linked to the theme of  mutilation in the myth Stones are thrown and man heads battered  It is easy to imagine a twentiethcentury Cervantes or Moliere planting  in the midst of those flying stones a devotee of the selfreferential text  in order to prove to him that some metaphors are more striking than  others The Indians had no doubts on this subject The scars and  wounds    serve as proof of the wedding contract The sacrificial  nature of this violence is further confirmed bv an additional fact com municated to Boas by another native informant Among the Niquas  whose marriage customs are similar to those of the Tsimshians the  battle betwen the two groups can reach such a pitch of intensity that  one of the slaves on the fiances side is killed The sacrificial aspect of  this action is implicit but obvious It is known in advance to what side  the victim will belong and that he will be a slave and not a free  manthat is somebody wholly apart from the community whose  death will not risk unleashing a real crisis Although foreseen the death  retains a problematical quality that recalls the unforeseeable advent of  the surrogate victim for a man is not killed on every such occasion  When a man is killed his death is looked upon as a good omen a sign  that the couple will never separate   The diverse mutilations described in the Tsimshian myth and ritual  will undoubtedly prompt the psychoanalytically inclined to see the  whole affair in terms of castration The loss of difference is a more  comprehensive interpretation The theme of violent undifferentdation   18 Boas Tsimshian Mythology     LeviStrauss Structuralism and Marriage Laws 249   includes that of castration whereas the castration theme cannot pos sibly include all the elements covered by violent undifferentiation   Ritual violence is intended to reproduce an original act of violence  There is nothing mythic about this original violence but its ritual imita tion necessarily includes mythic elements The original violence cer tainly did not bring into conflict two such neatly differentiated groups  as those of the two uncles It can be stated as a principle that violence  precedes either the division of an original group into twTo exogamous  moieties or the association of two groups of strangers gathered to gether to effect matrimonial exchanges The original violence took  place within a single solitary group which the mechanism of the  surrogate victim compelled either to split in separate groups or to seek  an association with other groups Ritual violence invariably takes place  between already constituted groups   Ritual violence is always less internal than the original violence In  assuming a mythicoritual character violence tends toward the ex terior and this tendency in turn assumes certain sacrificial characteris tics it conceals the site of the original violence thereby shielding from  this violence and from the very knowledge of this violence the ele mentary group whose very survival depends on the absolute tri umph of peace The ritual violence that accompanies the exchange of  women serves a sacrificial purpose for each group In sum the groups  agree never to be completely at peace so that their members may find  it easier to be at peace among themselves We see here the principle  behind all foreign wars aggressive tendencies that are potentially  fatal to the cohesion of the group are redirected from within the  community to outside it Inversely there is reason to believe that the  wars described as foreign wars in the mythic narratives were in fact  formerly civil strifes There are many tales that tell of two warring  cities or nations in principle independent of one anotherThebes and  Argos Rome and Alba Hellas and Troywhose conflicts bring to the  surface so many elements pertaining directly to the sacrificial crisis and  to its violent resolution that it is hard not to view these stories as  mythic elaborations of this same crisis presented in terms of a Active  foreign threat     l Chapter Ten   The Gods the Dead the Sacred  and Sacrificial Substitution   e   3  l  EVERY GOD HERO AND MYTHIC CREATURE       so far encountered from the sacred African king to Chief   Pestilence of the Tsimshians embodies the interplay of violence pro jected by an act of generative unanimity   Oedipus our first example seemed at the outset of his career to  incarnate an almost exclusively maleficent form of violence It was  only later in Oedipus at Colonus that he assumed an actively benefi cent role As we know unanimous violence is generative of a religious  order and the man charged with the crime of patricide and incest is  credited with the act of generation Thus Oedipuss transformation  into an object of public reverence is not hard to understand   The two Oedipus tragedies permit us to study in isolation two  conflicting and successive moments of the heros sacralization In The  Bacchae as we have observed these same two moments serve to define  the dual personality of Dionysus his beneficent and maleficent aspects  In the Euripidean drama the moments are so telescoped and juxtaposed  that it would be almost impossible to recognize their point of origin or  appreciate their historical development if we did not have Sophocles  Oedipus plays to guide us The religious formulation of the Oedipus  myth is considerably easier to grasp because it is less transmuted more  directly based on the mechanism of the surrogate victim   In The Bacchae Dionysus plays the role not of victim but of  executioner This difference which may at first seem crucial is in fact  of no consequence for the religious implications of the work As we  have already remarked the mythic or divine creature who appears as  the incarnation of violence is not restricted to the role of surrogate  victim The metamorphosis of the maleficent into the beneficent is the  major aspect of his mission the aspect that elicits public veneration  but he is equally capable of effecting the reverse transformation He  can intervene at any stage and assume all roles either simultaneously or  in succession Thus there are moments in Dionysus career when he   250     Sacrificial Substitution 251   relinquishes the role of executioner to assume that of victim of the  diasparagmos In one episode of his myth for instance he is torn limb  for limb by a raging mob of Titans a mythic creature Zagreus or  Dionysus is sacrificed by other mythic creatures The burden of the  story is identical to that of the origin myths referred to earlier   We have seen that in the course of the Incwala rites the King of the  Swazi becomes simultaneously executioner and victim Similarly the  Aztec god XipeTotec demonstrates the ability of the incarnation of  the sacred to assume different roles within the system Sometimes this  god is killed and flayed in the person of a victim offered as substitute  for him at other times the god becomes the executioner flaying vic tims in order to don their skin Evidently religious thought perceives  all those who participate in this violent interplay whether actively or  passively as doubles XipeTotec can be translated our flayed lord  and mastera name that suggests that the basic role remains that of  surrogate victim   The theory of a violence that is sometimes reciprocal sometimes  unanimous and generative is the first truly to take into account the  double nature of all primitive divinities the blending of beneficent and  maleficent that characterizes all mythical figures who involve them selves in mortal affairs Dionysus is at one and the same time the most  terrible and the most gentle of the gods There is a Zeus who hurls  thunderbolts and a Zeus as sweet as honey In fact there is no  ancient divinity who does not have a double face If the Roman Janus  turns to his worshippers a countenance alternately warlike and peace ful that is because he too reflects the same alternation and if he comes  in time to symbolize foreign war that is because foreign war is merely  another form of sacrificial violence   If we understand the interplay of violence in primitive societies the  origins and structure of all mythical and supernatural beings becomes  clear As we have seen the surrogate victim meets his death in the  guise of the monstrous double All sacred creatures partake of  monstrosity whether overtly or covertly this aspect of their nature  can be traced to the monstrous double The marriage of beneficent and  maleficent constitutes of course the original and fundamental mon strosity the superhuman creatures absorption of the difference be tween good and bad difference that basic difference that dominates  all others   There is no essential difference between the monstrous aspects of  Oedipus and the monstrous aspects of Dionysus Dionysus is simul taneously god man and bull Oedipus is simultaneously son husband  father and brother of the same human beings Both have incorporated  into themselves differences normally considered irreconcilable Reli    252 Violence and the Sacred   gious thinking puts all differences at the same level it assimilates fam ily and cultural differences to natural differences When we are dealing  with mythology therefore we must make do without any clear dis tinction between physical monstrosity and moral monstrosity Reli gious thought makes no distinction between biological twins and twins  of violence engendered by the disintegration of the cultural order   All the episodes of the Oedipus myth are repetitions of one another  Once we recognize this fact it becomes apparent that all the figures in  the various episodes are monsters and that their resemblance is far  closer than appearance alone might suggest Oedipus naturally is a  monster but Tiresias is a monster too as a hermaphrodite he incor porates the difference between the two sexes The sphinx is a monster  a veritable conglomerate of differences with its womans head lions  body serpents tail and eagles wings On first glance there is a radical  difference between this imaginary creature and the human protag onists but this difference vanishes on closer inspection The sphinx plays the same role in relation to Oedipus as do all the human figures  The sphinx bars Oedipuss way it becomes an object of fascination  and a secret model it is the bearer of the logos phobon the oracle of  doom Like Laius like the drunken Corinthian earlier in the story and  Creon and Tiresias later the sphinx dogs Oedipuss trackswhenever  that is Oedipus is not dogging the sphinxs tracks Like the others the  sphinx catches Oedipus in an oracular trap in short the episode of the  sphinx recapitulates the other episodes The sphinx appears as the in carnation of maleficent violence as Oedipus himself will appear later  on The sphinx has been sent by Hera to punish Thebes just as the  plague is visited upon the city by order of Apollo Like the plague the  sphinxs appetite for victims increases steadily until it is vanquished by  Oedipus who thereby restores the city The episode of the sphinx  shows Oedipus in the role of monsterkiller or executioner Later a  monster himself he will assume the role of surrogate victim Like all  incarnations of sacred violence Oedipus can and does play every part  in succession   The sacred king is also a monster He is simultaneously god man  and savage beast Royal titles like the Lion or the Leopard may  degenerate into mere formulas but they have their origin in memories  of the monstrous double and generative unanimity Moral and physical  monstrosity are thus blended and confused Like Oedipus the king is  at once stranger and son the most intimate of insiders and the most  bizarre of outsiders he is an exemplar of enormous tenderness and  frightful savagery As an incestuous criminal he stands above and be yond all the rules he promulgates and enforces He is the wisest and  the most lunatic the blindest and the most lucid of men This monop    Sacrificial Substitution 253   olizing of differences which makes of the king a sacred monster in  every possible sense of the term finds vivid expression in ritual chants   The chieftain is neither this nor that  The chieftain is neither good nor bad  He is at once guest foreigner and host villager  He is the wise man and the fool1   It should be no cause for surprise then that the august inhabitants  of Olympus have been charged with a fair number of rapes murders  parricides and incestuous acts as well as innumerable incidents of  savagery and madness Nor should we be surprised to discover that  these divine personages seem to be made up of bits and pieces taken  from every order of realityhuman animal inorganic cosmic Noth ing is more futile than to seek stable distinctions among these monsters  unless it is the attempt to derive psychological insights from their  stories insights pertaining either to individuals or to the collective  consciousness Of all learned pursuits undertaken in the course of  Western history that one is surely the most foolhardy The pseudo rational treatment of monsters the classification of monster stories into  archetypes can only serve as a humorless revision of Ovids subtle  and exhaustive Metamorphoses it can only serve further to elaborate  the mythological process To pontificate on the subject of monsters is  in effect to take them seriously to enter into their game it is to be  duped by their appearance instead of recognizing the human being  who lurks behind the monstrous form   The variations among various types of mythological creatures only  become interesting if we relate these variations to their common origin  in generative violence We then realize that the differences reside not  in the objects themselves but in the indeterminate nature of the hal lucinated differentiation they embody an differentiation that is  made determinate retrospectively by the generative violence   Some religious differences clearly reflect the violence that engen dered them the ritual incest of the African monarchs for instance or  such sacrificial practices as the Dionysiac sparagmos In many mytholo gies the gods spirits or mythic creatures are divided into two distinct  camps one of serious and one of comic personalities The Greek  Hermes and the Roman Mercury are examples of comic gods Some  societies harbor sacred clowns or fools The North Americans have  their tricksters1 there are royal fools and kings of fools and any  number of temporary sovereigns both comic and tragic who are  ceremonially sacrificed at the predetermined end of their brief reign  These figures are incarnations of sacred violence as surely as the Afri  1 Theuws Naitre et mourir dans le rituel Luba p 172     254 Violence and the Sacred   can king but on a somewhat different level In each case we are dealing  with collective violence and more specifically with a certain mode of  collective violence In addition to the serious expulsion there must  always have been an act of expulsion based at least in part on ridicule  In the modern world our everyday much diluted forms of social  ostracism are generally based on ridicule much of contemporary liter ature is explicitly or implicitly concerned with this phenomenon We  need only think of those social categories and individuals that provide  the victims in scapegoat ritesvagabonds beggars cripplesto recog nize that derision of one form or another plays a large part in the  negative feelings that find expression in the course of the ritual sacri fice and that are finally purified and purged by it   We have here a body of material that calls out for detailed analysis  But because the relevance of this material to my general thesis presents  at least in principle no real problem let us pass on to other forms of  religion and consider how they can fit my scheme Let us turn first to a  religious practice that may appear very different from those previously  examined but one that is in actuality closely related ancestor worship  or more simply the worship of the dead   In certain cultures the gods are either absent or insignificant In such  cases mythic ancestors or the dead take the place of the missing  divinities and are seen as the founders guardians and if need be dis rupters of the cultural order When incest adultery and other social  ills begin to proliferate when family relationships begin to crumble  the dead are displeased and visit their displeasure on the living They  bring nightmares madness contagious diseases they provoke discord  among relatives and neighbors and instigate all sorts of perversions   The crisis assumes the form of a loss of difference between the living  and the dead a casting down of all barriers between two normally  separate realms We have here the proof that the dead incarnate vio lence exterior and transcendent violence when order reigns immanent  violence when things turn bad and maleficent reciprocity walks  abroad The dead do not want the total destruction of an order that is  after all basically their own After they have brought about a  paroxysm of sorts in the community they are willing once more to  accept the homage of their descendants they cease to haunt the living  and withdraw to their usual retreats If they do not go into exile of their  own accord they allow themselves to be led into exile by the com munitys ritual observances The difference between the living and the  dead is thereby restored   This troubling confusion between living and dead is sometimes re garded as the consequence of the crisis and sometimes as its cause The  punishments that the dead inflict upon the living are indistinguishable     Sacrificial Substitution 255   from the consequences of wrongdoing In a small community hubris  spreads rapidly with as we know dire results Thus the vengeance of  the dead like the vengeance of the gods is both real and implacable It  is in fact violences own revenge on those who wield it   In this instance the dead have clearly replaced the gods and the  beliefs relating to the dead lead us back to our discussion of Oedipus  Dionysus and the rest Yet a question remains How can the dead  incarnate violence as authoritatively as do the gods   Death is the ultimate violence that can be inflicted on a living being  It is therefore the extreme of maleficence With death a contagious  sort of violence is let loose on the community and the living must take  steps to protect themselves against it So they quarantine death creat ing a cordon sanitaire all around it Above all they have recourse to  funeral rites which like all other rites are dedicated to the purgation  and expulsion of maleficent violence   Whatever the cause and circumstances of his death the dying man  finds himself in a situation similar to that of the surrogate victim visa vis the community The grief of the mourner is a curious mixture of  terror and hopea mixture conducive to resolutions of good conduct  in the future The death of the individual has something of the quality  of a tribute levied for the continued existence of the collectivity A  human being dies and the solidarity of the survivors is enhanced by his  death   The surrogate victim dies so that the entire community threatened  by the same fate can be reborn in a new or renewed cultural order  Having sown the seeds of death the god ancestor or mythic hero  then dies himself or selects a victim to die in his stead In so doing he  bestows a new life on men Understanding this process we can also  understand why death should be regarded as the elder sister not to say  the mother and ultimate source of life itself   Belief in a union between life and death has long been ascribed to the  cycle of the seasons the annual rebirths and deaths in the plant king dom Such a theory simply involves heaping one myth on top of an other it refuses to acknowledge the violence that permeates all human  relationships The theme of death and resurrection flourishes in regions  where seasonal change is nonexistent or very slight And even wrhere  analogies do exist or when the religious imagination has put them to  use we are not justified in regarding nature as the source of this belief  The periodicity of the seasons serves as a rhythmic accompaniment to  the changes that occur in human relationships and have as their pivot  the death of a sacrificial victim   Death then contains the germ of life There is no life on the com munal level that does not originate in death Death can appear as the     256 Violence and the Sacred   true godhead the confluence of the most beneficent and most malefi cent forms of violence This mav well have been what Heraclitus  meant when he declared Dionysus and Hades are the same Surely  he is not merely making reference to Dionysus anecdotal link to the  Underworld but rather is directing attention to death community  harmony and the genesis of the gods   A duality of good and bad may be found even in the material  aspects of death As long as the process of decomposition takes its  course the cadaver is an impure element Like the violent disintegra tion of a society the physiological decomposition of the corpse leads  gradually from a very complex system of differentials to undifferen tiated dust The forms of the living revert to formlessness And lan guage itself falters in describing the remains The rotting corpse  becomes in the words of Bossuet cet objet qui na de nom dans  aucune langue   However once the process has been completed and the terrible  dynamism of decomposition is over the impure status of the nameless  object is generally terminated as well In certain societies the dry and  whitened bones of the deceased are thought to possess beneficial prop erties to be conducive to fertility2   Every death tends to become ritualized after the model of the gen erative expulsion to make allusion to the underlying mystery of  violence In return the generative expulsion may be memorialized in  the form of death This is precisely what takes place when the dead  exercise functions that are elsewhere the prerogative of the gods All  aspects of violence are assimilated to an individual ancestor or to the  entire legion of the dead The monstrous character of the original  ancestor the fact that he is frequently the incarnation of an animal  can be seen as proof that the monstrous double still holds sway at the  origin of the cult The worship of the dead like the worship of the  gods represents an interpretation of the role of violence in the destiny  of a community In fact it is the most transparent of all such interpre tations the closest to what actually occurred the first timeexcept of  course that it has misconstrued as always the mechanism of recovered  unanimity This interpretation states explicitly that the origin of any  cultural order involves a human death and that the decisive death is  that of a member of the community   4ft4 l B E G A N B Y TRACING the course of violence  through those beings who appear to incarnate it mythic heroes sacred  kings gods and deified ancestors Those various incarnations enrich   2 See Chapter 9 p 247     Sacrificial Substitution 257   our understanding of the many roles of violence and clarify the func tion of the surrogate victim and the preeminent importance of violent  unanimity   These incarnations are invariably illusory in one sense Violence  belongs to all men and thus to none in particular All the actors have  the same role with the exception of the surrogate victim But anybody  can play the part of surrogate victim It is futile to look for the secret  of the redemptive process in distinctions between the surrogate victim  and the other members of the community The crucial fact is that the  choice of the victim is arbitrary The religious interpretations we have  considered so far are at fault precisely because they attribute the bene ficial results of the sacrifice to the superhuman nature of the victim or  of the other participants insofar as any of these appears to incarnate  the supreme violence   In addition to such personalized interpretations there is an imper sonal approach It corresponds to the full range of the term sacred or  rather of the Latin sacer which is sometimes translated sacred  sometimes accursed for it encompasses the maleficent as well as the  beneficent Analogous words can be found in many languages the  famous mana of the Melanesians for example or the ivakan of the Sioux  and the orenda of the Iroquois   In one respect at least the structure of the sacer is the least deceptive  the least mythic of all it postulates no single master of ceremonies no  intervention by a privileged party even a superhuman one The fact  that the sacer can be understood in terms that require no anthropo morphic presence demonstrates that religion should not be defined as  animism or anthropomorphism If religion consisted of humanizing  the nonhuman or bestowing souls wherever they were felt to be  lacking an impersonal apprehension of the sacred would not be pos sible   My effort to group all the subjects considered in this study under a  general heading has resulted in the tide Violence and the Sacred This  impersonal designation is fundamental to our discussion In Africa as  in many other parts of the world there is only a single term to denote  the two faces of the sacredthe interplay of order and disorder of  difference lost and retrieved as enacted in the immutable drama of the  sacrifice of the incestuous king This term serves to describe all the  royal transgressions all forbidden as well as all permitted sexual prac tices all forms of violence and brutality unclean things decaying  matter monstrosities disputes between relatives and neighbors out bursts of spite envy and jealousy In addition the same term embraces  the creative impulse and the urge for order for peace calm and stabil ity All these varied significations appear under the aegis of royalty     258 Violence and the Sacred   Royalty is an incarnation of the sacred But these same manifestations  of the sacred can also exist apart from royalty we must have recourse  to the sacred in order to understand the institution of royalty but the  reverse does not hold true   Sacrifice too can be defined solely in terms of the sacred without  reference to any particular divinity that is it can be defined in terms  of maleficent violence polarized by the victim and metamorphosed by  his death or expulsion from the community which amounts to the  same thing into beneficent violence Although the sacred is bad  when it is inside the community it is good when it returns to the  exterior The language of pure sacredness retains whatever is most  fundamental to myth and religion it detaches violence from man to  make it a separate impersonal entity a sort of fluid substance that  flows everywhere and impregnates on contact The concept of con tagion is obviously a byproduct of this way of envisaging the sacred  As a concept contagion makes empirical sense in many cases but it is  mythic insofar as it ignores the reciprocal aspect of violence it literally  reifies the violence mat is active in human relationships by transform ing it into a pseudosubstance Though generally less mythic than the  language of divinity the language of pure sacredness is more mythic in  that it eliminates the final traces of the real victims thereby concealing  the fact that the sacred cannot function without surrogate victims   I have used the phrase violence and the sacred I might as well have  said violence or the sacred For the operations of violence and the  sacred are ultimately the same process Although ethnologists are gen erally disposed to acknowledge that violence exists at the heart of the  sacred they also hasten to add that the sacred includes another more  important and directly contradictory element The sacred as they see  it involves order as well as disorder peace as well as war creation as  well as destruction In fact the sacred seems so heterogeneous that the  specialists have despaired of ever sorting it out Yet the theory of  generative violence permits us to define the sacred in simple concrete  terms that emphasize its underlying unity without overlooking its  complexity it enables us to bring together all the disparate elements of  the sacred into an intelligible whole   Once we have recognized the role of generative violence it becomes  clear why the sacred is able to include within itself so many opposites  Sometimes it rallies the whole community around itself in order to  save mankind and restore culture sometimes it seems intent on de stroying its own creations Men do not worship violence as such Prim itive religion is no cult of violence in the contemporary sense of the  phrase Violence is venerated insofar as it offers men what little peace  they can ever expect Nonviolence appears as the gratuitous gift of     Sacrificial Substitution 259   violence and there is some truth in this equation for men are only  capable of reconciling their differences at the expense of a third party  The best men can hope for in their quest for nonviolence is the  unanimitvminusone of the surrogate victim   If primitive religious thought is mistaken in deifying violence it is  correct in its refusal to attribute to mankind the principle of social  unity To date Western society has escaped the most catastrophic  form of basic violence the violence that is capable of annihilating  society This privilege however has not been obtained through the  kind of depassement advanced by the idealist philosophers who cannot  conceive either of the nature of this privilege or the reason behind it  and indeed hardly realize their good fortune That is why modern  philosophers attribute the origin of society to a social contract ei ther implicit or explicit rooted in reason good sense mutual self interest and so forth They are incapable of grasping the essence of  religion and attributing to it a real function This incapacity is mythic  in character since it perpetuates the religions own misapprehensions  in regard to violence It evades the problem of human violence and  mistakes the nature of the threat this violence poses for human society   Even the crudest of religious viewpoints acknowledges a truth ig nored by even the most lucid nonreligious system The religious  believer knows that the establishment of a human society is no simple  matter and that the credit for its accomplishment cannot go to man  The relationship between modem thought and primitive religion is  somewhat different from what it appears at first glance Although  modern and primitive man share a fundamental misunderstanding of  the nature of violence primitive man retains certain insights into this  nature insights that are perfectly real and that wholly escape our  grasp   Religion instructs men as to what they must and must not do to  prevent a recurrence of destructive violence When they neglect rites  and violate prohibitions they call down upon themselves transcendent  violence which assumes the role of the demonic temptoran illusion  for which men will continue to fight spiritually as well as physically  to the point of total annihilation The surrogate victim alone can save  them almighty violence may judge the guilty parties to have been  sufficiently punished and may condescend to become its tran scendence once more to withdraw far enough away to observe man kind from the exterior of the community yet not so far away that it  ceases to inspire the dreadful awe that is essential to mans salvation   We the spoiled children of privilege consider the gods anger as  something illusory In fact it is a terrible reality Its justice is implac able its impartiality truly divine Anger shows no distinctions in its     260 Violence and the Sacred   dealings with men it is at one with reciprocity with the irresistible  tendency of violence to turn against the unfortunate beings who have  sought to shape it exclusively to their own uses   Because of their largescale and sophisticated organization modern  Western societies have appeared largely immune to violences law of  retribution In consequence modern thinkers assume that this law is  and has always been mere illusion and that those modes of thinking  that treat it as real are sheer fantasies To be sure these modes of  thinking must be considered mythic insofar as they attribute the en forcement of the law to an authority extrinsic to man But the law of  retribution itself is very real it has its origins in the reality of human  relationships If we are still strangers to this law it is not because we  have managed to transcend it but because its application to the mod ern world has been indefinitely postponed for reasons unknown to us  That perhaps is what contemporary history is making clear   a3 EACH OF THE PHENOiMENA discussed in this study  can be explained by the identity of violence and the sacred This  identity explains the dual influence for good and evil of blood in gen eral and menstrual blood in particular it also explains the structure of  Greek tragedy and Freuds Totem and Taboo The union of the sacred  with violence may seem fanciful or incredible it may jar our habitual  way of thinking But the more we look about us the more intelligible  this union appears   To the examples previously adduced I should like to add one that  seems particularly appropriate at this stage of the discussion It can be  phrased as a question Why is the production of metal particularly in  Africa accompanied by strict regulations and the metal workers  themselves endowed with sacred qualities The application of my gen eral theory should yield a ready answer to this small enigma which  forms part of the larger enigma of the sacred   Metal is the source of inestimable benefits It facilitates domestic  tasks and helps the community defend itself against outside enemies  But these advantages are not without a reverse side all weapons after  all are doubleedged The existence of metal increases the danger that  would result from an internal conflict its potentiality for good is  balanced by its potentiality for evil The dual tendency of human  relationstoward discord and conflict as well as toward cohesion and  harmonyis complemented by the nature of metals   For better or for worse the metal wrorker is the master of a potent  form of violence That is why he is sacred in the dual sense of the  word He enjoys certain privileges but is considered a slighdy sinister     Sacrificial Substitution 261   figure He is someone to be avoided and his forge is relegated to the  outskirts of the community   Some modern discussion of this phenomenon conveys the impres sion at least implicitly that the prestige of the metal worker arises  from the natives vague sense that he is somehow infringing on do mains reserved for superior civilizationsespecially the most su perior civilization of all our very own In this interpretation it is not  the dangers inherent in the production of metal or the uses to which  men put metal that inspire fear but rather the fact that metalworking  is the prerogative of the white man In short the cult of the metal  worker would be related directly or indirectly to a single real object  ourselves Such a theory bears witness to the monumental fatuousness  of a technological culture that has been so dulled by its long and  mysterious immunity from attack that it no longer has any conscious ness of hubris or even a word to describe that concept   Men who have mastered the techniques of metalworking have no  reason to regard the process with fear since after all they themselves  have mastered it The sacredness of the forge does not emanate from  us we have no monopoly on the technique and exert no influence  Promethean or otherwise on its practitioners The specters of nuclear  warfare and industrial pollution that menace our own society consti tute only one illustrationadmittedly a dramatic oneof a law that  primitive people regard as real even if thev do not entirely understand  it but that we dismiss as fictitious whoever uses violence will in turn  be used by it   The community that sponsors a forge on its outer boundaries is not  very different from our own As long as some profit can be derived from  them the metal workers or magicians are left in peace But as soon as  the community becomes aware of some backlash of violence it will  shift the responsibility to those who led the community into tempta tion the manipulators of sacred violence They will be accused of  having betrayed a community to which they only half belong of  having used against this community a power that had ahvays been  mistrusted The village may be visited by a calamity that has nothing  to do with metal or metal production nevertheless the metal workers  life will be in jeopardy In time of trouble he is the one who takes all  the blame   As soon as the sacredthat is violencehas found its wray to the  interior of the community the motif of the surrogate victim will start  to emerge The position of the metal worker even in time of peace  reveals his connection not only to the magician but also to the sacred  king In certain societies the metal worker without ceasing to be a     262 Violence and the Sacred   kind of pariah assumes the role of supreme arbiter In the event of an  irresolvable struggle he is called upon to differentiate the irrecon cilable antagonists thus proving that he incarnates the sacred violence  that is sometimes maleficent sometimes beneficent If the metal worker  or magician should happen to die at the hands of the community and  the communitys hysteria be thereby appeased the intimate connection  between the victim and the sacred seems confirmed Like all systems of  thought founded on sacrifice the reasoning that endows the metal  worker with sacred qualities forms a virtually closed system it can  never be refuted   The violent death of a metal worker a sorcerer a magician and in  general of anybody who seems to share a particular affinity with the  sacred might be seen as a halfway point between spontaneous collec tive violence and ritual sacrifice There is a perfect continuity from  one to the other To grasp the nature of this ambiguity is to move  closer to an understanding of generative violence and ritual sacrifice  and the relationship between these two phenomena   e THE FAILURE OF MODERN MAN to grasp the na ture of religion has served to perpetuate its effects Our lack of belief  serves the same function in our society that religion serves in societies  more directly exposed to essential violence We persist in disregarding  the power of violence in human societies that is why we are reluctant  to admit that violence and the sacred are one and the same thing It is  important to insist on this identity and the field of lexicography pro vides ample supporting evidence   Many languages most notably Greek contain terms that reveal the  nondifference between violence and the sacred And it is easily de monstrable that cultural evolution in general and lexicographers in  particular have a tendency to put asunder that which primitive lan guage has joined that it to suppress the scandalous conjunction of  violence and the sacred   We will take our examples from a work of great stature whose very  mistakes carry weight Emile Benvenistes he Vocabulahe des institu tions indoeuropeennes The use of the term hieros to qualify instru ments of violence and warfare is so regular that scholars sometimes  translate the word as strong active excited etc The Greek  hieros is related to the Vedic isirah which is generally translated as  vital force This is itself a compromise that conceals the conjunction  of the most maleficent and most beneficent forces in the nucleus of the  term It is the sort of compromise that modern scholars frequently  resort to when defining terms that have to do with the sacred   Benveniste asserts that hieros has nothing to do with violence and     Sacrificial Substitution 263   should always be translated as sacred He makes no mention of the  fact that even in French the word sacre retains an ambiguous sense  perhaps inherited from the Latin sacer To the linguist the fact that  hieros is frequently associated with terms implying violence is of no  importance The use of this term seems to him justified not by the  word it directly modifies but by the appearance in the text of some  god or some specifically religious motif he regards as wholly foreign to  the idea of violence   In order to eliminate from words relating to the sacred a duality he  finds both dubious and inconvenient Benveniste has recourse to two  procedures The first as we have just seen is to suppress altogether  whichever of the two meanings has been most weakened in the course  of the historical evolution of the word In those rare cases where  historical evolution has had no effect on the words duality or where  two opposite meanings both carry equal weight Benveniste unhesitat ingly affirms that we are really dealing with two different terms acci dentally grouped together under the same signifier This second  procedure is illustrated by Benvenistes treatment of kratos and its  derived adjective krateros Kratos is generally translated as divine  force Krateros is sometimes used of a god in which case it is trans lated as divinely strong7 supernaturally powerful and so forth At  other times it qualifies things that seem so foreign to our 7iotion of the  gods that the lexicographer flatly refuses the Greeks permission to  consider them divine   When from kratos we turn to krateros we expect the adjective to  convey the same sense as the substantive Kratos always denotes a quality  pertaining to heroes warriors and leaders it is reasonable to assume that  the adjective krateros has a eulogistic connotation and such is indeed  the case However this makes it all the more surprising to encounter  krateros being used to describe qualities which are very far from praise worthy and which incur blame or reproach When Hecuba Priams  wife calls the Achilles who has just killed her son Hector an oner kra teros Iliad XXlVr 212 she clearly intends no compliment on his  martial virtue Paul Mazon translates the phrase as brutal hero And to  appreciate the application of the adjective to Ares II 515 we must  consider it in the context of some of the gods other epithets imaiphonos  homicide andropkones killer of men brotoloigos fatal to mortals  aidelos destroyer   none of which present him in a favorable light   The discrepancy goes even deeper Whereas kratos applies exclusively  to gods and men krateros can refer to animals and objects and its sense  in those cases is always hard cruel violent      In Hesiod who uses some of the same vocabulary we find the two  meanings we have ascribed to the Homeric krateros favorable when it  accompanies the word anunon without reproach Theog 1013 un    264 Violence and the Sacred   favorable when it describes Ares the killer of men Scutum 92 101 or  a dragon Theo 328 or the Erinyes      The basis for the semantic partitioning of the word is its eulogistic  connotation the fact that it sheds favorable light the fact of its  beneficence Benveniste does not entertain the notion of a union of the  beneficent and maleficent within the context of sacred violence Kra teros can apply equally to a savage beast tearing apart its prey and  to the iron blade of a sword to the hardness of a breastplate to terrible  illnesses to the most barbarous acts to strife and to vehement con flicts Were we to quote every example offered by Benveniste virtu ally all the elements of the sacrificial crisis would pass in parade before  our eyes Thus we are dealing with a term that admirably displays the  conjunction of good and bad violence within the sacred Because the  two meanings of the word are too widely distributed for either of  them to be suppressed Benveniste concludes that the lexicographical  grouping around kratos reveals a very unusual semantic situation  This grouping he asserts is a unity in appearance only in reality the  two conflicting meanings should be attached to two IndoEuropean  roots of distinctly different origins though related if not actually sim ilar in form4   The sole basis for this theory is a refusal to admit the union of  violence and the divine that is made manifest by the various usages of  krateros The good krateros of gods and heroes is the same as the bad  krateros of monsters plagues and savage beasts An example cited by  Benveniste himselfAres kraterosshows the futility of his division  Here Benveniste asserts is an instance of the bad krateros That may  be but Ares is no less divine for being cruel and brutal And Ares is  the god of war It may be that the deification of war is a far more  significant matter than the bombastic odes dedicated to the military  glory of an Augustus or a Louis XIV might suggest   In the rationalists dictionary the sacred is defined either as a concept  that is still lacking in specificity or as a fully developed concept that  has become confused with other concepts The lexicographer takes it  upon himself to make a clean sweep of all ambiguities confusions  and uncertainties and to replace them with a perfectly coherent set  of significations In fact this tendency is not confined to lexicography  alone As we have seen religious interpretations of the sacrificial crisis  have always been inclined to categorize its accompanying phenomena  as either good or bad The farther one progresses the more pro nounced becomes the tendency to make separate and distinct entities   3Emile Benveniste La Vocabulaire des institutions i2doeuropeernesy 2 vols  Paris 1969 27S79   4 Ibid p 80     Sacrificial Substitution 265   of the two aspects of the sacred In Latin for example sacer has  retained its original double connotation but the need to isolate the  beneficent aspects of the word has resulted in an oflfshoot sanctiis So  it is that modern lexicography is caught up in the continuing mytho logical evolution that is little by little effacing the last signs of the  generative experience and making the true role of violence ever more  difficult to ascertain   Some however have resisted this impulse Here for example is  Henri Jeanmaires remarkable commentary on the word thysias which  signifies a priestess of Bacchus or one of the bacchantes The word is  derived from the verb thyiein which we discussed earlier on in con nection with another derivative thymos   The probable etymology of the word suggests that it is connected to a  verb whose sense remains somewhat ambiguous it signifies to make a  sacrifice on the one hand and on the other to hurl oneself impetuously  or to whirl around like something caught up in a tempest or to swirl  about like the waters of a river or sea or bubble up like spilled blood  like anger like mad rage There is no need to split these two sets of  usages as is sometimes done today no need to divide them into two  signifiers with different roots especially if we are willing to agree that  this tempestuous whirling motion corresponds to one of the methods by  which a bacchante attains her characteristic state of trance and that a  sacrifice a sparagmos or otherwise is the normal accompaniment of this  sort of state or even that certain archaic forms of sacrifice provided the  occasion for ecstatic exercises In addition some modern observers have  remarked that the death throes of the sacrificial victim and the convul sive gestures of the possessed person are both seen as manifestations of  divine intervention and that the analogy between them is appreciated  and explicitly expressed5    Q A 3  THE FORMAL IDENTIFICATION of violence with  the sacred as brought about by the mechanism of the surrogate victim  will now permit us to complete that theory of sacrifice whose basic  tenets were set forth in the earlier chapters of this study I have al ready rejected the traditional interpretation of sacrifice as an offering  made to the gods often in the form of food that provides nourish ment for the transcendent being This traditional interpretation is  certainly mythic but should not for that reason be regarded as simply  imaginary It is worth noting that religious discourse is closer to the  truth on this point than all the theories that modern scholars have  sought to put in its place   Polarized by the sacrificial killing violence is appeased It subsides   5Jeanmaire Dionysos p 158     266 Violence and the Sacred   We might say that it is expelled from the community and becomes  part of the divine substance from which it is completely indistinguish able for each successive sacrifice evokes in diminishing degree the  immense calm produced by the act of generative unanimity by the  initial appearance of the god Just as the human body is a machine for  transforming food into flesh and blood generative unanimity is a pro cess for changing bad violence into stability and fecundity On the  other hand by the very fact of its occurrence this unanimity has set  up a mechanism that will repeat its operation indefinitely in the at tenuated form of ritual sacrifice If the god is nothing more nor less  than the massive violence that was expelled by the original act of  generative unanimity then ritual sacrifice can indeed be said to offer  him portions of his own substance Every time the sacrifice accom panies its desired effect and bad violence is converted into good stabil ity the god is said to have accepted the offering of violence and  consumed it It is not surprising then that all theological systems place  sacrificial operations under the jurisdiction of the divinity Successful  sacrifice prevents violence from reverting to a state of immanence and  reciprocity that is it reinforces the status of violence as an exterior  influence transcendent and beneficent Sacrifice accords the god all  that he needs to assure his continued growth and vigor And it is the  god himself who digests the bad immanence transforming it into  good transcendence that is into his own substance The alimentary  metaphor is confirmed by the fact that in most cases the sacrificial  victim is an animal that man uses for food Behind this metaphor it is  easy to discern violence at work and to catch a glimpse of its meta morphoses Although religious explanations of sacrifice are wholly  false from the viewpoint of strict scientific truth they are perfectly  true from the only viewpoint of any interest to religionthat of pro tecting human beings from violence For if we neglect to feed the god  he will waste away or else maddened by hunger he will descend  among men and lay claim to his nourishment with unexampled cruelty  and ferocity   The surrogate victim is generally destroyed and always expelled  from the community As the violence subsides it is thought to have  departed with the victim to have somehow been projected outside the  community The community itself is felt to be free of infectionso  long that is as the cultural order within it is respected   Once the outer limits of the community have been crossed we enter  the domain of savage sacredness which recognizes neither boundaries  nor limits This is the realm not only of gods and supernatural crea tures of monsters and the dead but also of nature itself insofar as it     Sacrificial Substitution 261   remains untouched by culture of the cosmos and of all the rest of  humanity   We are wont to say that primitive peoples are imbued with the  sacred The truth is that these peoples assume just as we ourselves do  that they have freed themselves up to a point from subjection to the  sacred They alone adhere to the rules promulgated by the sacred  itself that allow them to maintain a precarious independence from  divine intervention Foreigners are considered something less and more  than human because they fail to follow these rules They may appear  very maleficent or very beneficent but in either case they are deeply  imbued with the sacred   Each community sees itself as a lonely vessel adrift in a fast ocean  whose seas are sometimes calm and friendly sometimes rough and  menacing The first requirement for staying afloat is to obey the rules  of navigation dictated by the ocean itself But the most diligent atten tion to these rules is no guarantee of permanent safety The ship is far  from watertight ceaselessly insidiously it takes in water Only a con stant repetition of rites seems to keep it from sinking   If it is true that the community has everything to fear from the  sacred it is equally true that the community owes its every existence  to the sacred For in perceiving itself as uniquely situated outside the  sphere of the sacred the community assumes that it has been engen dered by it the act of generative violence that created the community  is attributed not to men but to the sacred itself Having brought the  community into existence the sacred brings about its own expulsion  and withdraws from the scene thereby releasing the community from  its direct contact   The more men reflect on the apparent supremacy of the sacred on  the vast disproportion between it and the community the clearer it  becomes that the initiative in all domains on all levels belongs to the  sacred The birth of the community is first and foremost an act of  separation That is why metaphors of severance permeate the genera tive act For instance the royal rites of the Incwala involve a cutting  biting and slicing of the New Year In other words the new temporal  cycle is inaugurated by a break with the sacred which is invariably  bad when it has infiltrated the community Whether we refer to  catharsis or purification purgation or exorcism it is actually the idea  of evacuation and separation that is foremost Modern thinkers view  the sacred solely as a mediating force because they try to interpret  primitive reality in terms of a religion that has been purged of its  maleficent qualities But as we have seen any mingling of the com munity and the sacred whether due to the intervention of gods     268 Violence and the Sacred   mythic heroes or the dead produces exclusively maleficent results  Every supernatural visitation is prompted by the spirit of revenge  Benefits accrue only after the divinity has departed   This is not to say that the rnediative element has been eliminated A  total separation of the community and the sacred would be fully as  dangerous as a fusion of the two Too great a separation can result in a  massive onslaught of the sacred a fatal backlash then too there is  always the risk that men will neglect or even forget how to implement  the preventive measures taught them by the sacred itself as a defense  against its own violence Human existence thus remains under the con stant tutelage of the sacred and is observed regulated and promoted  by it   The outcome of this relationship is as follows although men cannot  live in the midst of violence neither can they survive very long by  ignoring its existence or by deluding themselves into the belief that  violence despite the ritual prohibitions attendant on it can somehow  be put to work as the mere tool or servant of mankind The complex  and delicate nature of the communitys dealings with the sacred the  ceaseless effort to arrive at the ordered and uninterrupted accord es sential to the wellbeing of the community can only be expressed for  want of the naked truth in terms of optimum distance If the com munity comes too near the sacred it risks being devoured by it if on  the other hand the community drifts too far away out of range of the  sacreds therapeutic threats and warnings the effects of its fecund  presence are lost   This spatial interpretation is clearly seen in societies in which the  sacred assumes the form of a special personagethe African sacred  king for example The presence in the midst of the community of a  figure deeply imbued with the sacred poses extraordinary problems In  certain cases the king is forbidden to touch the ground for fear of  contaminating it and thereby causing the death of his subjects Some times too the king is forbidden to feed himself the simple fact of his  having touched food makes it unsuitable fare for ordinary mortals  And there are cultures where the sacred monster is carefully hidden  from view not for his own protection but for that of his subjects who  would be struck dead by a single glance from him   Such precautions are designed to prevent direct contact They do  not mean to imply that it is bad to shelter such an extraordinary being  quite the contrary As we have seen the king is both very bad and  extremely good the historical alternation of violence and peace is  transferred from time to space The results have a faint analogy to  modern theories of the transformation of energyperhaps because  religious thought habitually draws its models from nature     Sacrificial Substitution 269   The kings subjects may feel ill at ease in his presence awed by his  sheer superabundance of power his siliwme Nevertheless they would  be terrified if they were deprived of his presence Our timidity and  respect are diluted forms of these same phenomena There is an  optimum distance from which to confront a divine incarnation it  permits the reception of beneficent effects without giving access to  maleficent ones The absolute can be likened to fire too near and one  gets burned too far away and one gets nothing Between these twro  extremes is a zone where one is warmed and heartened by the welcome  light       ALL SACRIFICIAL RITES are based on two substitu tions The first is provided by generative violence which substitutes a  single victim for all the members of the community The second the  only strictly ritualistic substitution is that of a victim for the surrogate  victim As we know it is essential that the victim be drawn from  outside the community The surrogate victim by contrast is a member  of the community Ritual sacrifice is defined as an inexact imitation of  the generative act Why we may ask does sacrifice systematically ex clude those who seem the most appropriate victims who bear the closest  resemblance to the original the members of the community   The need for some distinction between the original victim and the  ritual victims can readily be explained If the sacrificial victim be longed to the community as does the surrogate victim then his death  would promote further violence instead of dispelling it Far from reit erating the effects of generative violence the sacrifice would inaugurate  a new crisis But because certain conditions must be met an organization  capable of meeting them does not inevitably have to come into being  If we think it does we succumb to the functionalist illusion The second  sacrificial substitution still poses a problem that must be resolved   We may wonder if the difference between the original and the  copy between the primordial and the ritual victim does not have its  basis in human reason A kind of basic good sense would effect the  shift from within to without the community The functional dis crepancy between the two types of victim could easily be taken for  the humane1 in the sense of modern humanism aspect of the sacri fice What was referred to earlier as sacrificial trickery would in fact  be the sacrifices trickery they would choose to overlook some of the  demands of ritual mimesis And their casual atittude toward the gods  command would stem from an attitude they share with us moderns  deep within themselves they would sense the futility of these and  indeed of all rites   It is tempting to suppose that the second sacrificial substitution     270 Violence and the Sacred   shows that fanaticism has already given way to a primitive skepticism  that foreshadows our own Unfortunately this theory will not stand  up First of all there are many societies in which the victims are  human beings prisoners of war slaves children even in the case of  the sacred king and related sacrifices members of the community In  these instances there seems to be no second sacrificial substitution  This is why the connection between the original violence that had the  surrogate victim for object and the ritual imitations that succeeded it is  particularly striking in the case of the sacred king In Chapter 4 when  I was attempting to clarify the relationship between the surrogate  victim and the rite the sacred king served as a convenient example of  the proximity of the original victim to the ritual victim   This is not to sav that the second sacrificial substitution has been  entirely omitted in the case of the sacred king While an exact repeti tion of the generative violence is impossible the very fact that the  future victim has been drawn from the community and is designated to  replace the surrogate victim sets him apart from the other members of  the community and makes normal relations between himself and these  other members impossible He now belongs to a category that can  contain only one member at a time but it is one that nevertheless  qualifies as sacrificeable to almost the same degree as the categories  of cattle and sheep in other societies   If the sole fact of being selected as a future victim is sufficient to  metamorphose the chosen object to make a sacred personage out of  him then it is not hard to uncover the reasoning behind the different  choices of original victim and ritual victims When a victim has been  killed he belongs to the sacred it is the sacred itself that permits its  own expulsion or is expelled in the victims person The surrogate  victim thus appears as a monster He is no longer regarded in the same  way as the other members of the community   If the sacrificeable categories are generally made up of creatures  who do not and have never belonged to the community that is because  the surrogate victim belongs first and foremost to the sacred The  community by contrast has emerged from the sacred and separated  itself from it Members of the community then are less suitable as  ritual victims than are nonmembers That is why ritual victims are  chosen from outside the community from creatures like animals and  strangers that normally dwell amidst sacred things and are themselves  imbued with sacredness   From our vantage point as objective observers the other members of  the community seem closer to the original victim and consequently far  more suitable in accordance with the theory of imitation as sacrificial  objects But the viewpoint of the primordial religious experience is     Sacrificial Substitution 211   determined by the generative violence From that perspective the sur rogate victim is completely transformed It is this transformation that  serves to protect the community from violence that prevents the  faithful from choosing one of their own number as a replacement for  the original victim and that consequently helps prevent any new out break of reciprocal violence If the ritual victim is drawn from outside  the communityif the very fact of choosing a victim bestows on him  an aura of exterioritythe reason is that the surrogate victim is not  perceived as he really wasnamely as a member of the community  like all the others   This choice should not then be attributed to a kind of primitive  skepticism The centrifugal dynamism of the second substitution has  its origins in religion itself in protective misapprehension It has noth ing to do with a primitive effort to escape the tyranny of religion And  if the community is spared it is not because it has violated the law of  exact imitation but because it has rigorously observed it Whatever  deception is involved in the sacrificial act must be attributed to the  scapegoat mechanism not to its beneficiaries   We should not conclude however that the surrogate victim is sim ply foreign to the community Rather he is seen as a monstrous  double He partakes of all possible differences within the community  particularly the difference between within and without for he passes  freely from the interior to the exterior and back again Thus the  surrogate victim constitutes both a link and a barrier between the  community and the sacred To even so much as represent this extra ordinary victim the ritual victim must belong both to the community  and to the sacred   It should now be clear why ritual victims tend to be drawn from  categories that are neither outside nor inside the community but mar ginal to it slaves children livestock This marginal quality is crucial  to the proper functioning of the sacrifice   If the victim is to polarize the aggressive tendencies of the com munity and effect their transfer to himself continuity must be main tained There must be a metonymic relationship between members  of the community and ritual victims There must also be discontinuity  The victim must be neither too familiar to the community nor too  foreign to it We have previously noted that this ambiguity is essential  to the cathartic functioning of the sacrifice But we could not explain  how it was put into practice nor even imagine how an institution as  subtle and complex as that of sacrifice could function without its in ventors who are also its operators being aware of the secret of its  operation Now we see that there is nothing surprising in this fact at  least on the level that concerns us here Ritual requires the sacrifice of     272 Violence and the Sacred   a victim as similar as possible to the monstrous double The marginal  categories from which these victims are generally drawn barely fulfill  this requirement but they provide the least unsatisfactory com promise Situated as they are between the inside and the outside they  can perhaps be said to belong to both the interior and the exterior of  the community   Ritualistic thought does not limit itself to seeking out those cate gories that are the least unsuited for supplying ritual victims Once the  victims have been obtained it strives in various ways to make them  conform to its own image of the original victim and simultaneously to  increase their quotient of cathartic potential We consider that any thing involving this kind of intervention is sacrificial preparation that  is our use of the term goes beyond the usual definition of sacrificial  preparation as the ritual actions that immediately precede a sacrificial  killing   The victim should belong both to the inside and the outside of the  community As there is no category that perfectly meets this require ment any creature chosen for sacrifice must fall short in one or an other of the contradictory qualities required of it It will be deficient  in its exterior or its interior connections but never in both at the same  time The goal is to make the victim wholly sacrificeable In its broad est sense then sacrificial preparation employs two very different ap proaches The first seeks to make appear more foreign a victim who is  too much a part of the community The second approach seeks to  reintegrate into the community a victim who is too foreign to it   The sacred king illustrates the first sort of preparation His choice as  king is not sufficient to transform this future sacrificial victim into the  monstrous double he must reincarnate In order to eliminate his  lingering and superfluous humanity in order to cut him off from the  community he is required to commit an act of incest thereby absorb ing an enormous charge of maleficent sacredness At the end of the  period of preparation the king has taken on both the interior and the  exterior qualities that are required to transform him into a sacred  monster   The procedure must be inverted for a victim who sins by an excess  of exterior qualities The sacrifice of cattle in the Dinka ceremonies  described by Godfrey Lienhardt in Divinity and Experience illustrates  this second type of sacrificial preparation6 The Dinka never sacrifice  an animal fresh from the herd First it undergoes a period of isolation  from its fellow cattle being sheltered in a special place adjacent to  human habitations The halter it wears is reserved for sacrificial beasts   6 Cf Chapter 4 pp 9799     Sacrificial Substitution 213   Invocations are pronounced destined to bring it closer to the com munity and link it to the human members We have already discussed  the similar invocations that treat the victim as a human being7   In summary it is apparent that the intimate relationship that nor mally exists between the Dinka and their cattle remarkable though this  relationship may be is still not sufficient for sacrificial purposes The  identification between man and beast must be such that the latter as sumes the role of the original outcast and draws all the reciprocal  hostilities of the community to itself Every member of the com munity must be able to consider the beast before its metamorphosis  into a very sacred object as the logical target for his anger   Sacrificial preparations involve many actions that may seem con tradictory but all are perfectly adapted to their goals With persistent  foresight the religious mind pursues its ends and without realizing it  fulfills all the conditions for catharsis Its only interest is to imitate the  generative violence as faithfully as possible It strives to procure and if  need be to invent a sacrificial victim as similar as possible to its am biguous vision of the original victim The model it imitates is not the  true model but a model transfigured by the mechanism of the mon strous double This transfiguration this primordial difference directs  all religious thought toward victims that thanks to their nature and  sacrificial preparation are neither divisive nor trivial victims thus as suring for the ritual performance a cathartic value beneficial to the  community that enacts it   We encounter once again a remarkable fact religious misapprehen sion figures largely in the very real protection offered society by ritual  sacrifice and indeed by religion in general   7 Cf Chapter 1 p 13         Chapter Eleven   The Unity of All Rites   fSj4 WE MAY NOW TURN our attention to certain ritual    3  N  forms that because of their frankly disagreeable nature  are often regarded as aberrations In fact they are neither more nor  less explicable than any other rites when viewed without reference to  generative violence and they become perfectly intelligible when  seen in that context Our discussion of the second type of sacrificial  preparationthe integration into the community of a victim of foreign  originleads directly into a consideration of the most notorious  example of cannibalistic ritual as practiced by the Tupinamba Indians  of northwest Brazil1   The Tupinamba occupy a prominent place in the intellectual history  of modern Europe The two Indians whom Montaigne met in Rouen  and referred to in his Essays were members of this tribe They thus  served as models for the most famous preeighteenthcentury portrait  of the noble savage who was shortly to play a great role in the  history of Western humanism   War was endemic among this people who made it a practice to  devour all the enemies they could lay their hands on However their  cannibalism assumed two distinct forms An enemy killed in the course  of battle was eaten on the spot without further ado Outside the com munity and its laws there was no place for ritual undifferentiated  violence held sway   The ritual form of cannibalism was reserved for enemies who were  brought alive to the village These prisoners lived for months and  sometimes years on intimate terms with the men who would one day  devour them They participated in their captors daily activities and  married into their families much the same relationship existed for a  while between themselves and their sacrificers for as we shall see we  are dealing with sacrifice here as their sacrificers maintained among  themselves   The prisoner was subjected to two apparently contradictory modes   11 will discuss only those aspects of the Tupinamba rituals that bear directly  on my argument For further information on these practices see Alfred Metraux  Religions et magies indiermes dAnterique du Sud Paris 1967 pp 4379   214     The Unity of All Rites 215   of treatment Sometimes his sexual favors were sought after and he  was treated with respect and even veneration At other times he was  the object of abuse showered with insults and blows   Shortly before the date of his execution the prisoners escape was  ritually staged Invariably of course he was quickly recaptured and  for the first timebound with a heavy rope around his ankles His  master now stopped giving him food and he was forced to resort to  stealing One of the early travelers cited by Metraux reports that the  prisoner was permitted during this period to lay about him with his  fists to steal fowl and geese and other things and to do his utmost to  avenge his coming death1 In short the future victim was encouraged  to violate the laws Most modern observers agree that the purpose of  these indulgences was to transform the prisoner into a scapegoat  Francis Huxley remarks   It is the fate of the prisoner to act out a number of contradictory roles  and incarnate them in himself He is an enemy who is adopted he takes  the place of the man in whose honour he will be killed he is an inlaw  and an outcast he is honoured and reviled a scapegoat and a hero he is  intimidated but if he shows fear is thought unworthy of the death that  awaits him By acting out these primarily social roles he becomes a  complete human being exemplifying the contradictions that society  creates an impossible situation which can only end in his death The  impossibility is exaggerated when he is charged by ritual with the  powers and attributes of the culturehero he becomes the representative  of the other world living in the centre of this one a Janus figure too  sacred to live with2   This is an admirable summary although it should be added that the  recipient of societys contradictory drives does not in the end appear as  a paragon of humanity but as a monstrous double and a god As  Huxley points out it is the true relationship between society and  human nature that is laid forth here and because this truth is intoler able it must somehow be expelled This is where generative violence  plays its role its basic function is to get rid of the truth to transpose it  beyond the realm of human activity   In order to understand this operation we must realize that the surro gate victim actually brings about communal cohesion Indeed ritual  cannibalism remains inaccessible to the intellect unless some basis in  social reality can be found for it And as long as we insist on interpret ing the scapegoat in purely psychological terms we can only assume  that cannibals are seeking some sort of moral justification for their acts  of violence It is true that the more misdeeds the prisoner commits the   2 Francis Huxley Affable Savages New York 1966 p 254     216 Violence and the Sacred   more legitimate the sanctions imposed on him might appear But the  primary purpose of the rites has nothing to do with satisfying some  neurosis or putting to rest some guilt complex They are meant to  bring about solid concrete results If the modern mind fails to recog nize the strongly functional nature of the scapegoat operation and all  its sacrificial surrogates the most basic phenomena of human culture  will remain misunderstood and unresolved   The mechanism of the surrogate victim is redemptive twice over by  promoting unanimity it quells violence on all fronts and by preventing  an outbreak of bloodshed within the community it keeps the truth  about men from becoming known The mechanism transposes this  truth to the realm of the divine in the form of an inscrutable god   The prisoner drew to his person all the communitys inner tensions  all its accumulated bitterness and hatred Through his death he was  expected to transform maleficent violence into sacred beneficence to  reinvigorate a depleted cultural order Ritual cannibalism is a rite that  functions like any of the other rites I have discussed The Tupinamba  were following a modelor rather their ritual system was following a  model They were trying to reproduce an original event that actually  took place to recover the unanimity that occurred and recurred  around the person of the surrogate victim If the prisoner was treated  in two contradictory ways if he was sometimes vilified and sometimes  honored it was because he represented the primordial victim He was  hated insofar as he polarized the as yet untransformed violence he was  revered insofar as he transformed the violence and set in motion the  unifying mechanism of the surrogate victim The more detestable the  victim was made to appear and the more passion he aroused the more  effectively the machinery functioned   The role of the Tupinamba prisoner is therefore similar to that of  the African king Consecrated by his future death his person repre sentsnot successively but simultaneouslytwo aspects of the sacred  He takes upon himself the totality of violence during his lifetime and  bears his burden for eternity beyond reach of time   It seems likely that the prisoner was intended to reincarnate a myth ical hero who in certain versions of Tupinamba legend appeared as a  prisoner who was about to be executed and eaten Thus from the  perspective of the practitioners ritual cannibalism was designed to  reproduce a primordial event   The cannibalism of the Tupinambas like the incestuous practices of  certain African monarchies inflames our imagination and tends to dis tract attention from the essential intent of the ritual the basic trait that  it shares with all other rituals its sacrificial aspect We are perhaps  more distracted by incest than by cannibalism but only because can    The Unity of All Rites 277   nibalism has not yet found its Freud and been promoted to the status  of a major contemporary myth Some modern film makers have tried  to be sure to bring cannibalism into fashion but their efforts to date  have been less than successful   Mircea Eliade makes the acute observation that the sacred precedes  cannibalism that cannibalism may be said not to exist in a natural  state3 In other words the victim is not killed to be eaten but eaten  because he has been killed The same is true of animal victims that are  afterward eaten The cannibalistic element then requires no special  explanation Moreover it serves to help explain other far more mys terious rites The eating of sacrificial flesh whether animal or human  can be seen in the light of mimetic desire as a veritable cannibalism of  the human spirit in which the violence of others is ritually devoured  Mimetic desire once frustrated seeks at once to destroy and to absorb  the violence incarnated with the modelobstacle This explains why  cannibals are always eager for their victim to demonstrate by a show  of courage that he is the incarnation of supreme violence And of  course the victim is eaten only after he has been killed after the  maleficent violence has been completely transformed into a beneficent  substance a source of peace strength and fecundity   Once we have recognized that ritual cannibalism is simply another  form of sacrificial rite the prisoners preliminary adoption and partial  assimilation into the tribe that is going to eat him no longer presents a  mystery Because the victim comes from outside the community from  the realm of the undifferentiated sacred he is too foreign to be im mediately eligible as a proper sacrificial offering If he is to become a  true representative of the original victim he must first establish some  sort of relationship with the group and be made to appear like an  insiderwithout however surrendering that sacred exteriority that  remains his essential characteristic   Through the process of sacrificial preparation the victim acquires a  sufficient resemblance to the natural direct target of violencethat  is the other members of the communityto ensure the transference of  their aggressions and to make him an attractive sacrificial object At  the same time he remains sufficiently foreign for his death not to risk  plunging the community into a cycle of revenge The only person  able and perhaps to some extent required to espouse the victims cause  is his wife But she must not be too insistent in her protests or she too  along with her children if she has any will be summarily executed   It is now clear how a scrupulous imitation of the surrogate victim  though necessarily affected by the transformation of the first victim   3 Mircea Eliade The Sacred and the Profane New York 1961 p 103     21S Violence and the Sacred   establishes a system of ritual practices that conforms to the needs of  the community These practices ensure the purgation of violence its  transference to victims whose relationship to the community is neither  too close nor too distant who are in short suitable figures for reliev ing the community of its burden of violence and effecting its purifica tion It is equally clear that this system including the sacrificial  preparation that contributes to the efficiency of the total operation  can arise purely and simply from an effort to imitate the original  murder the act that either established or reestablished communal  unitv   The prisoners adoption by the community should be regarded as  belonging to the second type of sacrificial preparation referred to  above Ritual cannibalism resembles African kingship in that the future  victim is consecrated during his lifetime To discern the relationship  between the two rites we might think in terms of Jean Genets Death watch which deals with a condemned prisoner whose favors are  sought by a pair of petty criminalsenemy brothers so to speak  who are fascinated by the prospect of his imminent execution   The relationship between the African kingship system and the  cannibalism of the Tupinambas is somewhat blurred because in the  former case the victim is drawn from within the community in the lat ter from without The process of sacrificial preparation functions in  a contradictory manner to achieve the same results in both cases By  integrating the prisoner within the community the Tupinamba are  pursuing the same goal as the Dinka who separate their sacrificial beast  from the herd and shelter it among the villagers Among the Tupi namba the practical application of the principle is carried to far greater  lengths And the tribes extraordinary adoption of the prisoner seems  to support my theory that the surrogate victim is fundamentally a  member of the community a neighbor of those destined to kill him  The Tupinamba seem to have been particularly conscious of the near ness of the original victim and in order to reproduce this quality  without compromising the sacrificial effectiveness of the rite they  devised a system of implacable logic and rare ingenuity   H4 A S  T H E C A S E o f t h e Tsimshians see Chapter 9  violence among the Tupinamba is shifted from the interior of the  community to the exterior This displacement is sacrificial in character  and is by no means limited to mere verbiage the communities actually  go to war with one another and devour their respective members  Here again it can be said that the tribes have come to an agreement  never to agree that a permanent state of war is maintained for the  express purpose of providing victims for ritual cannibalism The num    The Unity of All Rites 219   ber of captives on either side should be more or less equal in order to  constitute a more or less reciprocal exchange and this exchange would  seem somehow to be linked to the exchange of women which is also  again as in the case of the Tsimshians accompanied by violence But  whether it is a question of prisoners or women the exchange ritualized  into warfare and the warfare ritualized into exchange are both variants  of the same sacrificial shift from the interior of the community to the  exterior Both are equally beneficial in that they keep violence from  exploding precisely where it would do the most damage in the midst  of the elementary group Thus the interminable vengeance engulfing  two rival tribes may be read as an obscure metaphor for vengeance  that has been effectively shifted from the interior of the community  This displacement is not of course mere shadow play The system  works precisely because the intimate rivalry between the groups is  very real Moreover it is evident that this sort of warfare cannot  always be confined within reasonable limits   The various meanings of the word tobajara seem to define the  parameters of the type of ritual cannibalism practiced by the Tupi nambas In its primary sense it designates the symmetrical posture  assumed by the subject in regard to the opposition the hostile con frontation The word is related to a verb meaning to be face to face  to be opposite4   It is worth noting with regard to tobajara that the prisoners mur der is carried out in a manner that resembles as closely as possible the  structure of single combat The victim is tied with a rope but given  enough free play to allow him to defend himself for a limited time  against the attack of his solitary adversary his own personal tobajara   It is not surprising that the word tobajara refers specifically to the  victim of cannibalism But the word also has a third meaning brother inlaw The brotherinlaw is the substitute for the brother the most  natural adversary In exchange for one of his women the brotherin law is ceded a woman too close to the giver a woman who would  inevitably become the object of fraternal rivalry if the men of the  elementary community reserved their women for their own use The  brotherinlaw then becomes the sacrificial substitute for the brother  as hostile object The entire structure of the sacrificial system is im plicit in the triple semantic thrust of tobajara And this structure re minds us once more of Greek tragedy which abounds in enemy  brothers and enemy brothersinlaw for example Eteocles and Poly neices Oedipus and Creon   The ideology of ritual cannibalism brings to mind the nationalistic   4 Huxley Affable Savages p 242     280 Violence and the Sacred   myths of our own modern world Of course it is conceivable that the  observers have distorted the natives own explanations but even if this  were the case the distortions would not effect the general oudine of  my interpretation A sacrificial cult based on war and the reciprocal  murder of prisoners is not substantially different from nineteenth century nationalistic myths with their concept of an hereditary  enemy To insist on the differences between two myths of this type is  in effect to succumb to the mystique of the myths themselves to turn  away from the identical reality residing at the center of each In both  instances the basic function of foreign wars and of the more or less  spectacular rites that generally accompany them is to avert the threat  of internal dissension by adopting a form of violence that can be  openly endorsed and fervently acted upon by all   In his novel 1984 George Orwell portrays the dictators of two  superstates as cynically resolved to perpetuate their struggle in order  to maintain permanent control over their mesmerized subjects The  institution of ritual cannibalism based on the principle of permanent  war and designed to perpetuate domestic tranquillity reminds us that  the modern world has no monopoly on such stratagems It also demon strates that the concept of permanent warfare is not particular to  sophisticated and unscrupulous tyrants but can be put into practice by  the primitive communities   eft4 IT IS NOT DIFFICULT to see the relationship between  Tupinamba cannibalism and a theory of ritual based on the concept of  the surrogate victim In fact this relationship serves to illuminate  aspects of the Tupinamba practice that have hitherto seemed obscure  reciprocally the Tupinamba customs bring into relief certain aspects  of the theory that my examination of other rites neglected or ignored   Limited though they are in number the ritual practices I have men tioned differ gready in character as well as in geographical location  Yet in spite of their diversity they all seem to support my claim that  the surrogate victim is the basis for all religious systems It might be  prudent however to examine still another type of ritual one that may  serve to invalidate this line of argument   The rites I have discussed up to this point might be said to perpetu ate or reinforce certain domestic or religious systems Their purpose is  the maintenance of the status quo and this purpose explains why they  all center around that exemplary guarantor of cultural stability the  unanimous act of violence directed against the surrogate victim   These rites may be defined as rites of stability or stasis However  there also exists a body of rites generally referred to as rites of passage  I have not yet considered such rites in the light of my theory I will     The Unity of All Rites 281   not attempt to demonstrate that the surrogate victim lies at the heart of  these rites as well   Rites of passage have to do with the acquisition of a new status For  example there are initiation rites that confer on adolescents full admis sion to the community In our own society the passage from one status  to another presentsat least in theoryonly minor problems of  adaptation which are limited to those individuals directly involved in  the process those who are actually making the passage Although this  belief has been somewhat shaken in recent times it continues to exert a  strong influence on our thought and conduct   In primitive societies however the slightest change in the status of  an isolated individual is treated as if it carried the potential to create a  major crisis What to us appear to be perfecdy normal and predictable  transitions essential to the preservation of the social unit are regarded  by primitive man as portents of apocalyptic upheaval   Arnold Van Genneps Rites oj Passage the work that introduced  the term into ethnological parlance distinguishes two distinct stages in  a primitives change of status In the first stage he loses his previous  status and in the second he acquires his new one To attribute this  observation to a typically French predilection for neat Cartesian cate gories would be somewhat unfair for Van Genneps analysis does  conform to the processes of religious thought Religious thought does  indeed distinguish between these stages perceiving them as quite inde pendent of one another separated by a gap that could well become a  terrible abyss swallowing up the entire cultural structure   Van Genneps observations serve to underline the critical aspect of  the process When he focuses on the initial loss of status he calls to  mind that loss of difference I described earlier suddenly we find our selves on familiar terrain For if all violence involves a loss of differ ence all losses of difference also involve violence and this violence is  contagious Thus we are dealing with the sort of dilemma we encoun tered in the case of twins Religious thought makes no distinctions  between natural and cultural differences Perfectly innocent phe nomena can provoke fear but that fear cannot for that reason be  dismissed as mere fantasy there is nothing fantastical about its impact  or its results   The individual who is in passage is regarded in the same light as a  criminal or as the victim of an epidemic his mere physical presence  increases the risk of violence The slightest loss of difference no mat ter how isolated the case may be is capable of plunging the entire  community into a sacrificial crisis The slightest tear in the social fabric  can spoil the whole garment if not promptly attended to   dearly the first measure in such a situation is to isolate the victim     282 Violence and the Sacred   to forbid all contact between him and the healthy members of the  community he must be placed in quarantine All suspected victims are  included in this proscription They are kept on the periphery of the  community or sometimes even exiled to the forest jungle or desert  There undifferentiated violence reigns there is the sacred realm in habited by beings devoid of those stable differences of that fixed  status possessed by men who have freed themselves from the power of  the sacred   Because the modern mind conceives contagion solely in terms of  microbiology it sees no reason why any particular loss of status cannot  be restricted to its specific case Primitive societies view the matter  differently For them any change in individual status threatens to be come universal It is the nature of such changes to spread like a disease  the individual becomes the first victim and prime carrier of his own  infection In some societies the individual in passage is stripped of his  name his history and his family connections he is reduced to an  amorphous state of anonymity In collective initiations where adoles cents of the same age participate together in rites of passage total  equality and unrestricted promiscuity is the rule   As we have seen differences disappear in the domain of the sacred  only because they are indiscriminately mixed together and become  indistinguishable in the confusion To be associated with the sacred is  to share in this monstrosity to be lacking in differences or over equipped with them comes to the same thing That is why the initiate  can appear both as a hermaphroditic aberration and as a creature with  no sexual identity at all   The rite of passage is always an awesome experience because it is  impossible to predict at the outset what its course will be Although  the initiate knows what he is losing he has no idea what he will be  taking on Violence will determine the final result of this monstrous  mixture of differences and the less one has to do with that the better  In short structure and change dont go together And even when  change looks predictable to us religious man fears that it might be come uncontrollable The idea of a nature subservient to social laws or  even to natural laws is utterly foreign to primitive religion   Conservative is a word too weak to describe the rigidity of spirit  and terror of change that characterizes those societies in which the  sacred holds sway The imposition of a socioreligious order appears as  an enormous boon an unhopedfor act of grace that could at any  moment be withdrawn There is no question of subjecting the order to  critical evaluation or comparison of trying to alter and improve it in  any way The primitive mind would regard such endeavors as at once  impious and insane guaranteed to provoke the violent retribution of     The Unity of All Rites 283   the gods The proper posture for man is watchfulness and immobility  A single careless gesture could unleash a holocaust in which society  would be utterly destroyed   Although the prospect of the passage may appear terrifying to the  primitive mind it also offers hope After all it was by way of a general  outbreak of violence and universal loss of differencethat is by way  of sacrificial crisisthat the community achieved a differentiated order  in former times And it can be hoped that this crisis will achieve the  same results Differences will be restored or established specifically  the neophyte will gain his coveted new status A happy outcome must  depend on the good will of supreme violence but the community  believes that it can influence this outcome by channeling the bad  energy into prearranged outlets In order for the final results to match  those of the original action however every possible precaution must  be taken to follow the original model The neophytes must adhere to  the rules laid down by tradition they must try to shape the new event  in the mold of the old one For only if the ritual reiterates the original  crisis is there hope that the outcome will be the same   Such is the reasoning behind these rites of passage We can now  readily understand that some of the most bizarre aspects of the rites  variations that have previously been dismissed as morbid or per verse are simply the logical outcome of certain basic religious views  Instead of avoiding the crisis the neophyte must advance to meet it as  his ancestors did before him Instead of fleeing the most painful and  terrifying aspects of reciprocal violence he must submit to each and  every one of them in the proper sequence The postulant must endure  hardship hunger even torture because these ordeals were part of the  original experience In some instances it is not enough to submit to  violence one must also inflict violence This double obligation cor responds to the bad reciprocity associated with the sacrificial crisis  It also reminds us that the celebrants in certain festivals are required to  perform a number of actions that are normally forbidden real or  symbolic acts of sexual aggression stealing the eating of proscribed  foods In some societies cannibalism prohibited at all other times  forms the essence of the initiation rites For the Tupinamba the mur der of a prisoner constitutes the rite Indeed in many societies the  ultimate act of initiation is the killing of an animal or a human being   Any man deprived of his status is transformed into a monstrous  double For the initiate this transformation is exteriorized Sometimes  he assumes the role of an animal threatening to pounce on and devour  anyone who comes near him Like Dionysus or the sacred king he  becomes a lion or a leopard for the duration of the initiatory crisis  expressing himself solely in growls and roars In some rites normally     284 Violence and the Sacred   marking the culmination of the crisis he exhibits all the characteristics  of violent possession The successive stages of the rites allow us to  trace the real or supposed evolution of the crisis   Other rites offer additional proof that the entire course of the cere mony is modeled on the original crisis In addition to rites specifically  designed to simulate the crisis itself we encounter details that reproduce  the unanimous violence directed against the surrogate victim and that  clearly serve to bring the whole ritualistic process to a close The intro duction of masks at the supreme moment of the process can be taken as  a direct allusion to the monstrous double whose presence had already  been suggested by the metamorphoses of the neophytes The forms  of the ceremonies may vary widely but they all bear witness to the vio lent resolution of the crisis and the subsequent return to order that is  to the neophytes assumption of their new and definitive status   The purpose of rites of passage then is to graft onto the model of  the original crisis any burgeoning crisis brought into being by a sudden  outbreak of undifferentiation in other words to change into certainty  that awful uncertainty that accompanies contagious violence With  regular repetition and a pattern of success these rites are gradually  transformed into simple tests or trials becoming increasingly sym bolic1 and formalistic The sacrificial nature of the rites tends to  become obscured with the passage of time until finally it is hard to say  what the symbols are intended to symbolize   e4 AS WE HAVE SEEN there is no real difference be tween rites of passage and rites intended to maintain the status quo In  both cases the model is the same The sole purpose of ritual is to ensure  total immobility or failing that a minimum of disturbance If the door  is opened to admit change there is always the risk that violence and  chaos will force an entry Some change of course is inevitable men  cannot be prevented from growing up marrying falling sick and  dying But primitive societies have found procedures to direct the  dangerous flow of energy generated by these events into channels  prepared by the cultural order Some societies even have rituals to  cope with the change of seasons Wherever there is a potential for  dangerous change the remedy lies in ritual and the rites invariably  entail a repetition of the original solution a rebirth of differences The  model for cultural stability is identical with the model for noncata strophic change In the final analysis then rites of passage have the  same function and the same origin as all other rites   That is not to say that rites of passage do not have distinctive char acteristics Their most spectacular elements are modeled on the crisis  itself rather than on the resolution of the crisis as is true of most     The Unity of All Rites 285   other rites and this emphasis gives them their particular initiatory  quality This is also why these rites tend to linger on during periods of  general decadence maintaining their hold even when the most fun damental ritualistic practices have fallen into neglect or disappeared  completely As we have already observed the generative conclusion is  the first thing to disappear This disappearance cuts the umbilical cord  so to speak that links all rites to generative violence The rites then  appear to exist on their own although this is pure illusion   With the passage of time the terror inspired by the original crisis  fades from memory The younger generation no longer respects the  prohibitions laid down by the religious system or watches jealously  over its preservation The younger men have no personal acquaintance  with maleficent violence In subjecting them to rites of passage the  culture is trying to induce a state of mind favorable to the perpetua tion of a differentiated system It attempts to recreate the atmosphere  of sacred terror and veneration characteristic of its ancestral period  when rites and prohibitions were scrupulously observed   The structure of the sacrificial crisis and of generative violence per mits us to understand the means by which violence is deflected and  diffused in human society and this in turn explains why xites of passage  can fulfill a function only as long as they maintain their character as  impressive painful and at times almost unendurable ordeals As al ways it is a question of keeping the sacrificial crisis in check in this  instance the concern is directed at the inexperienced neophyte whose  youthful impetuosity could well unleash a new crisis   Rites of passage give the young person a foretaste of what lies in  store for anyone rash enough to neglect or transgress prescribed reli gious rituals Thanks to these rites successive generations acquire a  healthy respect for the awesomeness of the sacred and learn to perform  their religious obligations in such a way as to assure the stability of the  cultural order Phvsical hardships speak louder than intellectual argu ments it is these hardships that make the establishment of the socio religious order appear an extraordinary blessing   Rites of passage thus constitute a vitally important force in the  conservation of institutions Thev assure the dominance of generations  long gone over generations yet to come It would be wrong however  to regard them as a conscious political device for keeping the young in  their place a scheme directed by the haves against the havenots As  with all the rites discussed previously the mechanisms set in motion by  rites of passage can never be fullv anticipated In fact their effective ness seems to depend on their not being viewed in the context of strict  social utility Their efficacy is a consequence of the religious attitude in  general which precludes all those forms of conscious social engineer    286 Violence and the Sacred   ing that modern man likes to think he can detect in the socially effi cient traditional organizations    T H E PATTERN RECURS in all forms of initiation initiation into adulthood into secret societies into a religious order or  into a shamanistic fraternity The shamans initiation for instance  differs from the others only in the dramatic and rigorous quality of the  hardships the initiate must endure and in the explicit identification  with a divinity or spirit whose awesome and fantastic adventures recall  the mechanism of the surrogate victim   The shaman claims mastery over supernatural forces If he wishes  to acquire the means of ridding men of illnesses the apprentice shaman  must first expose himself to the full fury of these illnessesthat is  expose himself to maleficent violence He emerges triumphant from an  ordeal that would have killed an ordinary mortal thus demonstrating  that he not only enjoys the protection of Supreme Violence but also  shares in its power and can even to some extent effect the transforma tion of bad into good violence   Even the most fantastic details of the shamans initiation faithfully  reflect a ritualistic viewpoint on generative violence In isolated cul tures as far apart as Australia and Asia the initiation culminates in a  vision of dismemberment after which the neophyte awakens or  rather is reborn as a fullfledged shaman This final vision calls to mind  the collective ritual dismemberment of the Dionysiac rites the di asparagmos and many similar rituals of diverse provenance Dismem berment is emblematic of triumph and resurrection it reflects the  operation of the surrogate victim the transformation of maleficent  violence into beneficent violence The neophyte experiences the same  metamorphosis as the mythical creatures whose help he will later re quire in the exercise of his shamanistic functions And if he manages to  secure their aid it will be because he is able to approach them on equal  terms as someone who has shared their experiences   Shamanism is like a theatrical performance in which one actor plays  all the roles at once The lead role however is clearly that of com mander in chief of the forces of Good which finally rout the forces of  Evil This final expulsion is frequently associated with some kind of  symbolic object for example the healer may hold up a twig or a bit  of cotton that he claims to have extracted from the body of the patient  and that supposedly caused the illness   The Greek term for an evil object extracted by means of a similar  ritual is katharma This term was also used as a variant of pharmakos to  designate a sacrificial human victim   In the ritual context of crisis and victimization interpreted as an     The Unity of All Rites 287   expulsion of evil the extraction of a shamanistic katharma becomes  intelligible The illness is equated to the crisis it can lead either to  death or to a cure invariably seen as the expulsion of impurities  spiritual impurities in the form of evil spirits or physical impurities in  the form of the shamanistic object Once again the process is based on  a repetition of a successful scapegoat effect The patient is induced to  give birth to his own cure just as the entire community at one time  gave birth in the midst of collective violence to a new order The  extracted object had no place in the human organism and no right to  be there It was something brought in by outside forces It plays the  part of the actual surrogate victim whereas the human organism fully  mobilized against the invader takes the part of the collectivity If as  has long been assumed primitive medicine is indeed ritualistic in na ture then it is not surprising that its primary purpose is to reproduce  the generative process   The word katharsis refers primarily to the mysterious benefits that  accrue to the community upon the death of a human katharma or  pharmakos The process is generally seen as a religious purification  and takes the form of cleansing or draining away impurities Shortly  before his execution the pharmakos is paraded ceremonially through  the streets of the village It is believed that he will absorb all the  noxious influences that may be abroad and that his death will transpose  them outside the community This is a mythical representation of what  does in fact almost take place The communal violence is indeed drawn  to the person of the surrogate victim but the final resolution cannot be  described as the expulsion of some substance The interpretation thus  approaches the truth but fails to attain it because it fails to perceive  three essential facts the mimetic nature of reciprocal violence the  arbitrary choice of the victim and the unanimous polarization of hos tility that produces the reconciliation To view violence as an impurity  or blemish that is located in a physical substance is to materialize  violence once again When the shaman draws forth from his patient an  object he identifies as the sickness itself he is transferring and trans forming this mythical interpretation into yet another formthat of a  small insignificant object   In addition to its religious sense and its particular meaning in the  context of shamanism the word katharsis has a specific use in medical  language A cathartic medicine is a powerful drug that induces the  evacuation of humors or other substances judged to be noxious The  illness and its cure are often seen as one or at least the medicine is  considered capable of aggravating the symptoms bringing about a  salutary crisis that will lead to recovery In other words the crisis is  provoked by a supplementary dosage of the affliction resulting in the     288 Violence and the Sacred   expulsion of the pathogenetic agents along with itself The operation is  the same as that of the human katharma although in medicine the act  of purgation is not mythic but real   The mutations of meaning from the human katharma to the medical  katharsis are paralleled by those of the human pharmakos to the medi cal pharmakony which signifies at once poison and remedy In  both cases we pass from the surrogate victimor rather his represen tativeto a drug that possesses a simultaneous potential for good and  for bad one that serves as a physical transposition of sacred duality  Plutarchs use of the expression kathartikon pharmakon seems mean ingfully redundant in this context   The translation of this violent process into terms of expulsion  evacuation and surgical operations is made in the most diverse cul tures For example the Swazi Incwala involves ritual acts whose literal  meanings denote the biting cutting and slicing of the new year These  words belong to a semantic grouping that includes a variety of highly  significant operations from the consummation of the kings first mar riage to decisive victory in an armed conflict The common denomi nator appears to be acute suffering destined to assure recovery from an  illness or designed to bring about the natural or artificial resolution of a  potential crisis The same grouping designates the therapeutic action of  certain substances In the course of the Incwala rites the king spits out  magic medicinal potions first toward the east then toward the west  The term Incwala is apparently connected with the notion of cleanli ness the process of cleansing by evacuation As has been mentioned  see above Chapter 4 the ceremony concludes with a great fire that  consumes the accumulated refuse of the past year Max Gluckman  describes the general effect of the rites in terms of Aristotelian  catharsis   Katharma and katharsis are derived from katharos If we wished to  group together all the themes associated with these terms we would  find ourselves with a veritable catalog of the subjects discussed here  under the double heading of violence and the sacred Katharma is not  limited to the victim or die surrogate object it also refers to the  supreme efforts of a mythic or tragic hero Plutarch speaks of the  pontia katharmata expulsions that purified the seas with reference to  the labors of Heracles Kathairo means among other things to purge  the land of monsters Its secondary meaning to whip may appear  puzzling in this context until we recall the practice of whipping the  pharmakos on the genitals   It is worth noting that katharsis is used in connection with purifica tion ceremonies that form part of the mysteries initiation rites     The Unity of All Rites 289   the word is also sometimes used to designate menstruation Such  usages make it clear that we axe not dealing here with a heterogeneous  collection of references but rather with a unified system to which the  surrogate victim holds the key   Whenever we describe the generative process or its products in  terms of expulsion purgation or purification we are attributing natu ral causes to phenomena that are not in the least natural because they  derive from violence Expulsions evacuations and purgations are  found in nature the natural model does indeed exist But its reality  should not distract us from the extraordinary role that this model has  played in the history of the human imagination from primitive reli gious rituals and shamanistic medicine down to the present day The  pattern outlined in Chapter 8 should provide the perspective Violence  furnishes the initial impetus for the discovery of the model which is  applied in mythic fashion to violence itself in nonmythic fashion to  natural phenomena The miracle of restored unanimity prompts the  conception of the model which is seen as a combination of natural and  cultural influences The human imagination has regularly reverted to it  on many and diverse occasions Even today we have not succeeded in  sorting the arbitrary from the nonarbitrary elements the useful from  the useless the significant from the insignificant This failure has been  particularly striking in the field of psychopathology   The obsessive concern during the seventeenth century with clysters  and bleedings with assuring the efficient evacuation of peccant hu mors shows plainly that the medical practices of that age were based  on the principle of expulsion and purification These practices consti tute in fact a slightly refined variant of the shamans approach with its  emphasis on the extraction of the physical katharma   It is easy to laugh with Moliere at quack doctors and their gar gantuan clysters but physical purging for better or for worse is a real  process And what about the modern practice of immunization and  inoculation The model is the same in both cases clearly its tech nique and theory can be applied to pseudodiscoveries as well as to real  ones The patients defenses according to modern theory must be  reinforced so that he can repulse a microbiotic invasion by his own  means The beneficent process is still conceived in terms of an invasion  repulsed a harmful intruder chased from the premises There is no  question of mockery here because the process is scientifically sound  The physician inoculates the patient with a minute amount of the dis ease just as in the course of the rites the community is injected with a  minute amount of violence enabling it to ward off an attack of full fledged violence The analogies abound Booster shots for instance     290 Violence and the Sacred   correspond to the repetition of sacrificial rites And of course in all  varieties of sacrificial protection there is always the danger of a  catastrophic inversion a too virulent vaccine a too powerful phar makon can promote the illness it was supposed to prevent In the first  chapter I used vaccination as a metaphor to illustrate certain aspects of  sacrifice Now we can see that vaccination like so many other human  institutions really amounts to a metaphorical displacement of sacrifice   K ONCE AGAIN WE ENCOUNTER a relic of the prim itive mind in modern scientific thinking a reflection of the imaginative  impulse set in motion by generative violence We discover that a tech nological tool of undisputed utility is not unrelated to the crudest sort  of ritualistic medicine Certainly we cannot claim that primitive prac tices stem from a mode of thought that is entirely different from our  own Of course there are differences certain substitutions take place  and there is a constant shifting of position as one mode of thought  merges with another However there is no reason to regard the vari ous results of these operations as separate entities for the process after  all consists by definition of a series of displacements analogous to those  that went before and those that are due to follow or due not to  follow in other words to a series of metaphorical substitutions that  owe their variety to the fact that none of them ever wholly succeeds in  reproducing the essence of a single unique process   If we wish to complete our picture of the various meanings of  katharsis we must return once more to Greek tragedy As yet I have  made no specific reference to Aristotles use of the term in his Poetics  It scarcely seems necessary to do so at this point for I have already  established that tragedy springs from mythic and ritual forms As for  the function of tragedy Aristotle has already defined it for us In  describing the tragic effect in terms of katharsis he asserts that tragedy  can and should assume at least some of the functions assigned to ritual  in a world where ritual has almost disappeared   As we have seen the tragic figure of Oedipus becomes the original  katharma Once upon a time a temple and an altar on which the victim  was sacrificed were substituted for the original act of collective vio lence now there is an amphitheater and a stage on which the fate of  the katharma played out by an actor will purge the spectators of their  passions and provoke a new katharsis both individual and collective  This katharsis will restore the health and wellbeing of the community   The unity of a given ritual says Victor Turner Li The Drums of  Affliction is a dramatic unity It is in this sense a work of art5 If we   5 Victor Turner The Drums of Affliction Oxford Qarendon Press 1968  p 269     The Unity of All Rites 291   agree with this opinionand it would be difficult to disagreethe  reverse should be true as well a given dramatic performance consti tutes a sort of rite the shadowy similitude of the religious experience   The Aristotelian use of katbarsis has provoked endless discussion and  will doubtless continue to do so Modern theorists seek to establish the  precise sense that the word had for the philosopher They brush aside  its religious implications because as they claim these implications were  no longer current in Aristotles timewere indeed hardly less ob scure then than they are today The modern inability to grasp the  nature of these implications makes it even harder to come to terms  with Aristotles use of the word   Yet in order for the term katharsis to assume a sacrificial character in  the Poetics it was not necessary for Aristotle to be aware of the orig inal operation Indeed his ignorance of that operation was almost a  requirement If tragedy was to function as a sort of ritual something  similar to a sacrificial killing had to be concealed in the dramatic and  literary use of katharsis just as it was concealed in the religious and  medical use of the term It is precisely because Aristotle failed to  penetrate the secret of sacrificial rites that his tragic katharsis ulti mately constitutes only another sacrificial displacement It takes its  rightful place among all the other displacements gravitating around  the generative violence that owes its enduring efficacy to its elusive ness   On closer inspection Aristotles text is something of a manual of  sacrificial practices for the qualities that make a good1 tragic hero are  precisely those required of the sacrificial victim If the latter is to  polarize and purge the emotions of the community he must at once  resemble the members of the community and differ from them he  must be at once insider and outsider both double and incarnation of  the sacred difference1 He must be neither wholly good nor wholly  bad A certain degree of goodness is required in the tragic hero in  order to establish sympathy between him and the audience yet a cer tain degree of weakness a tragic flaw is needed to neutralize the  goodness and permit the audience to tolerate the heros downfall and  death Freud touches upon this situation in Totem and Taboo but he  leaves the matter unresolved Having accompanied the hero part of the  way the audience suddenly perceives him as wholly other and aban dons him to his fate his superhuman ignominy and glory The specta tor may shudder with pity and fear but he must also feel a deep  sense of gratitude for his own orderly and relatively secure existence  Every true work of art might be said to partake of the initiatory  process in that it forces itself upon the emotions offers intimations of     292 Violence and the Sacred   violence and instills a respect for the power of violence that is it  promotes prudence and discourages hubris   Aristotle is discretely vague about which emotions tragedy is meant  to purge But if we see tragedy in terms of a fire used to combat fire it  is clear that its purpose is to protect the community against its own  violence The philosopher asserts that the only violence appropriate to  tragic action is violence between close relatives   If tragedy were a direct adaptation of rites as some erudite theoreti cians have claimed it would itself constitute a work of erudition and  its esthetic and kathartic potential would be in no way superior to that  of the Cambridge Ritualists If tragedy is or once was rich in kathar sis that can only be attributed to the antiritualistic aspects of its orig inal inspiration Tragedy advances toward the truth in the face of  reciprocal violence and while assuming the guise of reciprocal vio lence But it invariablv draws back at the last minute As soon as  mythical and ritualistic differences are seriously challenged they are  replaced by cultural and esthetic differences Tragedy thus shares  a fundamental experience with ritual Both have advanced to the very  brink of that terrible abyss wherein all differences disappear Both have  been permanently marked by the ordeal   If tragedy has a sacrificial character then it must possess a maleficent  aspecta Dionysiac aspect as Nietzsche would put itas well as a  beneficent regulatory Apollonian cultural role A parenthetic re mark on Nietszche although his classifications are manifestly superior  to the approaches of most critics they fail to perceive or at most  perceive only dimly that each and every divinity corresponds to both  aspects at once   The fundamental duality of tragedy led to the opposing formulations  of Aristotle and Plato Given his time and place Aristotle was correct  to define tragedy in terms of its cathartic qualities But then Aristotle  is always correct That is why he is so great and so onesided in his  greatness Aristotle is above and beyond the crisis of tragedy He  incorporates into his theory all the meanings and reasons that pertain  to the misunderstanding of this crisis In choosing xristode as their  mentor the formalistic literary critics could not have done better for  Aristotle views tragedy solely from the perspective of order In his  view the art of tragedy affirms consolidates and preserves everything  that deserves to be affirmed consolidated and preserved   Plato by contrast is closer in time and spirit to the crisis It is not  the stately affirmation of great cultural rites that he discerns in Oedipus  the Kwg but rather the undermining of differences Platos attention is  caught by tragic reciprocity by those very aspects that are always     The Unity of All Rites 293   eliminated by a formalistic or structuralist reading of the drama by all  those aspects in short that William Arrowsmith refers to as constitut ing the plays tragic turbulence6   Paradoxically it was Platos own acute insight into the nature of  tragic inspiration that provoked his hostility to drama He saw tragedy  as opening a window onto the dark and dangerous origins of social  values as somehow posing a challenge to the very concept of civic  order In Oedipus the King the publics attention is insidiously diverted  from the communitys efforts to rid itself of the pharmakos to the  pharmakos itself with whom the poet and poetry tend to side The  poet like many a modern intellectual reveals an ambiguous attitude  toward those beings whom the stricken city has driven from its pre cincts in an effort to regain its lost unity Even when he is not actually  espousing suspect causes the poet retells ancient timehonored legends  in a new way giving them a slightly impious and seditious ring The  city says Plato must protect itself from subversion therefore it must  rid itself of subversive elements Sophocles must join Oedipus on the  road to exile the poet too must become a pharmakos   This situation goes unperceived by rationalist and humanist critics  Their pursuit of what one might perhaps call the meaning of mean ings1 leads them away from the source of tragic inspiration and away  from undifferentiated violence By reinforcing and consolidating all  the differences they effectively close the interstices through which  violence and the sacred can pass They succeed so well that they man age to do away with any cathartic value the work might possess We  are left with platitudinous reflections on the works cultural values  or with pure erudition pure classification Such critics do not seem to  realize that by divorcing tragedy from the essential drama of mankind  from the conflict of war and peace and love and hate they are empty ing the work of its tragic substance and preparing a new swing of the  pendulum back to tragedy Nowhere in their works do we encounter  an adequate response to the genuine terror of such a work as The  Bacchae7   William Arrowsmith The Criticism of Greek Tragedy Tulane Drama  Review 3 no 3 1959   7 The methods whereby the humanistic tradition both ancient and modern  has managed to minimize and at times suppress the more horrific aspects of archaic  and classical Greek culture surely deserve close study As Henri Jeanmaire has  observed Diovysos pp 22830   The fact that this horrific aspect is only rarely alluded to by ancient authors  is not wholly fortuitous It is to the great glory of the Greeks that their  particular concept of religion and the gods as manifested primarily in their  literature art and philosophy served as a bulwark against that ancient fund  of cruelty inherent in most religions whose origins are sunk deep in the past  Those many myths that pertain all too clearly to human sacrifice myths     294 Violence and the Sacred   Any great writer puts critical platitudes to nought and reveals all  pronouncements about literature as shot through with ambiguities In  the preface to Samson Agonistes Milton lays emphasis on the paradoxi cal aspect of katharsis that though implicit in Aristotles theory is  rather muted The poet comments that a sickness and its cure are one  and the same thanks to the kindly intervention of nature But on  closer inspection natures model reveals as well as conceals the war ring doubles of tragedy who can be discerned in the works of Milton  and to some extent in all true dramatic poets   Tragedy as it was anciently composd hath been ever held the gravest  moralest and most profitable of all other Poems therefore said by  Aristotle to be of power by raising pity and fear or terror to purge  the mind of those and such like passions that is to temper and reduce  them to just measure with a kind of delight stirrd up by reading or   generally involving children or young girls suffice to remind us of the hard  reality of these barbarous antecedents But there is no concealing the fact that  as soon as one strays some slight distance from the main cultural centers traces  of these practices could be found usually in the form of local customs or  traditional rituals Sheer familiarity a lingering sense of shame ignorance of  what was going on in other regions and a reluctance to refer to matters that  contradicted the accepted ideal of Hellenism all combined to cast these events  into shadow The brutal treatment accorded the pkarmakoi poor creatures  used as scapegoats had been greatly reduced in ferocity by the time of Pericles  and Socrates and transformed into a sort of old popular custom Nonetheless  it could be assumed that things had once been quite different and on the  frontiers of Hellenism at Marseilles or Abdera one could still hear tell of  pbarmakoi being hurled into the sea or stoned to death   Trustworthy witnesses testify that as late as the fourth century religious  ceremonies on Mount Lyceum in Arcadia included acts of ritual cannibalism  involving the eating of an infants flesh   Such considerations can hardly do more than touch upon what is after all  a very complex problem but they should serve as a warning not to take too  lightly the information contained in certain Christian tracts even though  these accounts were written long after the event and derived from the writings  of local scholars who like the later Christian polemicists were also voicing  their aversion to blood sacrifice The accounts agree that human sacrifices  were made to Dionysus    Human sacrifices to Zeus were made at Lyctos  And it is interesting to note that Themistocles on the eve of Salamis is said  to have sacrificed two young Persians to Dionysus at an inland site on the  urging of a soothsayer The authenticity of this account is questionable be cause it is recorded so late and Herodotus silence hardly adds to its credi bility Yet the author of this story was well placed to inform himself on local  history and Herodotus reticence may in this case have been deliberate   It is not the least paradoxical aspect of our subjectthe traces of archaism  in the various cults of Dionysusthat even so abbreviated a treatment as the  one offered here can provide a useful introduction to the circumstances that  earned our god who had already acquired so many attributes and assumed  so many different forms although some of them are more closely connected  than has sometimes been thought the great good fortune of becoming the pa tron god of the Athenian theater and subsequently during the Hellenistic  period of the theater as a whole     The Unity of All Rites 295   seeing those passions well imitated Nor is Nature wanting in her own  effects to make good his assertion for so in Physic things of melancholic  hue and quality are usd against melancholy sowr against sowr salt to  remove salt humours   It is of course essential that we refrain from forcing all arguments  of the PlatoversusAristotle type into the uniform mold of moralistic  modernism we must resist that dangerous craving for differences that  prompts us rigidly to grade and categorize art philosophy politics   On the other hand we must not forget that any significant attitude  can be transmuted into a ritual The PlatoversusAristotle conflict is  no exception we have only to recall those neighboring communities  whose ritual systems reflected antithetical solutions to identical prob lemsthose communities for example in which incest is regarded  with horror and loathing and those in which it is an accepted ritualis tic practice We can compare Platos attitude to those ritual systems  that regard the evil aspects of nature as inexorably evil and do their  best to eliminate all trace of them from the community Plato found it  impossible to believe that tragic discord or tragic violence could ever  become synonyms for harmony and peace That is why he rejects with  horror those patricidal and incestuous impulses to which Aristotle and  Western culture in general not excluding the psychoanalysts assigned  a certain cultural value In our own day the Dionysiac orgy is simply  another form of academicism The most daring provocations and the  most shocking scandals have lost all power to provoke and shock That  does not mean that violence is no longer a threat quite the contrary  The sacrificial system is virtually worn out and that is why its inner  workings are now exposed to view   e4 WHENEVER WE THINK that a stable opposition or a  stable difference has been established we discover that the situation has  simply been inverted The Platonic rejection of tragic violence is itself  violent for it finds expression in a new expulsionthat of the poet  Through his very castigation of the poet Plato reveals himself the  poets enemy brother his double who like all true doubles is  oblivious to the relationship As regards Socrates whom the com munityunwilling to soil its hands by contact with an impious  creatureasked to do away with himself Platos sympathy is every bit  as suspect as Sophocles sympathy for his pharmakoshero Whenever a  people has embarked on a tragic course and this was as true for  classical Greece as it is for us today no heroes arise only antiheroes  The community to which everyone in turn adheres in opposition to  the enemy of the moment is betrayed by all just as Thebes was     296 Violence and the Sacred   betrayed by Oedipus and Tiresias Ultimately it is this antagonism that  causes the communitys death even or rather especially when its  defense or its socalled best interests serve to disguise and excuse the  unleashed violence   Tragedy holds up a mirror to mankind and what men saw reflected  in itthe inexorable decay of the polisprompted them to smash it  useless and vain though that gesture might be Staring back at these  double images we can appreciate the context in which tragedy took  place After all the same mocking images glitter before our own eyes  today   Philosophy like tragedy can at certain levels serve as an attempt at  expulsion an attempt perpetually renewed because never wholly suc cessful This point I think has been brilliantly demonstrated by  Jacques Derrida in his essay La Pharmacie de Platon8 He sets out to  analyze Platos use of the term pharmakon The Platonic pharmakon  functions like the human pharmakos and leads to similar results The  word is a pivot point between sophistic deception and sound philoso phy even though its role is no more justified or justifiable than the  violence inflicted on the human scapegoat led through the streets of  fair Athens just prior to his execution When Plato applies pharmakon  to the Sophists he generally uses it in its maleficent sense of poison  When it is applied to Socrates or any Socratic activity however it  means remedy Although Derrida refuses to do away with all differ ences or to treat these differences as null and void he demonstrates  that between Socrates and the Sophists the structure of the opposition  belies not the difference that Plato would like to establish but rather  the reciprocity that is suggested by the recourse to one and the same  wrord All difference in doctrines and attitudes is dissolved in violent  reciprocity is secretly undermined by the symmetry of the facts and  by the strangely revealing even somewhat naive use of pharmakon  This use polarizes the maleficent violence on a double who is arbi trarily expelled from the philosophic community From Plato right  down to Nietzsche who took a contrary stand the philosophic tradi tion has piously reaffirmed this absolute difference With Nietzsche the  difference was inverted and began to shift back and forthin prepara tion perhaps for its predestined elimination   Platos pharmakon is like Aristotles katharsis And whatever their  philosophic intentions may have been it was their literary intuition  that led these two men to select terms that seem suggestive but the full  pertinence of which may have escaped them In both cases the meta phor is used innocently in the sense that the misapprehension that   8 Jacques Derrida La Pharmacie de Platon in La Disseminatiofi Paris 1972  pp 71197     The Unity of All Rites 291   characterizes all sacrificial ceremonies is innocent In discovering as we  believe we have done that these metaphors and their respective objects  conceal the same process we have in effect discovered that the  metaphoric displacement ultimately alters nothing Behind the various  metaphors a scapegoat effect can always be discerned   Derridas analysis demonstrates in striking fashion a certain arbitrary  violence of the philosophic process as it occurs in Plato through the  mediation of a word that is indeed appropriate since it really designates  an earlier more brutal variant of the same arbitrary violence The long  line of sacrificial forms each derived from the other contains no  right form from the point of view of philosophy sociology or  psychoanalysis But it does contain one genuine unique event whose  essence is invariably betrayed to one degree or another by all the  translations and metaphoric derivations that Western thought has pro duced   Derrida proves that translations of Plato in modern languages man age to obliterate still further the final traces of the generative opera tion For the translations destroy the unity of the term pharniakony  they use entirely different words to render pharmakoiremcdy and  pharmak onpoison This same process of obliteration was discussed in  connection with Benvenistes Dictiomiaire des institutions iido europeennes   Sft  I N T H E C O L R S E o f t h i s w o r k  h a v e t r i e d t o demon strate that generative violence penetrates all forms of mythology and  ritual Yet by Chapter 8 which discussed Freuds Totem and Taboo it  was clear that the scope of this inquiry would have to be extended For  if the mechanism of the surrogate victim is simply another aspect of  the original mechanism of the symbolic process then there can be  nothing in the whole range of human culture that is not rooted in  violent unanimitynothing that does not find its source in the sur rogate victim That realization led me to turn my attention to various  cultural activities derived from ritual It is now time to enlarge the  theory in response to the previous findings   We are now moving toward an expanded concept of sacrifice in  which the sacrificial act in the narrow sense plays only a minor part If  I wish to show that this enlargement of my theory is not arbitrary I  must demonstrate that in those localities where ritual killing no longer  occurs or where there is no evidence of its ever having occurred its  place has been taken by another institution also directly linked to  generative violence I have in mind a society like our own or one  belonging to late antiquity   In Chapter 11 suggested that there was a direct correlation between     298 Violence and the Sacred   the elimination of sacrificial practices and the establishment of a judi cial system That discussion however preceded the discovery of the  surrogate victim Consequently it was not firmly rooted in generative  unanimity and now appears inconclusive   We must endeavor to fill this breach For if it cannot be proven that  the penal system owes its origins to generative violence it might well  be maintained that the judicial system is based on rational agreement  on a sort of social contract and that men are indeed able to master  their social environment in the direct and explicit way that rationalists  conceive Such a conclusion would flatly contradict my line of argu ment   Louis Gernet takes up the subject of capital punishment in his  Anthropologic de la Grece antique In his discussion the link between  punishment and the surrogate victim can be readily discerned Capital  punishment takes two seeminglv separate forms the first purely reli gious and the second purely secular In the first instance   The death penalty is a means of eliminating pollution    It purifies the  affected group who are often partly or wholly absolved of responsibility  for the newly spilt blood this is true at any rate in the case of lapida tion The violent expulsion the expulsion unto death of the unworthy  or accursed individual has an ancillary sense that of devotio Indeed the  killing seems in one sense to be an act of piety It makes us think of those  ancient ordinances which declare that the murder of an outlaw does not  cause pollution or of that prescription of Germanic law that makes such  killing a civic duty    Then too the victim himself fills a true religious  function a function parallel to the priestkings who are also put to death  The religious function can be seen in the Latin term for these victims  homo sacer as well as in the Greek term pharmakos   There is no doubt that the death penalty is portrayed here as a direct  extension of generative violence   Gernet also makes reference to another form of punishment the  public exposure of criminals The exposure was sometimes accom panied by a procession through the streets of the community Gernet  cites Georges Glotz who compares this procession to katharma rites  and links it to Platos suggestion that in his model state criminals  should be publically displayed    at the frontiers of the country  Laws 855c Glotz considers this mention of frontiers significant his  reasons lead us back to our own preoccupation with the surrogate  victim and its byproducts One of the tendencies that manifests itself  in religious approaches to punishment is that of elimination and more   9 Louis Gernet Sur Texecution capitale in Anthropologic de la Grece antique  Paris 1968 pp 32627     The Unity of All Rites 299   particularlyfor the word must be taken in its etymological senseof  expulsion beyond the frontiers The bones of the sacrilegious dead are  cast out of the community andthis is a wellknown religious prac tice mentioned by Platothe inanimate object that caused a mans  death or the corpse of an animal that killed a person is also subject to  expulsion10   The second type of capital punishment was accomplished with the  minimum of formalities and is devoid of religious connotations It is an  apagogey its rough and ready character might remind us of the frontier  justice of xmerican Westerns According to Gernet it was usually  visited on criminals who had been caught in the act and it was always  ratified by the common accord of the community However says  Gernet the public nature of these acts would not have been enough to  make the execution of the criminals possible if these criminals had not  usually been foreigners that is individuals whose death entailed no  risk of endless revenge within the community   The second type of capital punishment is very different from the  first in formor rather in lack of form Nevertheless the two are  related If we acknowledge the role of the surrogate victim in the  genesis of religious forms we cannot regard them as independent insti tutions Generative unanimity operates in both cases In the first type  it perpetrates capital punishment by means of ritual in the second type  generative unanimity makes an actual appearanceadmittedly in di luted and degenerate form otherwise its appearance would not be  possible but savagely and spontaneously nonetheless This latter  mode of unanimity gradually evolves into what can perhaps be de scribed as an institutionalized and legalized form of mob violence   In neither case can the concept of legal punishment be divorced  from its original impulse The concept can be traced back to sponta neous unanimity to the irresistible conviction that compels an entire  community to vent its fury on a single individual Legal punishment  thus has an aleatory character readily recognizable in the numerous  intermediary forms between the religious and judicial spheres notably  in the case of the ordeal by fire water single combat etc    Q    AS WE BRING TOGETHER the various elements of  our discussion only one conclusion seems possible There is a unity  that underlies not only all mythologies and rituals but the whole of  human culture and this unity of unities depends on a single mech anism continually functioning because perpetually misunderstood   10G Glotz Solidarite de la famille dans le droit criminel p 25 Cited in  Gernet Quelques rapports entre la penalite et la religion dans la Grece ancienne  Anthropologic de la Grece antique pp 28990     300 Violence and the Sacred   the mechanism that assures the communitys spontaneous and  unanimous outburst of opposition to the surrogate victim   Such a conclusion may strike some as extreme not to say extrava gant It might well be useful at this point to review the analytical  approach on which it is based We need one more examplean exam ple that will demonstrate the unity of all sacrificial rites as well as the  continuity from these rites to other cultural phenomena that seem at  first glance utterly alien to them I have attempted to choose an ex ample that appears essential to the structure of human society the  institution of monarchymonarchy as it pertains to sovereigns as well  as to political power in general and to the whole idea of central au thority   The discussion of African monarchies has alreadv shown that isolat ing ritual incest the most sensational aspect of those monarchies can  only lead us astray We cannot treat ritual incest as an independent  phenomenon but must keep our sights fixed on the sacrifice even if the  sacrificial rites seem dull and ordinary in comparison with ritual incest   Sacrifice is the most crucial and fundamental of rites it is also the  most commonplace and that is why it sometimes changes form or  disappears in the course of the evolution of any given ceremony So  ritual forms are mutilated even before they reach those modern inter preters usually eager to further minimize disregard and efface the  last traces of generative violence   The more peculiar a cultural element appears and the more distinc tive its character the more it tends to distract us from essentials unless  we take care to place it in its proper context It is the commonplace  that truly deserves our attention for the most frequendy encountered  cultural elements are the ones most likely to lead us to the truth   We have already seen how two variants of the same ritual can stand  in opposition for example the festival and what I have called the  antifestival or the requiring and prohibition of royal incest Such op positions stem from different interpretations of the sacrificial crisis  Even if the rite takes into account the basic connection between malefi cent and beneficent violence it still attempts to establish differences  between them for practical purposesdifferences that can never be  anything but arbitrary since the beneficial reversal only occurs as a  result of the maleficent paroxysm and is in a sense produced by it   We have also observed that the striking variation among rites in any  given geographical area is far less important than it seems at first  glance One has no right to find great significance in one tribes pre scription of royal incest and a neighboring tribes proscription of it or  to conclude from this difference that one tribe is more timid and  fearful the other more daring and liberated     The Unity of All Rites 301   The same principle holds true for broad categories of rites their  autonomy is only an illusion The inability of religious thought to  understand correctly the violent mechanism of its own genesis gives  rise to countless interpretations that can all be different from each  other because they are all erroneous these interpretations are the ritu als and myths of all human societies the world over   It does not seem to have occurred to modern theorists bound as  they are to their own methodologies to draw together such disparate  institutions as the African monarchies the cannibalistic rites of the  Tupinamba and the sacrificial ceremonies of the Aztecs However  each of these institutions casts light on the other   In the Aztec rites a certain time elapses between the election of the  victim and his execution During this time every effort is made to  gratify his desires The people prostrate themselves before him fight  for the privilege of touching his garments He is treated like a king  almost like a god Yet this reverential treatment ends in brutal murder   The Tupinamba prisoner shares certain similarities with the Aztec  victim and the African king In each case the victims situation com bines grandeur and misery veneration and ignominy There is the  same combination of positive and negative elements though in some what different proportions   These analogies are too limited and vague however to constitute a  solid basis for comparison For instance the ephemeral honors ac corded the Aztec victim cannot really be compared to the solid politi cal power enjoyed by the African king As for the Tupinamba  prisoner it would be stretching a point to call his position regal Our  attempt to bring these three cases together may seem all the more  audacious when one considers that their similarities even when clearly  distinguishable have nothing to do with the most conspicuous features  of each institution ritual incest for the African kings cannibalism for  the Tupinamba human sacrifice for the Aztecs These are notable  ethnological landmarks and my treatment of them might well seem  sheer willfulness and impressionism a reversion to the methods of  Frazer or Robertson Smitheven though in this instance the syn chronic groupings established by modern scholars working in the field  have been taken into consideration   At this point the prudent ethnographer might think it is advisable to  hold fast the doctrine that a king is a king and a victim is a victim in  the same way that a cat is indubitably a cat That some kings are  sacrificed and some victims are treated like kings is interesting but  nothing more an amusing paradox that can be exploited by literary  folk but that has nothing to do with science   So prudent an attitude may not be very satisfying but in the absence     of any unifying theory it remains unavoidable However everything  changes once we begin to realize that the various scapegoat phe nomena are not the reflection of some illarticulated guilt complex but  rather the very basis of cultural unification the source of all rituals and  religion Seen in this light the differences between these three ritual  institutions do not appear so great they should not be assimilated to  the sort of difference that separates carbon monoxide and sodium sul fate The differences are due to the three different ways in which three  societies look at the same process the loss and subsequent recovery  of social unity We can now furnish explanations for the strange privi leges accorded the Tupinamba prisoner and the ephemeral adoration  offered the Aztec victim and we can also glimpse the meaning of the  shape of these rites and reaffirm their fundamental unity   If my analysis still leaves the reader skeptical if he is still troubled  by the differences between the three rituals we can show that many  intermediary ritual forms exist that cast doubt upon the apparent  specificity of the forms most distant from each other Many societies  have kings but it is no longer the king who is the sacrificial victim  Nor is it an animal The victim is a human being who stands in for the  king he is often chosen from a category of criminals social misfits or  classless creatures like the Greek pharmakos Before replacing the real  king on the sacrificial altar the mock king replaces him briefly on the  throne The brevity of the reign its lack of any real power recalls the  Aztec rite but the general context is that of true monarchy At this  point the difference between the African king and the Aztec victim  begins to blur for we have here a victim who belongs as much to one  rite as to the other a victim who is exactly situated between the two   On the other hand it should be noted that the mock king reigns over  a festival that is brought to a proper sacrificial conclusion by his own  death The theme of festival and the theme of sacrifice of a true or  simulated king are closely associatedfor instance in the Swazi  Incwalaand this is hardly surprising for the festival is nothing more  than a reenactrnent of the sacrificial crisis or rather of its resolution by  means of the surrogate victim Whenever the restoration of unity is  personally attributed to the surrogate victim he is seen as divine  royal sovereign The words used to designate himking sover eign divinity scapegoatare nothing more than metaphors used in  conjunction with other metaphors Their purpose is to recapture the  original act of generative unanimity and they are all different because  they never entirely succeed   In any ritual interpretation of the primordial event there is always  one dominant element that overshadows the others and finally obscures     The Unity of All Rites 303   them as the memory of the generative violence fades from the collec tive consciousness In the festival this dominant element is the joyous  celebration of a partially transformed sacrificial crisis In time as we  have seen the concluding sacrifice is eliminated as are the rites of  exorcism that accompany the sacrifice or replace it When all vestiges  of the generative violence have been removed we are left with a  festival in the modern sense This is the only kind of festival familiar  to the cultural historian and recognizable by him yet he must under stand its ritual origins in order to understand its evolution   The greater vitality these rites possess and the closer they are to  their common origin the more futile becomes any attempt at classifica tion Of course difference pervaded these rites from the beginning for  the principal function of the surrogate victim is to restore and solidify  difference but at the outset differentiation remains circumscribed and  limited it has not yet begun to proliferate   The rite constitutes the original interpretation of the generative vio lence It sets up an initial imbalance between the reciprocal aspects of  the sacred between the maleficent and beneficent elements With the  passage of time this imbalance becomes greater and greater the feature  that was originally given prominence relegates all the other features to  the background and finally banishes them altogether At this point the  rational viewer might well conclude that any connection between the  maleficent and the beneficent elements is a logical contradiction and  therefore unworthy of consideration A choice it seems must be  made between the accented and unaccented elements the contin ued impoverishment of the latter prompts the rational observer to  dismiss them as superfluous appendages introduced into the rite by  mistake Wherever contradictions still exist reason insists that we do  away with them The moment comes when we find ourselves con fronting two institutions that appear wholly unrelated The whole  thrust of Western thought with its insistence on differences prevents  us from perceiving their fundamental unity So firmly entrenched is  this habit of thought that this effort to uncover the common origins of  all rites will be misunderstood by many people as my own inability to  differentiate between them   Royal incest is not truly essential to the African concept of mon archy either from the point of view of origins in which it is subordi nated to sacrifice or from the point of view of evolution of passage  into the monarchal institution What is essential is the granting of  authority during his lifetime to someone who is designated as a future  victim and who draws his power and prestige retroactively from the  reconciling power of the original scapegoat With the passage of time     304 Violence and the Sacred   the substitute victims authority becomes more durable more stable  the factors opposing it lose their importance and another victim  human or animal is substituted for the king Everything that has to do  with the reverse side of supreme authoritywrongdoing and humilia tion maleficent violence and sacrificial punishmentbecomes merely  symbolic and soon disappears from view The vestiges of ritual are  like traces of chrysalis clinging to an insect they are soon discarded  Sacred royalty is transformed into royalty pure and simple into politi cal power   When we consider the monarchy of the Ancieri Regime in France  or any other traditional monarchic system we cannot help wondering  whether it would not be more profitable to consider these institutions  in the light of sacred kingship than in the light of modern ideas about  monarchy The concept of Divine Right is not just a fiction made up  on the spur of the moment to keep the king s subjects in line The life  and death of the monarchic concept in Franceits sacred rites its  fools its cure of scrofula through the royal touch the grand finale of  the guillotineall this is clearly structured by the influence of sacred  violence The sacred character of the kingthat is his identity with  the victimregains its potency as it is obscured from view and even  held up to ridicule It is in fact then that the king is most threatened   The master of these paradoxes the most daringly perspicacious in terpreter of the monarchic principle in a world not so far removed  from our own is Shakespeare He bridges the gap between the most  primitive concepts of kingship and the most modern he seems to have  been better acquainted with both than we are with either   The dethronement scene in Richard II can be seen as a sort of  coronation performed in reverse Walter Pater described it as an in verted rite11 but all rites demand that moment of inversion The king  acts as his own sacrificer transforming himself by quasireligious  means into a double of all his enemies and their surrogate victims as  well He is himself a traitor in no way different from those who do  him violence   Mine eyes are full of tears I cannot see   But they can see a sort of traitors here  Nay if I turn mine eyes upon myself  I find myself a traitor with the rest  For I have given here my souls consent  Tundeck the pompous body of a king  51244   n Walter Pater Appreciations London 1957 p 205     The Unity of All Rites 305   In his study of the duality of the kings person as portrayed in legal  documents of the Middle Ages The Kings Tivo Bodies Ernst  Kantorowicz undertakes an analysis of Richard 11 Although he does  not touch directly upon the question of the surrogate victim he gives  an excellent description of the dual nature of the Shakespearean mon arch   The duplications all one and all simultaneously active in Richard  Thus play I in one person many people 55 31are those potentially  present in the King the Fool and the God They dissolve perforce in  the Mirror Those three prototypes of twinbirth intersect

scene 41  with Mans wretchedness as a perpetual companion and antithesis at  every stage Moreover in each one of those three scenes we encounter  the same cascading from divine kingship to kingships Name and from  the name to the naked misery of man12   We may go a little further and ask ourselves whether this descrip tion does not transcend the subject of monarchy strictly conceived to  embrace broader concepts of sovereignty and indeed all forms of  central power that owe their existence to the surrogate victim There  are perhaps two fundamental types of society which overlap to some  extent those having a central authority essentially monarchal in char acter and those having no such authority disclosing no trace of genera tive violence in their political institutionsthe socalled dual systems  The first group for reasons unknown to us tends to cluster around a  single representative of the original victim an individual whose status  is more or less permanent who concentrates political as well as reli gious power in himself Even if this power is subsequently fragmented  the tendency toward centralism persists   It is worth noting that structuralist ethnology shows little interest in  those societies that no longer reveal any significant opposition between  dual forces In this instance the opposition between the two ex tremes has been interiorized It can indeed find exterior expression  in the conflict between king and fool for examplebut this always  seems like an afterthought a development of secondary importance   The unstable character of historical0 societies is perhaps reflected  in this royal interiorization in each one of us this play of differences  undifferentiation and scapegoating in each one of us which encour ages tragedians to treat the

by an unend ing vacillation of differences   Q93 ALL RELIGIOUS RITUALS SPRING from the surro gate victim and all the great institutions of mankind both secular and  religious spring from ritual Such is the case as we have seen with  political power legal institutions medicine the theater philosophy  and anthropology itself It could hardly be otherwise for the working  basis of human thought the process of symbolization is rooted in  the surrogate victim Even if no example taken alone offers conclusive  proof of my theory their cumulative effect is overwhelming all the  more so because they coincide with archetypal myths that tell in  apparently naive fashion how all mans religious familial economic  and social institutions grew out of the body of an original victim  The surrogate victim as founder of the rite appears as the ideal educa tor of humanity in the etymological sense of educatio a leading out  The rite gradually leads men away from the sacred it permits them  to escape their own violence removes them from violence and be stows on them all the institutions and beliefs that define their humanity   In the great Indian texts dealing with sacrifice we discover the same  content though in slightly different form as in the origin myths   In the beginning the gods sacrificed a man when he was killed his  ritualistic virtues deserted him They entered a horse the gods sacrificed  the horse when it was killed its ritualistic virtues deserted it They  entered a cow the gods sacrificed the cow when it was killed its  ritualistic virtues deserted it They entered a sheep the gods sacrificed  the sheep when it was killed its ritualistic virtues deserted it They  entered a goat the gods sacrificed the goat When it was killed its  ritualistic virtues deserted it and entered the earth The gods dug for  them and found them in the form of rice and barley And that is why  today we still dig the earth to procure rice and barley13   Durkheim asserts that society is of a piece and that the primary  unifying factor is religion His statement is not a truism nor does it  dissolve religion in social institutions Durkheim believes that men are  shaped culturally by an educational process that belongs to the sphere  of religion Even concepts of space and time he says stem from reli gion Durkheim never fully articulated his insight for he never re alized what a formidable obstacle violence presents and what a positive  resource it becomes when it is transfigured and reconverted through  the mediation of scapegoat effects   Human society does not begin with the fear of the slave for the   3 GatapathaBrahmana 1 2 3 67 in Sylvain Levi La Doctrine du sacrifice  dans les Bralymanas Paris 1966 pp 13657     The Unity of All Rites 507   master as Hegel claims butas Durkheim maintainswith religion  To carry Durkheims insight to its conclusion I will add that religion  is simply another term for the surrogate victim who reconciles  mimetic oppositions and assigns a sacrificial goal to the mimetic im pulse At the moment when differentiated unity is urgently needed and  apparently impossible to obtainthat is during an outburst of re ciprocal violencethe surrogate victim comes to the rescue   The role of the surrogate victim can be ascertained I believe even  on a spatial plane There is good reason to think that it has imposed its  image on the very structures of some communities at those special  locations forming the center of the community sites generally dedi cated to the spirit of collective unity and whose true nature is some times brought to light through archaeological investigation   In Greece these sites include the tombs of heroes the omphalos the  stone of the agora and finally that perfect symbol of the polis Hestia  the common hearth Louis Gernefs essay on these sites leaves this  reader at least with the overwhelming conviction that these are places  where the surrogate victim met his death or where he was believed to  have died   The traditions attached to these localities and the ritualistic func tions associated with them lend credence to the theory that sacred mob  violence formed the origin of the polis This mob violence can take the  form of the Bouphonia which we have referred to on several occa sions or it can take the form of the public exposure of criminals or  other punishments that recall the pharmakos Further research along  the lines of the surrogate victim would undoubtedly turn up even  more conclusive evidence   There is reason to believe that these symbolic sites of unification  gave birth to all religious forms it was there that the various cults  were established spatial relationships fixed the clock of history set in  motion and the beginnings of a social life plotted out precisely as  Durkheim envisioned it There everything begins from there every thing emanates there everything returns when discord breaks out  Surely that is the point of the only direct quotation we have of  Anaximander the earliest voice of Western thought I would like to  repeat those astonishing words here to show that such a claim is not  unbelievable   In the evolution from ritual to secular institutions men gradually  draw away from violence and eventually lose sight of it but an actual  break with violence never takes place That is why violence can always  stage a stunning catastrophic comeback The possibility of such an  occurrence conforms to the dire predictions of divine vengeance that  are to be found in every religious system His rejection of this     308 Violence and the Sacred   apocalyptic message explains why Heidegger has rejected the tradi tional translation of Anaximanders words But it seems to me that he  has missed the point completely for the vengeance Anaximander al ludes to is wholly human not divine in other words not mythic I  shall revert therefore to the more traditional translation of Anaxi mander which Heidegger went out of his way to criticize but which  seems to me marvelously apposite   Where things are born there too must they perish for each in turn  metes out punishment and expiation for its wickedness each in the  allotted time14   14 Cf Heidegger The Anaximander Fragment in Early Greek Thinking  trans David Farrell Krell and Frank A Capuzzi New York 1975     Conclusion   e   3  j  A THEORY OF THE NATURE of primitive religion     W  has emerged from the foregoing inquiry into the origins   of myth and ritual No attempt will be made here to consider the  JudaeoChristian texts in the light of this theory or vice versa that  must be left to a future study However I hope to have suggested here  the course that such a project might take   My theory depends on a number of basic premises Even if innumer able intermediary stages exist between the spontaneous outbursts of  violence and its religious imitations even if it is only these imitations  that come to our notice I want to stress that these imitations had their  origin in a real event The actuality of this event over and above its  existence in rite and record must be kept in mind We must also take  care not to restrict this event to any one context any one dominant  intellectual framework whether semantic or symbolic which lacks a  firm basis in reality The event should be viewed as an absolute begin ning signifying the passage from nonhuman to human as well as a  relative beginning for the societies in question   The theory of the surrogate victim is paradoxical in that it is based  on facts whose empirical characteristics are not directly accessible  These facts can be drawn exclusively from texts that invariably offer  distorted fragmentary or indirect testimony We can only gain access  to the generative event through constant reference to these enigmatic  sources which constitute at once the foreground in which our theory  situates itself and the background against which its accuracy must be  tested   The theory of evolution depends on the comparison and linkage of  evidencethe fossil remains of living creaturescorresponding in the  case of my hypothesis to religious and cultural texts N o single ana tomical fact studied in isolation can lead to the concept of evolution  No direct observation is possible no form of empirical verification  even conceivable because evolution occurred over a span of time en tirely out of scale with the span of human existence   In the same way no single textmythic religious or tragicwill  yield the operating procedures of violent unanimity Here too the   309     310 Violence and the Sacred   comparative method is the only one possible If this method has not  been successful to date that is because there are so many variables at  work it is hard to locate the single underlying scheme that controls  them all The theory of evolution toor constitutes a hypothesis   The surrogate victim theory presents as a theory a distinct superi ority over the theory of evolution The inaccessible character of the  generative event is not merely an obstacle unrelated to the theory an  aspect that contributes nothing of positive value rather it is an essen tial part of that theory something we cannot do without In order to  retain its structuring influence the generative violence must remain  hidden misapprehension is indispensable to all religious or postreligious  structuring And the hidden nature of the event corresponds to the  researchers inability to attribute a satisfactory function to religious  practices My theory is the first to offer an explanation of the primor dial role that religion plays in primitive societies as well as of mans  ignorance of this role   This hidden nature is much less problematic than a notion like the  unconscious of Freud A comparison of certain myths and rituals  viewed in the light of Greek tragedy leads to the theory of the sur rogate victim and violent unanimity through a path much more direct  than that of verbal slips to such psychoanalytic concepts as sup pressed desires and the unconscious Surely such slips can be attributed  to many different causes But the surrogate victim theory is the only  hypothesis that accounts for all features of the cultural phenomena  presented here Ujilike the psychoanalytical explanations it leaves no  areas in shadow and neglects no major aspects   Although generative violence is invisible it can logically be deduced  from myths and rituals once their real structures have been perceived  The further one advances along this path and the more transparent the  true nature of religious thought appears the clearer it becomes that  there is nothing here to suppress or to hide There is no justification  for the idea that religious thought either represses or deliberately  refuses to acknowledge a threatening selfawareness Such awareness  does not yet present any threat to religion It is we who are threatened  by it we who flee from it   If religious misapprehensions were to be regarded in the same light  as psychoanalysis regards its material we should require some religious  equivalent to the Freudian repression of the patricideincest desire  something that must be hidden and kept hidden Yet such is hardly the  case To be sure there are many details of the generative event that  have dropped out many elements that have become so warped mis shapen and transfigured as to be unrecognizable when reproduced in  mythical or ritualistic form Yet no matter how gaping the lacunae     Conclusion 311   may appear no matter how grotesque the deformations they are not  ultimately indispensable to the religious attitude the religious misap prehension Even if it were brought face to face with the inner work ings of the mechanism the religious mind would be unable to conceive  of the transformation of bad into good of violence into culture as a  spontaneous phenomenon calling for a positive approach   It is natural to assume that the bestconcealed aspect of the genera tive mechanism will be the most crucial element the one most likely to  render the sacrificial svstem nonfunctional if it becomes known This  aspect will be the arbitrary selection of the victim its essential insignifi cance which contradicts the meaning accumulated upon its head by  the scapegoat projections   Close examination will reveal that even this aspect is not really hid den it can be readily detected once we know what we must look for  Frequently the rituals themselves are engineered so that they include  an element of chance in the choice of the victim but mythologists  have never taken this into account   Although we have already called attention to those rites designed to  give a role to chance in the selection of the victim it may be that we  have not put sufficient stress on this essential aspect   Sporting contests and games of chance appear to modern man most  incongruous as ritual practices The Uitoto Indians for example in corporate a balloon game into their ritual and the Kayans of Borneo  use a top in the course of their religious ceremonies   Even more remarkable apparently even more incongruous is the  game of dice that figures in the funeral rites of the Canelos Indians  Only the men participate in this game Divided into two rival groups  and lined up on either side of the deceased they take turns casting  their dice over the corpse The sacred spirit in the person of the dead  man determines the outcome of each throw The winner is awarded  one of the dead mans domestic animals which is slaughtered on the  spot and the women prepare a meal from it for the assembled mourn ers   Jensen in citing these facts remarks that the games are not simply  additions to established religious practices1 If one were to say that the  Canelos Indians play at dice during the funeral rites of their parents  one would be conveying the wrong idea of the ceremonies For this  game takes place only in conjunction with these funeral rites It is  modern man who thinks of games of this sort as exclusively secular  and we must not project that idea onto the Canelos Indians This is not  to say that our own games have nothing to do with rites in fact they   1 Jensen Mythes et cultes chez les peuples primitifs pp 7783     312 Violence and the Sacred   originate in rites But as usual we have got things reversed For us  games of chance are a secular activity upon which a religious meaning  has been superimposed The true state of affairs is precisely the oppo site games originate in rites that have been divested to a greater oi  lesser degree of their sacred character As I have already remarked  Huizingas famous theory of play should be inverted It is not play that  envelops the sacred but the sacred that envelops the notion of play   Death like any passage entails violence The passage into the be yond by a member of the community may provoke among other  difficulties quarrels among the survivors for there is always the prob lem of how to redistribute the dead mans belongings In order to meet  the threat of maleficent contagion the community must have recourse  to the universal model to generative violence it must attend to the  advice of the sacred itself In this particular case the community ha  perceived and retained the role of chance in the liberating decision II  violence is given free play chance alone is responsible for the ultimate  resolution of the conflict and the rite tries to force the hand of chance  before violence has had the opportunity to act The rite aims straight  at the final result achieving as it were a minimum expenditure ol  violence   The Canelos dice game offers a clue to the reason why the theme oi  chance recurs so frequently in folklore myth and fable Oedipus ii  will be remembered refers to himself as the son of Tychethat is  Fortune or Chance There were towns in the ancient world in whicl  the selection of magistrates was made by drawing lots for the powe  bestowed by ritually regulated chance always contains a sacred ele  ment the sacred fusion of opposites Indeed the more we reflect oi  this theme of Chance the more universal it appears In popular legem  and fairy tale Chance is often invoked to find kings or conversely  and the converse is always the other face of the same coin to desig  nate someone to undertake a difficult or perilous mission a mission tha  might involve selfsacrifice for the general goodsomeone in short t  assume the role of surrogate victim   On tirata la courte paille  Pour savoir qui serait mange2   Yet is there any way of proving that the motif of Chance has it  origin in the arbitrary nature of the violent resolution There ar  numerous instances in wrhich the drawing of lots so clearly support  the meaning proposed here that it is virtually impossible to doubt th  connection One such example is the Old Testament Book of Jonal  God tells Jonah to go forth and warn the people of Nineveh that thei   2 From  etait un petit navire folkloric French song ed     Conclusion 313   city will be destroyed if they do not repent of their ways Hoping to  evade this thankless task the reluctant prophet embarks on a ship  sailing forTarshish   But the Lord sent out a great wind into the sea and there was a mighty  tempest in the sea so that the ship was like to be broken   Then the mariners were afraid and cried every man unto his god and  cast forth the wares that were in the ship into the sea to lighten it of  them But Jonah was gone down into the sides of the ship and he lay  and was fast asleep   So the shipmaster came to him and said unto him What meanest  thou O sleeper Arise call upon thy God if so be that God will think  upon us that we perish not   And they said every one to his fellow Come and let us cast lots that  we may know for whose cause this evil is upon us So they cast lots and  the lot fell upon Jonah   Jonah 147   The ship represents the community the tempest the sacrificial crisis  The jettisoned cargo is the cultural system that has abandoned its  distinctions The fact that everybody calls out to his own particular  god indicates a breakdown in the religious order The floundering ship  can be compared to the city of Nineveh threatened with destruction  unless its people repent The forms may vary but the crisis is always  the same   The passengers cast lots to determine wrho is responsible for the  crisis Chance can always be trusted to reveal the truth for it reflects  the will of the divinity The lot designates Jonah who proceeds to  confess his culpability   Then the men were exceedingly afraid and said unto him Why hast  thou done this For the men knew that he fled from the presence of the  Lord because he had told them   Then they said unto him What shall we do unto thee that the sea  may be calm unto us for the sea wrought and was tempestuous   And he said unto them Take me up and cast me forth into the sea  so shall the sea be calm unto you for I know that for my sake this  great tempest is upon you   Jonah 11012   The sailors attempt to gain the shore by their own efforts they  would like to save Jonahs life But they finally recognize the futility  of their efforts and address themselves to the Lordeven though he is  Jonahs Lord and not their own   Wherefore they cried unto the Lord and said W e beseech thee  0 Lord we beseech thee let us not perish for this mans life and lay     314 Violence and the Sacred   not upon us innocent blood for thou O Lord hast done as it pleased  thee   So they took up Jonah and cast him forth into the sea and the sea  ceased from her raging   Then the men feared the Lord exceedingly and offered a sacrifice unto  the Lord and made vows   Jonah 11416   What we see here is a reflection of the sacrificial crisis and its resolu tion The victim is chosen by lot his expulsion saves the community  as represented by the ships crew and a new god is acknowledged  through the crews sacrifice to the Lord whom they did not know  before Taken in isolation this story tells us little but when seen  against the backdrop of our whole discussion each detail acquires sig nificance   Modern man flatly rejects the notion that Chance is the reflection of  divine will Primitive man views things differently For him Chance  embodies all the obvious characteristics of the sacred Now it deals  violently with man now it showers him with gifts Indeed what is  more capricious in its favors than Chance more susceptible to those  rapid reversals of temper that are invariably associated with the gods   The sacred nature of Chance is reflected in the practice of the lot tery In some sacrificial rites the choice of victim by means of a lottery  serves to underline the relationship between Chance and generative  violence In an essay entitled uSur le symbolisme politique le Foyer  commun Louis Gernet cites a particularly revealing ritual which  took place in Cos during a festival dedicated to Zeus   The choice of victim was determined by a sort of lottery in which all  the cattle which were originally presented separately by each division of  each tribe were mixed together in a common herd The animal ultimately  selected was executed on the following day having first been intro duced to Hestia and undergone various rites Immediately prior to the  ritual presentation Hestia herself receives homage in the form of an  animal sacrifice3   At the close of the previous chapter I noted that Hestia the com mon hearth in all probability marked the place where the original act  of communal violence was perpetrated It seems more than likely  therefore that the selection of the victim by lottery was meant to  simulate that original violence The selection is not made by men but  left to divine Chance acting through violence The mixing together of  the cattle that had originally been identified by tribe or by division of   3 Gernet Anthropologic de la Grece antique p 393     Conclusion SIS   tribe is particularly revealing This deliberate confusion of distinctions  this merger into a communal togetherness constitutes an obligatory  preamble to the lottery clearly it was introduced to reproduce the  exact order of the original events The arbitrary and violent resolution  that serves as a model for the lottery takes place at the very height of  the sacrificial crisis when the distinctions delegated to the members of  society by the cultural order succumb to the reciprocal violence and  are merged into a communal mass   Q A TRADITIONAL DISCUSSION of Dionysus involves  a demonstration of how he differs from Apollo or from the other gods  But is it not more urgent to show how Dionysus and Apollo share the  same characteristics why the one and the other should be called di vine Surely all the gods despite their differences have something in  common something from which all their distinctive qualities spring  Without such a common basis the differences become meaningless   Scholars of religion devote themselves to the study of gods and  divinity They should be able to provide clear and concise definitions  of these concepts but they do not They are obliged of course to  decide what falls within their field of study and what falls outside it  yet they leave the crucial and most decisively scientific task of defining  their subject to uninformed public opinion Eren assuming that it is  possibleor justifiableto stretch the concept of divinity to include  each and everybodys idea of the divine the socalled science of reli gion can neither do without this approach nor provide a convincing  defense of it   There is no true science of religion any more than there is a science  of culture Scholars are still disputing about which cult Greek tragedy  should be ascribed to Were the ancients correct in assigning tragedy  to Dionysus or does it rightfully belong to another god Undoubtedly  this is a genuine problem but it is also I think a secondary one Far  more important but far less discussed is the relationship between trag edy and the divine between the theater in general and religion   Whether my theory proves to be true or false it can I believe lay  claim to being scientific if only because it allows for a rigorous  definition of such terms as divinity ritual rite and religion Any  phenomenon associated with the acts of remembering commemorat ing and perpetuating a unanimity that springs from the murder of a  surrogate victim can be termed religious   The surrogate victim theory avoids at once the impressionism of the  positivist approach and the arbitrary and reductivist schemata of  psychoanalysis Although this theory brings together many crucial     316 Violence and the Sacred   aspects of mans experience it offers no simple substitute for the  wondrous profusion of the worlds religious systems Indeed one  ought perhaps to ask whether this profusion is really as wondrous as  all that in any case the mechanism proposed here carries us beyond  the mere cataloging of characteristics The endless diversity of myths  and rituals derives from the fact that they all seek to recollect and  reproduce something they never succeed in comprehending There is  only one generative event only one way to grasp its truth by means  of my hypothesis On the other hand there are innumerable ways of  missing it hence the multiplicity of religious systems My thesis results  from an eminently positive line of inquiry 1 have a certain confidence  in languagecontrary to some modern thinkers who at the very mo ment when truth becomes accessible in language declare that language  is incapable of expressing truth This absolute distrust of language in a  period of mythic dilapidation like our own may well serve the same  purpose as the excessive confidence that prevailed before the dilapida tion when no decisive truth was in sight   Our theory should be approached then as one approaches any  scientific hypothesis The reader must ask himself whether it actually  takes into account all the items it claims to cover whether it enables  him to assign to primitive institutions an origin function and structure  that cohere to one another as well as to their overall context whether  it allows him to organize and assess the vast accumulation of ethnologi cal data and to do so in a truly economical manner without recourse  to exceptions and aberrations Above all he must ask himself  whether this theory applies not in single isolated instances but in every  conceivable situation Can he see the surrogate victim as that stone  initially rejected by the builders only to become the cornerstone of a  whole mythic and ritualistic edifice Or as the key that opens any  religious text revealing its innermost workings and rendering it for ever accessible to the human intellect    THAT INCOHERENCE TRADITIONALLY attrib uted to religious ideas seems to be particularly associated with the  theme of the scapegoat Frazer treats this subject at length his writing  is remarkable for its abundance of description and paucity of explana tion Frazer refuses to concern himself with the formidable forces at  work behind religious significations and his openly professed con tempt for religious themes protects him from all unwelcome discov eries   The notion that we can transfer our guilt and sufferings to some other  being who will bear them for us is familiar to the savage mind It arises  from a very obvious confusion between the physical and the mental be    Conclusion 311   tween the material and the immaterial Because it is possible to shift a  load of wood stones or what not from our own back to the back of  another the savage fancies that it is equally possible to shift the burden  of his pains and sorrows to another who will suffer them in his stead  Upon this idea he acts and the result is an endless number of very un amiable devices for palming off upon some one else the trouble which a  man shrinks from bearing himself In short the principle of vicarious  suffering is commonly understood and practised by races who stand on  a low level of social and intellectual culture4   However the disrepute in which he is held today is far from justifi able for few scholars have labored so diligently in the field or set forth  their findings with such admirable clarity And many later writers have  in effect done little more than repeat in somewhat different form  Frazers own profession of ignorance   Anyone who tries to subvert the sacrificial principle by turning it to  derision invariably becomes its unwitting accomplice Frazer is no  exception His work contributes to the concealment of the violent  impulse that lurks within the rite of sacrifice Such phrases as physical  loads and bodily and mental ailments recall nothing so much as the  platitudes of secondrate theologians and Frazer treats the act of sacri ficial substitution as if it were pure fantasy a nonphenomenon Yet  authors closer to our time have done the same and with considerably  less excuse for the Freudian notion of transference inadequate as it is  in some respects should at least have alerted us that something vital is  missing from the picture   The modern mind still cannot bring itself to acknowledge the basic  principle behind that mechanism which in a single decisive movement  curtails reciprocal violence and imposes structure on the community  Because of this willful blindness modern thinkers continue to see reli gion as an isolated wholly fictitious phenomenon cherished only by a  fewr backward peoples or milieus And these same thinkers can now  project upon religion alone the responsibility for a violent projection  of violence that truly pertains to all societies including our own This  attitude is seen at its most flagrant in the wrriting of that gentleman ethnologist Sir James Frazer Frazer along with his rationalist col leagues and disciples was perpetually engaged in a ritualistic expulsion  and consummation of religion itself which he used as a sort of scape goat for all human thought Frazer like many another modern thinker  washed his hands of all the sordid acts perpetrated by religion and  pronounced himself free of all taint of superstition He wras evidently  unaware that this act of handwashing has long been recognized as a  purely intellectual nonpolluting equivalent of some of the most an  4 J G Frazer The Golden Bough 1 vol abridged New York 1963 p 624     318 Violence and the Sacred   cient customs of mankind His writing amounts to a fanatical and  superstitious dismissal of all the fanaticism and superstition he had  spent the better part of a lifetime studying   The sacrificial character of this misunderstanding should remind us  that today more than ever before we will encounter resistance when  we try to rid ourselves of ignoranceeven though the time has come  for this ignorance to yield to knowledge This resistance is similar to  what Freud calls resistance but far more formidable We are not deal ing with the sort of repressed desires that everyone is really eager to  put on public display but with the most tenacious myths of modern ism with everything in short that claims to be free of all mythical  influence   What I have said of Freud holds true for all modes of modern  thought most particularly for ethnology to which Freud was irre sistibly drawn That ethnology is alive today when the traditional  modes of interpretation are sick unto death is evidence of a new  sacrificial crisis This crisis is similar but not identical to previous ones  We have managed to extricate ourselves from the sacred somewhat  more successfully than other societies have done to the point of losing  all memory of the generative violence but we are now about to redis cover it The essential violence returns to us in a spectacular manner  not only in the form of a violent history but also in the form of  subversive knowledge This crisis invites us for the very first time to  violate the taboo that neither Heraclitus nor Euripides could ever quite  manage to violate and to expose to the light of reason the role played  by violence in human society     Bibliography   Arrowsmith William The Criticism of Greek Tragedy Tulane Drama  Review 3 no 3 1959

nowadays  extrapolating from a single event to a crisis is only wrong when your opponents do it Just a  few months ago many commentators on the Right extrapolated a supposed crisis of illegal  immigrant crime from the murder of a single American by an illegal immigrant At the time  progressives recognized this for the irrational fearmongering that it was Yet it is the same  awed logic that extrapolates an alleged crisis of campus racism from a single racist incident  Besides there remains the question nearly unaskable in polite company of whether von  Abeles drunken diatribe was actually racist to begin with Sure it was narcissistic selfpitying  and belligerent But was it an expression of bigotry  At a glance its hard to reconcile the belief that von Abeles comments were bigoted with the  fact that black activists routinely get praised for making similar statements Von Abeles  remark I love myself and I love white people sounds eerily similar to I love my blackness  and yours the Twitter mantra of Black Lives Matter leader Deray McKesson Were white  men we did everything nearly echoes a statement made in a commencement speech by  Alicia Garza a cofounder of Black Lives Matter Without black womenthere would be no  me no you no us no civilized society of which we speak WeI you and mewe owe  everything to black women Von Abeles monologue universally condemned took lines  straight from the scripts of Americas most celebrated racial justice advocates  On the prejudicepluspower conception of racism von Abeles position in the racial privilege  hierarchy as a white person renders his comments racist whereas McKesson and Garzas  positions as members of a historically marginalized group renders theirs permissible if not  enlightened  A great way to instantly be seen as a naf a racist or both is to ask why this double standard  exists The answer of course is historical context Black people were brought to America in  chains forced to work as chattel subjugated formally and informally for a century aer  abolition all the while ghting to see themselves as beautiful in a culture hellbent on  convincing them they were ugly stupid and inferior Black race pride therefore is a rejection  of and an adaptation to the racist elements in Americas reprehensible past One cannot  make the same claim about white race pride which historically has been more associated  with brutal oppression than with noble rebellion  This history lesson is without doubt important But does the fact of antiblack racism  whether past or present overt or systemic prove that its okay for a white person to be  banned from a campus for saying things that black people get ovations for Decent ethical  people are supposed to vigorously nod yesor better yet not ask the question

students surrounding him he added the caveat I dont  hate other people I just love white men  Students and administrators reacted to the incident with unanimous condemnation Barnard  College Columbias

systemic problem calling for a  systemic solution Columbias Black Student Organization led the charge with a list of  demands including extra time for aected students to complete their nal exams

of scientic racism into the Frontiers of Science syllabus Surely they meant  the incorporation of information about scientic racism  SHARE     Privacy  Cookies This site uses cookies By continuing to

who experienced far more antiblack racism than the leaders of  Black Lives Matter do today Bayard Rustin Martin Luther King Jrs strategist and the chief  organizer of the March On Washington was arrested no less than 23 times during an era of  profound racism He nevertheless considered it obvious that blacks could be racist just like  whites and he vocally opposed such racism wherever he encountered it  The same is true of  Eldridge Cleaver an early leader of the Black Panther party  But more to the point if we decide to give black activists a free pass to express racial pride  because they face racial slights why not allow von Abele the same pass Aer all Columbias  campus is no stranger to antiwhite rhetoric Take for instance the criticism commonly  heard in Columbia dorm rooms that the Western canon is decient because its lled with  dead white men Does having to hear the likes of Homer Plato and Rousseau dismissed not  as bad writers but as writers of your race qualify you to express race pride in response  And the dead white men trope is only the tip of the iceberg In my two and a half years on  Columbias campus I can count my experiences of antiblack racism on one handindeed  one nger By comparison I could ll a small diary with the antiwhite comments some  intended in jest and others in earnest that Ive heard  I sometimes wonder how I would feel if I had to hear Frederick Douglass Bayard Rustin and  James Baldwin dismissed in casual conversation not as bad writers but as dead black men I  wonder whether I would have the presence of mind to dismiss such statements as harmless  nonsense or whether the experience of hearing my heroes derided in explicitly racial terms  terms that linked their inadequacy to my own racial identitywouldnt awaken a sense of  grievance within me I wonder moreover how I would feel if I couldnt complain  1  2  SHARE     Privacy  Cookies This site uses cookies By continuing to use this website you agree to

Quillette  httpsquillettecom20190116tiersofprideandshame 553  Von Abeles error was not that he expressed white racial pride His erroralong with  McKessons and Garzaswas to play the racial pride game at all The notion that your value  lies in your membership to the race you were born into by chance makes no sense taking  credit for the achievements of other people with whom you share a skin color makes no  sense Rustin put it well when he observed that the breastbeating white makes the same  error as the Negro who swears that black is beautiful Both are seeking refuge in  psychological solutions to social questions  Whats more pride and shame are two sides of the same coin so if collective pride makes  sense then collective shame makes sense too The same awed logic that allows von Abele to  feel proud of the accomplishments of dead white men should lead him to feel ashamed of  their sins Conversely the progressive logic that encourages modernday whites to feel shame  for slavery and colonialism should also lead them to feel pride for their ancestors  achievements Both white chauvinists and white progressives dogmatically reject one half of  the prideshame binary Both factions should go one step further and reject the concepts of  collective pride and collective shame altogether  The massive gulf between how we treat expressions of white pride and black pride is  unsustainable I dont expect the gulf to collapse into a colorblind singularity overnight that  would be unrealistic But anyone who values consistency and believes that a persons skin  color is irrelevant to their moral character should want at a minimum to begin narrowing  the gulf     Coleman Hughes is a Quillette columnist and an undergraduate philosophy major at  Columbia University His

said something stupid  his reaction was one where he was under  social duress and he was over adrenalised as a result One against many is hard to handle for anyone  This nonviolent reaction to insanity should occur more and more oen The thing is we are not actually  talking about insanity  but pure and utter self interest and group behavior dressed up as progressiveness It  needs to be strongly rejected  Since 1990 according to immigration gures more black folk have arrived voluntarily than the total who  disembarked in chains before the United States outlawed international slave tracking in 1807 More have  been coming here annually  about 50000 legal immigrants  than in any of the peak years of the middle  passage across the Atlantic and more have migrated here from Africa since 1990 than in nearly the entire  preceding two centuries  jimhaz I wouldnt exactly call having to leave ones war torn country voluntarily And they did not choose  the US on their own volition it was dictated by international policies I suspect many refugees would rather  safely be in their country of birth  mj its not like all of Africa was simultaneously at war If those refugees did prefer to live in their home  countries they would have moved back when things stabilised  jimhaz what is your estimate for the number of slaves who entered the US between 1787 and 1807 My  estimate is less than 200000 But I might be wrong Do you have access to other estimates for this number  What is your estimate for the total number of black immigrants into the US between 1807 and now Mine is  over two million But I know of no good estimates of this number  If you or Coleman Hughes or others could provide your own estimates for these numbers this would be  helpful I am honestly afraid to even publicly describe a model to estimate these numbers  mj could you elaborate on your point Why do you think African immigrants to the US were forced to  move between 1807 and the present  jimhaz

that Africans needed to leave their own countries Let us take the  great Congo war that might have killed over 7 million Africans or what some call WWIII It is the  responsibility of Africans to save their own countries from genocide How can they do this if they ee  I am not sure our species is mature enough to discuss African issues or slavery For example see the very  violent response of many readers to this light touch of the subject  httpswwwbrownpunditscom20190118howtoavoidoendingpeople  Perhaps there are simply large parts of human history or the current human condition that are not  currently discussable by our species  I dont know about stupid drunk yes People are exonerated for all types of crimes for being drunk I think  this is one of those crimes He saw the same injustice that was pointed out in the article and becuase the  lters where nonexistent he spoke Give him a break hes twenty something If that is the worst thing he  ever does then hes better than most  Great article White pride and white guilt are equally misplaced If my distant ancestors behaved badly to  your distant ancestors or vice versa then I urge all of them to return from the dead and throw down

least contract yet the pursuit of Grievance Studies in  our Universities and the resulting Grievance culture is doing quite the opposite This will not end well  Western Civilization is a white

fullyevolved  individuals those areas governed by less advanced races fall quickly into barbarism as we see in so many  places today  In normal times racism is so universally experienced that historians hardly bother to call attention to it It is  only in diseased and perverted eras like our own that elites rail against this ineradicable and precious  human attribute  Hate too is a

and the free exchange of ideas help human societies ourish and progress Quillette aims to  provide a platform for this exchange  Daniel its so laughably ridiculous it has to be satire Pretty bad satire though Are there people who  actually believe this crap In this century  While I nd the thoughts and ideas presented by Tito so repugnant and deplorable I would invite hem to  leave my house I will defend to the death his right to say totally stupid things  Darn  it hurt to write that but I mean it  George there are very few comments that I would nd repugnant and deplorable rather just stupid and  uninformed Titos comment made so little impact on my thinking that I was surprised it got so many  reactions its not even worth arguing with  WRT the article Colemans point about von Abele reacting to the constant belittling of whites on campus  needs further exploration  Coleman is arguing against discrimination on the basis of race He says that everybody ought to be treated  the same Tito Perdue simply disagrees He is hoping that being inammatory will make racial  reconciliation more dicult to achieve But holders of his views are now a tiny minority in this country and  their political power and actual impact on society do not justify the attention they are getting They ought to  simply be ignored as sad remnants of a failed philosophy struggling to fend o the inevitable

could be empirically perceived by  those with little imagination In my view Quillete should leave this comment alone and not join into the  frenzy of speech silencing zealotry I am very impressed with Coleman Hughes article I think it should be  widely distributed and understood by anyone who cares about the world I would add that I am very  impressed with his writing and ideas This is indeed one of the best articles I have read in a long time  I agree with Constantin Bizarrely I think Tito Perdues comment adds to the discussion here If one is to  pass the ideological Turing test you need the positions of those you disagree with to clearly outline their  belief in the light of day reprehensible as they may be  I agree also that tito perdues comment should be le up It appears to be a sincere attempt to express a  stupid perspective I think comment deletion should be reserved for actual trolls people making comments  that are clearly insincere and meant only to incite conict or those being verbally abusive or threatening  violence We can handle seeing terrible ideas like titos expressed in a civil manner and they can potentially  add something valuable to the discussion as an example of the type of philosophy Coleman Hughes article  is arguing against  Asenath Waite  Point by point tho what about Titos views do you nd stupid or reprehensible I suspect his views are far  more extreme than mine but to give the Devil his due we should articulate what we might disagree with  not merely denounce him For example I myself do not think that racism is a wonderful institution but I do  think that Tito is correct that it represents the default position of 99 of humanity over 99 of historical  time Fact is that we are all racists Indeed studies have shown that folks who declare themselves to be non  racist are subliminally more racist than otherwise I myself am a racist  like everyone else  but I prefer to  deal with it upfront rather than pretending that Im not Being honest gives you a handle on your own  mind For example whereas I recognize the fact that in SS Africa the average IQ is about 70 I also see that  Mr Hughes  being an individual and not only an instance of his averagedout racial group  is probably  smarter than me Im a white supremacist who would have voted for Obama were I American  Ray Andrews  GL January 17 2019  Asenath Waite January 17

he doesnt get the right to  state his position clearly as it is stated  And this article 1000  Ray Andrews  A white supremacist is not someone who acknowledges average racial IQ dierences A white supremacist is  someone who believes that essentially all white people are superior to essentially all people of other races  and that white people should be given legal privileges above those granted to members of other races See  apartheid South Africa and the historical USA for examples of white supremacist societies If you support  the establishment of such societies in the current day then I would have to say that I nd you to be a morally  decient human being  I have a hard time believing Tito is real He seems too perfect Theres a word for this that I cant quite  recall but IMO his thoughts are too organized Seems fake Could be wrong And this is coming from a guy  called Peanut Gallery YMMV  Asenath Waite  A white supremacist is not someone who acknowledges average racial IQ dierences  It depends on how woke the person with whom you are speaking is I qualify as a WS in the eyes of the  victimographers who insist that unless I abhor my white guilt and apologize for things my own ancestors  didnt even actually do I must be a WS Acknowledging racial dierences is not permitted among the  Correct it is sure proof that one is a Nazi What I really am is a supporter of

httpsquillettecom20190116tiersofprideandshame 1553  I completely agree that it is as wrong for whites to have white pride as it is for blacks to have black pride  because the color of ones skin is not a reason for pride or shame There is nothing intrinsic about a  particular color of skin that merits either sentiment The mere possession of one or another color of skin  should not be a reason for shame or pride but the content of our character and our behavior  However and there is always a however the color of ones skin does lead to dierent experiences of the  world oen from our earliest days primarily because of the existence of racism and the mistaken belief that  the color of our skin reveals something intrinsic about us and our character According to the best science it  does not It reveals nothing about us as individuals except perhaps the length of time since our lineage le  Africa  Unfortunately humans have tended to categorize each other ranking each other in various ways and skin  color and other supercial physical traits have historically been a way of doing so This has led to individuals  and groups having dierent rights experiences of justice and unequal access to the benets of our society  Therefore we should acknowledge that individuals and groups have dierent experiences because of  possessing dierent skin colors and the social economic and political consequences of having the wrong  or right color of skin depending on the context It would be a mistake to pretend that skin color hasnt and  doesnt still have an impact on our daily lives It does The objective should be to work towards a world  where skin color no longer results in dierential experience of rights freedoms and benets of our world  All of us could feel pride at working for and achieving that  the mistaken belief that the color of our skin reveals something intrinsic about us and our character  But of course this is NOT a mistaken belief To be a member of a more evolved race does reveal a great deal  about a persons quality The lunatic notion of racial equality has by now made such progress that I dont see  how our civilization can survive for much longer  Nothing is equal the races least of all If the races were equal countries would be equal whereas in fact there  has never existed a blackmajority state that wasnt a hell on earth For white people to impute equality to  black people is akin to ranking rap and rock with Beethoven and Wagner  tito perdue  Did you write Fur Elise Neither did I The overall accomplishments of a race of people do not confer value  on individuals belonging to those races If you judge an individual based on the average attributes of the  race they happen to belong to that is wrong from both a rational and in my opinion moral perspective Its  an inarguable fact that there are massive numbers of black people who are far more intelligent and  accomplished than massive numbers of white people  January 17 2019  tito

httpsquillettecom20190116tiersofprideandshame 1653  Asenath Waite  Except that we all have built in to us a very honest risk appraisal mechanism In every situation it very  quickly sends a report to our executive function as to what around us is potentially dangerous  and it is  brutally honest since if functions below the level of PC Why are black cops just as likely as white cops to  shoot young black men disproportionately Because all cops know what they know which is that young  black males are something like 20 X more likely than people at large to be carrying a gun and prepared to  use it on them True In the best of all possible worlds they would have time to make a less stereotyped  decision but in the real word we all make this kind of generalization and sometimes act on it very quickly  It is indeed the fact that many blacks are highly intelligent but the fact also is that only 15 of blacks in  America have above average intelligence I know that and so do you even if you pretend that you dont I  suggest that what we should try to do is not try to stop our appraisal mechanism from doing its job rather  on the executive level we should try to put that report aside and force ourselves when possible to  remember that everyone is an individual  Getting tired might not read all comments but so far Ray Andrews is exactly right about everything  Best line I know there are racial group mean dierences in IQ and so do you even though you pretend  you dont  Ray Andrews  I thought the stats showed that cops didnt actually shoot black people disproportionately to white people I  believe I read that in cases of a suspect resisting arrest cops were found to be more likely to use deadly force  on white suspects over black suspects likely hesitating more in the latter case for fear of the greater  repercussions associated with killing a black suspect  Also Im well aware of the IQ thing but that doesnt contradict anything I said in my comment Seems like  youre just reiterating what tito said here I fully agree with your last sentence which also doesnt contradict  anything I said Its reasonable to have some degree of prejudice regarding any person or situation based on  prior knowledge of similar persons or situations but one should be willing to readily set aside this prejudice  when new information regarding the particular circumstance or individual in question is presented to us  Ray Andrews the dolphin January 17 2019  Tony January 17 2019  Asenath Waite January 18 2019  Asenath Waite January 18 2019  S H A R E     Privacy  Cookies

shot more oen but overall they are shot more oen due to being so much more  likely to be involved with the cops But my essential point is that when we correct for the situation black  cops do not shoot black suspects less oen than do white cops The entire racism thing is just plain wrong  tito perdue January 18 2019  mj January 22 2019  Amanda January 17 2019  Ray Andrews the dolphin January

is certainly a worthy goal for no one to have dierent experiences because of their race but  the tough part comes in convincing people to embrace the solution  If I had grown up in San Francisco I would be racist against black people I was there a week for a  conference and every black person I saw was hugely overweight obnoxious disrespectful and stupid The  one exception was a beautiful kind thoughtful black woman working security at the conference who  stopped me to compliment me on being the only one smiling She was from Alabama and said she found  San Francisco much more racist  This was in sharp contrast to the black people I had grown up with in Montreal a friend in elementary  school and her family Her dad was a lawyer and her mom a stayathome parent who took us out to the  pool on summer days while my mom was working They lived in a gorgeous mansion and my friends little  sister was as adorable and wellbehaved as a princess I couldnt help but contrast my poor white self my  single mom and dysfunctional family with these amazing successful people Those early experiences  formed my subconscious impression of black people in a way I didnt understand until I saw their opposite  in San Francisco  If we want people to not treat others badly because of their race those people need to grow up with a  positive view of people of other races That can only happen if everyone attempts to represent their race  well It will take time and probably be rejected by the le because it asks people to take responsibility for  how they are perceived but we are not going to program out our natural urge to categorise We should  instead work with it such that no child grows up with the impression people of a certain race are bad  The problem is not what he said it is their intolerance of someone from a race they have pathologised  expressing pride in his race as they express pride in theirs It is their disordered view and bigotry toward  whites which see it as an aront They project their own bigotry onto him They see White Supremacy  because they wish for Black Supremacy  its in their doctrines If you look at Critical Theory Race Studies  it is the disgust at Whites that mirrors Nazi race theory  the exact same thing  anything they have they  stole anything they do causes harm eorts at peace are a lie eorts at defence like the lad above are signs  of inherent aggression It wouldnt matter what he said or did  they would see it as an oence to them  because they are bigoted because they have been taught bigotry  antiwhite bigotry Its not what hes  saying its their reaction Everyone is allowed to express pride in their people  so are Whites If someone  takes oence to that thats their problem We are not prisoners of history  ps if I hear a black guy saying he loves being black it doesnt aect me at all  good on him or an English  guy loves being English great for him too If hes a White Supremacist Nazi its not his love for his own  people but his hate for others I object to There is too much policing of the discourse stoked by insane  theories coming from Grievance Studies that make everything into an oence because it is a rigid  January 23 2019

between the races and genders  and it is getting its way It has to go  I agree I still cant believe how angry people acted when someone le a sign that said its ok to be white In  the Western countries its the same nonsense The sign is being called racist as though it actually said  anything racist at all It sounded to me like a response to the rhetoric being spewed in the schools that want  to shame white kids for things they never did They want them to feel bad for having parents that made  better choices than others have They have lectures from giant black women with no credentials weaing  inappropriate and unprofessional attire like skin tight bodysuits and talking out their asses about all white  people are racist and thats that How they can think their problems stem from racism and not their  behavior or their lack of decorum or their refusal to talk like an intelligent adult White people had damn  well better show embarrassment for their skin color If black students want to dictate who can be on campus  and who cant it better happen or there will be an immature response like screaming in the yard at a  professor over Halloween costumes The demand that this kid be punished is insane so what if a drunk kid  said he likes white people and pointed out uncomfortable truths he didnt say anything rude or mean about  anyone elses heritage Its ubsurd that BLM riots are called protests The students and falculty at evergreen  demonstrated the worst behavior and disrespect for their professors and colleges over alleged constant  racism claims that were never elaborated on just claims of racism They had that nasty woman professor  leading them shouting to the most racist things that school ever heard Professors of color besides her who  werent black got in on the hysteria too by accusing a white professor who dared to argue back and although  he was a good 20  away when he pointed towards her she acted like he violently attacked her Then there  are all the hate hoaxes on campus Students at Drake actually painted a street black because of alleged notes  turns out the black student sent themselves the notes I can go on but you cant cry about oppression while  being oppressive thats hypocritical The le is outrageous with their hypocritical antics Is it suprizing to  see people call bullshit on the racists who cry racism These progressive dumbasses expect the world cater to  their personal micro aggressions well everyone except white kids Because if you correct the pronunciation  of words to a non white kid its racist It used to be called teaching but now its bad How about everyone  admit things have gone so far that its laughable I think thats what this kid was expressing more than white  pride Not everything is racist Quit trying to ban everything Everyone should be expected to show  authorities and superiors respect Everyone should be held to the same rules Everyone should have to do  the same work at the same time as everyone else We got minority groups who cry racism for being treated  as equally as everyone else They cant be allowed to keep getting away with this shit Its counterproductive  Giving students of color more perks and longer times to do the same work or exemptions from tests just  because they get loud and make threats will make people think they didnt earn their degrees or positions  and noone respects that Some of these alleged professors dont seem to have any sort of intelligence nor do  they sound educated Look at our Congress we got racist Muslims woman beating AG in Minnesota  immigration

historic gures in the past with  the same skin tone makes no sense but as a positive expression is not as bad as expressing hatred or anger  towards a group based on skin tone religion ethnicity etc based on crimes committed in the past  What is a huge problem is that racism and sexism have become accepted and instituitionalised against  supposedly powerful groups basically white men There is a widespread narrative that white men should be  criticised and actively discriminated against because they are white and male based on the supposed crimds  of white males in the past In this context arguing that white men in thd past have achieved many positive  things is antiracist rather than racist It would be unnecessary and perhaps inappropriate if not for the  endemic systematic and instutuionalised racism and sexim in american academic instituitions  Teh reaction to this statement versus countless others which laud black achievements shows the reality of  discrimination in these environments  Given the actual context it is arguably a brave if arguably foolish act of resistance  The racist aspect of this seems to be a mostly US phenomenen there are examples in the UK but far rarer as  an import from the US which sits uneasily in British culture The sexism part is endemic in western culture  and seems to continue to get worse  Would the Bronze Age Ancients considered the founders of Western Civilization be considered White if  they were transported in time to now Not likely  Dividing people into such massive oversimplications as Asians Blacks and Whites and then ascribing  common traits to all of them especially ancestral sin helps no one to understand our world and our place in  it None of these groups are monolithic cultures  Personally speaking as a pale person I nd being lumped in as a White to be spectacularly tedious There  are nations of pale people who if they were dark would be held up as yet more examples of victims of  White colonial aggression These folks are lost to time and ideology blamed for the actions of their  conquerors if they exist at all I am a lucky mutt of at least two of these nations  18th century European colonialism was the foreign policy of a small number of coastal European countries  decided and enacted by a tiny coterie of elites And yet because of surface similarities with those  nationalities it is a truism that all pale people the world over without exception and no dark people  whatsoever were enriched because of it irrespective of history and logic  Please consider this it is a glaringly obvious fact that dierent breeds of dog have quite dierent attributes  Border collies make excellent sheepdogs corgis are generally quite stupid American pit bulls like to eat  children I generalize

Moving right along to the various breeds of human beings I am not going to instruct you on the obvious  inherent dierences  that would only give rise to cries of Racism and Bigotry It should be sucient to  acknowledge that there are striking dierences I do not regard the current Black Get Square movement as  an advance or a civilizing inuence  I dont think it is intended to be It is just political BS When I was very  young what is now called White Privilege was called The White Mans Burden How times change  Based on what evidence do you think the genetic elasticity of dog or cattle breeds accurately compares to  genetic variations across human population groups And how does the intentional selective breeding of  domesticated animals for specic traits compare to the tness selection process for dierent human groups  if at all Or is this just anintuition of yours  That evidence is all around if you wish to see it Consider one example you will never nd a West African  runner winning an elite worldclass marathon you will never nd an East African runner winning the  hundredyard sprint I base that assertion on history bodybuild and current and recent world records West  African types hold all the sprint distance world records East Africans the world marathon records Africans  many living in the West dominate worldclass running events  There is good an bad in all races indeed in each one of us  To take the views and actions of immature students who show a racial preference for the same race     eight black women     and a drunk as a matter for serious discussion and not what it is base and shallow  is a mistake something one would think the university administration would recognize Sadly given the  presentday reality yes there is evidence all around for this too if you care to look for it of those who run  those intellectual cess pits it is not surprising  The problem is that there is insucient data because it is politically incorrect to study such dierences The  obvious model to use would be admixture studies based on the fact that there has bee some genetic mixing  of black and white genes for centuries One piece of evidence for this is the occaisional appearance of sickle  cell anaemia in whites If traits are genetic then they will vary statistically according to the proportion of  blackwhite genes  Anyone stupid enough to apply for a grant to study this would be horsewhipped by the committee and the  public when it was leaked  Emblem14 January 17 2019  Sobre January 17 2019  Fran January 22 2019  SHARE     Privacy

wouldnt put that one on your cups and mugs  Its still amazing to me how the several racists who comment here have decided that Race leaving aside how  one can precisely delineate races or seperate the social construct element from the biological element is the  proper framework through which to understand human dierence Of all the Theories of Dierence its  genetic determinism and some weird quasi familial anity for people with the same shade of skin and facial  features that for them best explains why the world is the way it is Forget other variables of basic historical  contingency or environmental constraints or advantages  no the proper way to construct societies create  social bonds and trust and to formulate a ranking of social values is through extended tribal networks based  on physical appearance And this is supposed to be the hidden truth of the world That barbarism should  be the normative model of human society  Even if you took the most aggressive bell curve arguments at face value theres more overlap between  groups near the middle of the distribution than there is nonoverlapping disparity at the tails Meaning that  even if we used our as yet very limited understanding of genetic determinism as a serious social sorting  mechanism wed still have a very large multiracial mix of people in the average range including slightly  below and above Maybe some groups would be greatly overrepresented in the top ranges and some others  in the bottom but the mediocre middle would still be the multicultural hell these white chauvinists detest so  much The only way to resolve this is by instituting racial collectivism for how individuals are treated which  negates the very concepts of individual agency and merit We already saw how this works in practice for  most of American history  The Commies wanted a totalitarianism dened by class membership the Nazis wanted one dened by  national and ethnic membership and these white supremacists being the least sophisticated will settle for  mere appearance and culture aka the particular parochial traditions and customs of some white people in  some places As if some MAGA hat wearing redneck is the cultural custodian of Aristotle Beethoven and  Descartes rather than gun fetishism and dumbeddown evangelical christianity  Deciding what crew to run with based on physical attributes or blood ancestry is what barbarians do in pre  modern tribal societies or inside modern prisons Great fucking models  Regardless of genetic determinism one splitsecond look at a person contains way more information than  youd like to admit Of course there is much more information to be gained by getting to know an  individual but that takes a major investment in time that isnt practical for many purposes One doesnt  need a racist view of the inherent superiority of the X race to simply apply Bayes theorem use whatever  information you have to update your assumptions  dirk January 17 2019  Emblem14 January 17 2019  Stef

dierence in outcome must be  due to Oppression  they dene their existence entirely as an instance of their Identity groups We racists  point out that there are other reasons for unequal outcomes that are much more believable However we  despair of the entire subject of Identity politics and we wish that each individual would be judged as she is  not according to her Identity Our individual realities are so complex that they simply cannot be reduced to  our membership in our Intersectional Identities  Maybe some groups would be greatly overrepresented in the top ranges  Exactly It is not surprising that Jews have won something like 25 of all Nobel Prizes The thing is that no  one cares about the folks in the middle of the bellcurves who mostly lead normal lives as normal people  The ghting is all about representation at the top end Alas as we go higher up the curve we see a dramatic  fallo of certain groups It really is quite proper that on merit we see more Asians than Whites in elite  universities Nothing broken nothing to x there  Deciding what crew to run with based on physical attributes or blood ancestry is what barbarians do in pre  modern tribal societies or inside modern prisons  Yes What Westerners gured out is how to have a meritocracy We dont do it perfectly but we do it better  than anyone else so far If you are good you will rise and we dont really care about your race or your  religion or your favorite color Those who make it make it We arent keeping score It is the Warriors who  demand equal outcomes when the incomes are not equal Sorry but they arent  Im sure youre aware of the studies that Peterson likes to cite about gender dierences in occupational  choice in egalitarian Scandinavian countries They suggest that when you remove environmental obstacles  to equality biological dierences maximise  In the same vein for those who believe biological factors of intelligence or good personality traits are far  more inuential and heritable than is considered polite to say in the current climate the best strategy to  prove this theory is to actually capitulate to most of the equity policies favored by the social constructionists  to level the playing eld  If the bio determinists are right no amount of external leveling will change the underlying intractable  forces that drive inequality and as a bonus social constructionism can be strongly debunked because they  were able to run their experiment and will run out of excuses  Wouldnt they move the goalposts They might try but right now there are still too many environmental  factors that can plausibly explain ongoing inequalities and that supposition will stay intact until you can  separate the signal from the noise  Emblem14  Emblem14 January 17 2019

3353  Interesting idea Let them spend their capital till they go bankrupt But how much disruption and bother in  the meantime  If my memory serves Mr Hughes is a philosophy studentI have to say that the logic and clarity of his  writing is refreshing I have read all his articles on Quillette and I found this his most concise and best  craed Kudos to him  People are going to nd comradeship with others who look like them think like them act like them In  short people who share their DNA And pride emerges when your team does well Especially when exposed  to others who look think and act very dierently and in opposition  This is simply not going to change If you build an ideology around the idea that it can and must change by  constant pressure and force that ideology is set up to collapse the moment an alternative becomes available  In the West that moment is close at hand  Genetic ancestry is just one dimension of similarity you might share with someone else Its a pretty shallow  one It has never been adequate in isolation at fomenting kinship between nonfamily members There are  so many other more meaningful and more socially successful sociallybinding concepts that thinking  DNA or skin color is the most important one reveals a kind of brutal simple mindedness that is frankly  baing  If Quillette have any integrity theyll delete such admittedly racist content Declan  Censoring comments just for their content is a ridiculous idea Bad ideas dont go away just because you  dont let yourself see them  Of course they wont go away Thats not the point of moderating

Columbia has a Black Student Organization If thats true could they also have a White  Students Organization Ill bet not by the same double standard  Good thoughtful article as usual Regarding the last point  that pride in or shame for ones ethnic identity  makes no sense that seems like a reasonable take at rst but I have come to the conclusion that its not quite  as simple Pride and shame in ones own deeds and achievements are the emotions that come with the  realization I did something well I should do more of that and I messed that up I should stop that or go  about it dierently respectively Perfectly reasonable  Pride and shame in ones group  it could be the family the university the town or the race ethnicity  culture  stand for the realization the group is doing good and I should joyfully participate in whatever  theyre doing or what this group is doing is fucked up I should not participate and either dissociate from  them or get them to change their ways Which would be an entirely justied reaction if youd been born  into to pick an obvious example Hitlerera Germany Even though ones inuence on the group is  sometimes just a drop in the ocean these are still important and worthwhile sentiments both for the  individual and for keeping the community on track  Pride and shame in ones groups past achievements and deeds is a little tricker Obviously I cant change  anything about the past and I didnt have a hand in it one way or another but its still helpful to ask if what  happened was on the whole good or shameful and which aspects of culture that led to one outcome or the  other are still active If they are good aspects then take pride and cultivate the traditions if they are bad feel  shame if you are involved with them and work to discontinue them Makes good sense to me  Of course things are always brighter or darker shades of gray rather than unalloyed good or evil and shame  for some aspects of your culture shouldnt demolish your selfworth if you are a good person and neither  should pride in your group elevate you above members of other groups That said compared to the  competition those white men havent done that bad globally speaking

Social Justice apparently  FluyB  Youve hit on areas of this article that got me thinking along similar lines Pride in membership of any kind  and pride of ones own accomplishments are very dierent Both are likely to be detrimental in any but the  smallest doses Yet how do we separate harmful pride from feeling good about individual or group  successes  Pride has been regarded rightfully I think as the mother of all sin It is an opportunistic entry point for the  worst of our natural tendencies If you have time to indulge prideful thinking then you are probably  neglecting practical matters that deserve more of your attention  When Mr Hughes got to mentioning pride I had hoped he might help us dierentiate racial pride from  racial identity If ones racial or ethnic identity was merely conscious or incidental rather than instrumental  then we could dispense with a lot of unnecessary tension and discuss more important things  This article lled me with so much hope for us all and it felt like a light switched on in my head When you  hear something that articulates a truth you always knew but couldnt express Thank you Coleman Hughes  for your work  Unfortunately I also read some of the comments and this Tito person makes my stomach turn over and  reminds me that we all balance on a razors edge between the best and worst humanity is capable of Heres  hoping for the best     pride and shame are two sides of the same coin   Both factions should go one step further and reject the  concepts of collective pride and collective shame altogether  This is a VERY important point that is is need of clarication  Pride and shame are indeed two sides of the same coin which is the coin of shared tribal or national  identity which is fundamental to being human evolved human nature

because we share the same race but not with non  white Americans anymore than they would identify with me I am I guess a white nationalist or  identitarian as were Americas founding fathers who were the original white nationalists  I feel pride in white achievements  shame for the terrible things we have done both to ourselves and to  others and I think this a good thing Coleman Hughes suggestion of doing away with collective ie tribal  identity pride  shame I think a very bad idea reminiscent of how communism sought to change human  nature to suit its own ends  We need to understand and learn how to work WITH human nature which as I say in inherently tribal  instead of demonising it which is what academics are in the habit of doing in the service of their state  employer which wants everyone regardless of race to identify with itself as their tribe or nation  I tweet on this these issues a lot and invite anyone who is interested to take a look  httpstwittercomrogerahicksstatus1008227827945213952  Why are you able to extend your feeling of kinship and belonging to a huge collective of millions of  strangers some of whom have very little in common with you other than ancestry or appearance and yet  you cannot muster this sense of belonging with people who may have many things in common with you  but have a dierent appearance or color or ancestry  Youve already abstracted your tribal anities to the broader concept of RACE which encompasses millions  and has heavily socially constructed parameters Why do you think you chose race and not religion or  nation or some other proposition of shared value Why race  And given that you did not choose your race or the lineage of your birth is your endorsement of collective  pride or shame based on some metaphysical sense of collective agencyresponsibility or is it more of a  social phenomenon to signal group loyalty for strictly instrumental reasons  In the real world how are we seeing extending our feeling of kinship to other racial groups playing out for  Europeans around the world Hows that working out for us Seems to be were being dispossessed and  piecemeal ethnically cleansed

Likewise everyone should be upset when they hear people being disparaged for being members of a  particular race eg dead white men Therefore I think the drunk kid was wrong to express personal pride  in the accomplishments of others of his race but right to speak out against racist attitudes  If the civilizational challenge is to overcome the tribalism on which our survival depended since the  beginning of time I can not see how strident identitarian politics provide a viable answer I strongly believe  that it is the most misguided way to reverse the progress of the last 100 years and of sowing discord and  mistrust among people exactly when they made the longest strides towards eliminating prejudice and  expanding their horizons  The experience of Europe  and increasingly elsewhere  shows that forced cultural dilution and population  replacement is causing a great deal of fear and insecurity It must be understood that such policies are a very  bold form of identitarian politics in reverse The idea that assaulting and destroying cultural geographic and  physical kinship is a fast portal into a rosy globalized utopia appears to be mostly misring and fuelling the  resurrection of cultural and racial identitarianism My point is that identitarianism begets identiarianism  and that it betrays fundamentally the project of such luminaries as Martin Luther King It is indeed  unfortunate that some continue to confuse revenge with justice and enjoy the existential worries of former  oppressors While psychologically easy to understand like all human basic impulses it is hard to see how  any rational individual would see such actions as building trust and laying a foundation for a peaceful and  harmonious coexistence  The position that there is no culture worth preserving or protecting unless backed up by a real threat of  suicide bombing and mass murder   and that ones cultural and physical including geographic co  existence and familiarity with others is an expression of deep held prejudice and bigotry is a profound  assault on that basic mechanism of survival that has been with us since the beginning of time Those who  mastermind and plot such assaults know this very well and intent to rapidly and no matter how painfully  replace an organically developed common identity with an expanded articial one They hope that the  transition would be a fast process of social engineering facilitated by a near complete monopoly on mass  media and education and an intentional weakening of national sovereignty  The problem with the progressive mindset has always been an unbridled messianism combined with the  willingness to impose hardship on those perceived as retrogrades in the process of rapidly building an  utopian future Historically they have mercilessly failed and followed a fully predictable pattern without  exception 1 they never had the patience to negotiate and wait for an organic evolution towards the desired  goal 2 they consider those who oppose their project subhuman and morally irredeemable and want them  eliminated from the public sphere 3 they adhere to a morality that denies the humanity of those opposing  their methods and power grab and revert to mob justice social lynching physical lynching and ultimately  the Gulag 4 have always been eliminated themselves by those more interested in the benets of  concentrated power than the utopian project itself and 4 once fully formed the resulting dictatorships  stied everything from economics to culture and decayed into untold misery and social strife  It is so easy and tempting to believe that a group of people or another is so weakened in their cohesion and  cultural heritage that delivering the coup de grace is justied  if nothing else  as an act of mercy Hungry  for power most people play a forceful positioning game in society and are all too willing to exploit alliances  of interest and grievance for dominance This has been so since the beginning of time and will likely be  there forever However it is also true that moral and intellectual leadership and inspiration could be also  gained from those who are not interested in dominance games and remain faithful to values that unite and  inspire This is why notable and worthy intellectual contributions such as the very interesting articles of Mr  Constantin January 17 2019  SHARE     Privacy

exquisite contribution to constitutional thought and human  progress and agree with those who want the constitutional foundation of the freest society in history  destroyed Worse of all you will

articulate their truth  even if gravely mistaken above the shrewd ones skillfully hiding their intent To illustrate this with an  example this is why I do not mind white or black supremacists openly voicing their opinion In doing so   they invite comment and feedback I also do not mind communist fringe groups writing or demonstrating  peacefully The real problem is with those who silence feedback and silence thought through the exercise of  physical and political power When a thug dons a mask and carries a baseball bat his or her intention is to  end conversation and dominate by power They are the ones who subvert the main achievements of the  Western Civilization and put at risk the future of the most just and free societies in history A white blue  polka dot or what have you supremacist

particularly this one  It is indeed unfortunate that some continue to confuse revenge with justice and enjoy the existential  worries of former oppressors While psychologically easy to understand like all human basic impulses it is  hard to see how any rational individual would see such actions as building trust and laying a foundation for  a peaceful and harmonious coexistence  Constantin  Are you by any chance running for public oce anywhere near me sir   constantin  Agree and TY  I couldnt literally have said it better  Constantin  Please split your writing into paragraphs If it werent for the praising comments I would have not read your  excellent post  I think another aspect to consider would be that of stereotyping and responsibility Like Germans aer  WW2 and to this day there is specter of collective guilt thrust upon whites for slavery even though no  white person alive owned slaves and no black person alive was a slave However when statistics on black  violence and crime are brought up the result is always the same stop stereotyping us So why are whites  made to suer for crimes committed but others are not  powerfulbeautifulwise January 17 2019  Ray Andrews the

facebookcomwilliamweitzel75  201901171329EST  Thanks for a wonderful article Very clear and gets at something very important  How long will using racial pride terms make sense to use for disadvantaged groups That is while generally  speaking or all things being equal it is easier to be a white man in the US than a black man it is certainly  much better to be black man today in the US than 100 years ago Which is to say some important progress  has been made So if or to the extent that equality is reached racial pride language will really become  troubling And perhaps racial pride terms are already more of an obstacle to living in the kind of world that  I think we all want to live in namely one in which we judge HUMAN beings on the basis of their moral  character  As an aside I nd the dead white guy trope so disappointing Reading older books can help us see that  there are permanent problems or questions and that easy solutions are oen more tension riddled than  we think People from the past can say true things or articulate questions and problems that are very much  with us today  The Platonic dialogues are absolutely outstanding at showing how unreasonable people can be For instance  most of the interlocutors dont actually admit their own ignorance Like Meno who says Im bewitched  Ive made thousands of speeches about virtue He doesnt admit he doesnt know and attributes  supernatural capacities to the person who refutes him Or Laches who says that the denition of courage is  just there on the tip of his tongue even though he has been soundly refuted Plato shows us how incredibly  Mike Dolphgren January 17 2019  William Weitzel January 17 2019  Leo Strauss January 17 2019  S H A R E     Privacy  Cookies This site uses cookies By continuing to use this

let go of emotional convictions that we have held for a long time especially if we are proud  of them Which is to say dead old white guys can say true things and it has nothing to do with their  whiteness  If the double standards of the type mentioned by Coleman continue more people will turn to the Titos of  the world It is not hard to imagine what will happen then  The only way to prevent this from happening is by doing what Coleman is doing taking a stand for  civilization  Coleman is speaking up for lessons hardlearned in the past to avoid ethnic violence we cannot hold  people of dierent ethnicities to dierent standards The only realistic alternative is by treating others as  individuals  It may be unpleasant to join Coleman and swim upstream of woke dogma but if we do not we will face a far  worse fate  A great way to instantly be seen as a naf a racist or both is to ask why this double standard exists The  answer of course is historical context Black people were brought to America in chains forced to work as  chattel subjugated formally and informally for a century aer abolition all the while ghting to see  themselves as beautiful in a culture hellbent on convincing them they were ugly stupid and inferior Black  race pride therefore is a rejection of and an adaptation to the racist elements in Americas reprehensible  past One cannot make the same claim about white race pride which historically has been more associated  with brutal oppression than with noble rebellion  Ah yes so the fact that serfdom in Europe lasted longer than slavery and that unlike slavery in the USA  members of other races didnt wage wage to liberate them is part of this brutal oppression Those serfs of  course were all part of the white race out their brutally oppressing To say nothing of the vast amounts of  European slavery by Africans in the past Or to say nothing of the abolition of Sati the Thuggees human  sacrice in Tahiti tribal genocide in New Zealandbut all this is beside the point The point is that  Coleman for all that he poses as antiidentitarian is going on here about the white race British US  Canadian Indian Nepalese NZ Australia soldiers ridding the world of German and Japanese  tyrannyforget that its all about the white race Stu any ne distinctions Saxons vs Daneswhite race  Cold war versus Stalinism white race The mix of good and bad of British Imperialism compared to the  unremitting bad of Belgian Imperialismall washed into one big homogeneous white race  Lets face it Coleman is a one trick pony exposed when he overreaches by his lack of

httpsquillettecom20190116tiersofprideandshame 4453  Your prideshame binary arguments rests to my mind on a rational view of human nature  Whether one feels pride or shame is up to the individual and doesnt necessarily answer to a rationalist  analysis of what emotions should comprise human nature  or what outward representations these  emotions should rightfully rest on  correspond to  Spending many hours exploring human nature in a therapeutic setting taught me that the emotions one  logically should feel are oen the least  important to what is actually going on  As an example taken from this paper you mention that Frederick Douglass and some other famous black  people are or were your heroes  Is that rational Does that make sense  I think pride is natural and shame is learned or both are natural but one is rstorder natural and the other  is secondorder natural I think love is rst order natural and hatred is learned or second order natural  learned through painful experience Black men of the past are of the same biological ilk and stamp as their  descendants today and therefore it seems natural to pride oneself on being created by God in that same  template  one can reasonably associate with their experiences and accomplishments  and put upon  oneself the mantle of their glory so to speak The rational calculus of what emotions should be might  disallow this But I think thats motivated more by the desire to appease a fraught societal consensus   hoping if we throw overboard the adolescent seeming gloryseeking of racial identication we can ease the  process of integration for everyone Perhaps  But the authors mind made an association between himself and Frederick Douglass Why was this easier for  him than say identifying with John Brown the abolitionist The mind is generally not rational I contend  Allow me speak with the widest angle lens I have about the issue  Races are ideas in the mind of God They are divine templates that are meant to express the manyfacetted  nature of the Human being  Each one has special gis and virtues which the other cannot have or create as easily Outside of human  value hierarchies all races are  equal as we are all in absolute spiritual equality with one another  all souls are created equal In our  expression both as individuals  groups and races  we are not equal Equal in essence value spirituality and potentiation  but not equal in  any of the visible expression metrics  upon which human societies generally base themselves Any two human beings even within a family would  be unequal on many metrics  These measures we see are our societys perhaps somewhat hamsted attempts to reconcile the spiritual  ideal of equality  which is truly absolute with the practical reality of peoples dierences  Also Races are very formidable We are talking about groups of humans These are the most powerful  beings on the planet and when you address them in their Racial aspect you address their group mind  you  touch one of the most profound primal centers of their being Each one is infused with a profound love of  the Archetype it represents  though its mind can be swayed by other things It will be drawn again and  again to the Archetype  SHARE     Privacy  Cookies This site uses cookies By continuing to use this website you agree to their use  To nd out more including how to control cookies see here

Races are formidable they have claws One should not play lightly with or abuse an advantage over  another group of people unless expecting to draw re down on oneself and possibly ones descendants  Imagine the alcoholsoaked greed and jollity of the early slave traders who made themselves rich yet the  wheels of discontent and anguish they set in motion would redound for hundreds of years  and

unwanted dissonant racial strangers is itself a  dividing act Its not a natural state You sound like a dumb boomer regurgitating something George Carlin  said in his standup acts  Conversely the progressive logic that encourages modernday whites to feel shame for slavery and  colonialism should also lead them to feel pride for their ancestors achievements  Too true Endlessly heckling white peiple implicitly gives them permission to defend themselves as  white  people and naturally some of them more marginal types will become radicalized In this atmosphere  Richard Spencer and white nationalists are as inevitable as Farrakhan and the Black Panthers  I suspect thats exactly what is desired by intersectional progressives who primarily dene themselves  opposite of bigotry and clearly desire more if it to further arm themselves and that Charlottesville was the  Nazi rally they were secretly hoping for  JD  I agree with this Attacking white people based on their race is causing many of them to begin to defensively  identify more and more heavily with their race when they otherwise would not have and I believe this is the  primary driver behind whatever white nationalist or whatever movement is currently on the rise to the  extent that it is actually on the rise at all The goal used to be clearly to move beyond judging people based  on race but now it

says people dont chose before birth to be x y or z and they did not inuence  the past or the glorious or inglorious deeds of the people who came before them I think in the case of  positive traits or deeds passed down to us the right word is thankful I am a biracial person black white I  am not proud of my ancestors black or white I am thankful to the them I am thankful they not only  reproduced but they had the fortitude to get up every morning and raise a family despite all the diculties  They made me possible At both the family level and the civilizational level the people who came before  me lived through events that shaped their lives for better or for worse I am the nal distillation of what they  experienced and how they chose to pass or not pass those experiences on I am thankful My turn now to  pick up the work  Political correctness is really getting to ridiculous levels I do not see any problem in people forming groups  to share the things they have in common no matter what they are I am an older person and not white and  I just dont see people through the color prism anymore If someone wants to rant about the virtues of being  white especially in college let them do so as long as there is nothing vicious or hateful or inciting violence  of any sort  Heck I might even stop and listen   Im surprised about the focus on skin color in article and comments Though as a social and cultural  phenomenon in the US easy to understand On a visit in the US I was amazed to see the denomination  Caucasian or black in passports is this still done  This Caucasian by the way in the original classication has skin color not at all as a distinctive race mark  neither IQ came much later but more facial and cranial characteristics blacks from the Horn of Africa  now Somalians pitch black also belonged to the Caucasian type so quite a dierence with that American  Caucasian However the hierarchy in races as preached here by some in the comments was nothing new  also then Caucasian was number one the most perfect and delicate race though at that time more to  dierentiate them from the ugly and primitive East Asians the Mongoloids the ones with that high IQ right  now than with the Negroids The times they are achanging  I think black pride makes some sense because in some ways blacks in America are more than racial group  but a semicohesive cultural and social group with a history a religion a literature and a music White pride  makes no sense in that whites are not a semicohesive cultural group As a Jew I take pride as do many Jews  in our Jewish winners

Fantastic writing  What called my attention was that the writer in sharing his experience of his student days claims not to  have heard more than one instance of racist speech It is very possible that his report is accurate but more  likely it is a reduced understanding of what racism means  As I understand it Racism is an institutionalized control of access to resources organized around perceived  identication with a particular race A phenomenon that accompanies this system of privilege is a blindness  to what you take for granted that privilege So I am not surprised that anyone used to conceiving the world  as racist would not see the racism in it and would not notice that specic speech utterances are not the only  elements that maintain said system of privilege  Whites are racist because the society they built as advanced a von Abele might think it is is based on only  allowing Whites to control resources It is a system of privilege If you are white you are born with a  silver spoon whether you take your socioeconomic class into account or not because the path of least  resistance is for you to have an advantage over someone from another group in the same class standing  The system is not only limited to giving privileges to Whites as based on race it is also skewed to giving  privileges to straight males which is based on another social construct gender  Excellent

cultures around the world deeply revere respect and honor their elders and  ancestors Why is this wrong  I would dispute the idea that there is such a thing as whiteness at all There is such a thing as culture and  subculture Culture is dierent from race Many authentically identify with many cultures simultaneously  myself included There is such a thing as American culture English culture French culture Spanish culture  German culture and so on The concept of European civilization strikes me as deeply amorphous  imprecise multimodal and non descriptive White culture and civilization far more so than the  European handle  For this reason taking pride in the achievements of ancient whites makes little sense But taking pride in  the accomplishment of ancient Romans Gauls Germanics English Greeks Greek Turks Anatolia was  culturally greek for thousands of years Serbs is not wrong Taking pride in whiteness strikes me as  bizarre and meaningless  We can honor our ancestors long gone without constantly condemning their mistakes Feeling guilt over the  actions of ancestors long gone makes no sense Why cant we feel gratitude respect and pride without guilt  You are right that the greatness of our ancestors is their greatness not ours We need this humility alongside  respecting our ancestors  Long have I pondered how and why it is that perceived humanity leaves race in the dust Culture language  traditions rituals diets customs habitsmean everything or dont mean anything depending on the  human stamp upon it It takes a little looking beneath the surface of things Arguments

another man for the enjoyment of its hidden secrets and deepest love Miserable is the woman who arises from the inattenti veness and restlessness of youth and finds herself in the home of a man

to the dictates of his heart but busied himself in obeying the voices of his environment H e amused himself with shimmering objects that blinded his eyes and heart to lifes secrets his soul was diverted away from an understanding of the law of nature and to a temporary selfgratification He was one of those men who hastened to confess thei r love or disgust to the people then regretted their impulsiveness when it was too late for recall And then shame and ridicule befell them instead of pardon or sanction  These are the characteristics that prompted Rashid Bey Namaan to marry Rose Hanie far before her soul emraced his soul in the shadow of the true love that makes union a paradise  After a few years of absence I returned to the City of Beyrouth As I went to visit Rashid Bey Namaan I found him pale and thin On his face one could see the spectre of bitter disappointment his sorrowful eyes bespoke his crushed heart and melan choly soul I was curious to find the cause for his miserable plight however I did not hesitate to ask for explanation and said What became of you Rashid Where is the radiant smile and the happy countenance that accompanied you since childhood H as death taken away from you a dear friend Or have the black nights stolen from you the gold you have amassed during the white days In the name of friendship tell me what is causing this sadness of heart and weakness of body  He looked at me ruefully as if I had revived to him some secluded images of beautiful days With a distressed and faltering voice he responded When a person loses a friend he consoles himself with the many other friends about him and if he loses his gold he meditates for a while and casts misfortune from his mind especially when he finds himself healthy and still laden with ambition But when a man loses the ease of his heart where can he find comfort and with what can he replace it What mind can master it When death strikes close by you will suffer But when the day and the night pass you will feel the smooth touch of the soft fingers of Life then you will smile and rejoice    7192020 Spirits Rebellious by Khalil Gibran  newthoughtlibrarycomgibranKhalilspiritsRebellious 211  Destiny comes suddenly bringing concern she stares at you with horrible eyes and clutches you at the throat with sharp fingers and hurls you to the ground and tramples upon you with ironclad feet then she laughs and walks away but later regrets h er actions and asks you through good fortune to forgive her She stretches her silky hand and lifts you high and sings to you the Song of Hope and causes you to lose your cares She creates in you a new zest for confidence and ambition If your lot in life is a beautiful bird that you love dearly you gladly feed to him the seeds of your inner self and make your heart his cage and your soul his nest But while you are affectionately admiring him and looking upon him with the eyes of love he escapes from your hands and flies very high then he descends and enters into another cage and never comes back to you What can you do Where can you find patience and condolence How can you revive your hopes and dreams What power can still your turbulent heart  Having uttered these words with a choking voice and suffering spirit Rashid Bey Namaan stood shaking like a reed between the north and south wind He extended his hands as if to grasp something with his bent fingers and destroy it His wrinkled fac e was livid his eyes grew larger as he stared a few moments and it seemed to him as if he saw a demon appearing from nonexistence to take him away then he fixed his eyes on mine and his appearance suddenly changed his anger was converted into keen suf fering and distress and he cried out saying It is the woman whom I rescued from between the deathly paws of poverty I opened my coffers to her and made her envied by all women for the beautiful raiment and precious gems and magnificent carriages drawn by spirited horses the woman whom my heart has loved and at whose feet I poured affection the woman to whom I was a true friend sincere companion and a faithful husband The woman who betrayed me and departed me for another man to share with him dest itution and partake his evil bread kneaded with shame and mixed with disgrace The woman I loved the beautiful bird whom I fed and to whom I made my heart a cage and my soul a nest has escaped from my hands and entered into another cage that pure an gel who resided in the paradise of my affection and love now appears to me as a horrible demon descended into the darkness to suffer for her sin and cause me to suffer on earth for her crime  He hid his face with his hands as if wanting to protect himself from himself and became silent for a moment Then he sighed and said This is all I can tell you please do not ask anything further Do not make a crying voice of my calamity but le t it rather be mute misfortune perhaps it will grow in silence and deaden me away so that I may rest at last with peace  I rose with tears in my eyes and mercy in my heart and silently bade him goodbye my words had no power to console his wounded heart and my knowledge had no torch to illuminate his gloomy self  Part Two  A few days thereafter I met Madame Rose Hanie for the first time in a poor hovel surrounded by flowers and trees She had heard of me through Rashid Bey Namaan the man whose heart she had crushed and stamped upon and left under the terrible hoofs of Life As I looked at her beautiful bright eyes and heard her sincere voice I said to myself Can this be the sordid woman Can this clear face hide an ugly soul and a criminal heart Is this the unfaithful wife Is this the woman of whom I have spoken evil and imagined as a serpent disguised in the form of a beautiful bird Then I whispered again to myself saying Is it this beautiful face that made Rashid Bey Namaan miserable Havent we heard that obvious beauty is the cause of many hidden distresses and deep suffering Is not the beautiful moon that inspires the poets the same moon that angers the silence of the sea with a terrible roar  As we seated ourselves Madame Rose Hanie seemed to have heard and read my thoughts and wanted not to prolong my doubts She leaned her beautiful head upon her hands and with a voice sweeter than the sound of the lyre she said I have never met you but I heard the echoes of your thoughts and dreams from the mouths of the people and they convinced me that you are merciful and have understanding for the oppressed woman  the woman whose hearts secrets you have discovered and whose affections you have known Allow me to reveal to you the full contents of my heart so you may know that Rose Hanie never was an unfaithful woman  I was scarcely eighteen years of age when fate led me to Rashid Bey Namaan who was then forty years old He fell in love with me according to what the people say and took me for a wife and put me in his magnificent home placing at my disposal clothes and precious gems He exhibited me as a strange rarity at the homes of his friends and family he smiled with triumph when he saw his contemporaries looking at me with surprise and admiration he lifted his chin high with pride when he heard the ladies speak of me with praise and affection But never could he hear the whispers Is this the wife of Rashid Bey Namaan or his adopted daughter And another one commenting If he had married at the proper age his first born would have been older than Rose Hanie  All that happened before my life had awakened from the deep swoon of youth and before God inflamed my heart with the torch of love and before the growth of the seeds of my affections Yes all this transpired during the time when I believed that real happiness came through beautiful clothes and magnificent mansions When I woke up from the slumber of childhood I felt the flames of sacred fire burning in my heart and a spiritual hunger gnawing at my soul making it suffer When I opened my eyes I found my wings moving to the right and left trying to ascend into the spacious firmament of love but shivering and dropping under the gusts of the shackles of laws that bound my body to a man before I knew the true meaning of that law I felt all these things and knew that a womans happiness does not come through mans glory and honour nor through his generosity and affection but through love that unites both of their hearts and affections making them one member of lifes body and one word upon the lips of God When Truth showed herself to me I found myself imprisoned by law in the mansion of Rashid Bey Namaan like a thief stealing his bread and hiding in the dark and friendly corners of the night I knew that every hour spent with him was a terrible lie written upon my forehead with letters of fire before heaven and earth I could not give him my love and affection in reward for his generosity and sincerity I tried in vain to love him but love is a power that makes our hearts yet our hearts cannot make that power I prayed and prayed in the silence of the night before God to create in the depths of my heart a spiritual attachment that would carry me closer to the man who had been chosen for me as a companion through life  My prayers were not granted because Love descends upon our souls by the will of God and not by the demand or the plea of the individual Thus I remained for two years in the home of that man envying the birds of the field their freedom while my friends    7192020 Spirits Rebellious by Khalil Gibran  newthoughtlibrarycomgibranKhalilspiritsRebellious 311  envied me my painful chains of gold I was like a woman who is torn from her only child like a lamenting heart existing without attachment like an innocent victim of the severity of human law I was close to death from spiritual thirst and hunger  One dark day as I looked behind the heavy skies I saw a gentle light pouring from the eyes of a man who was walking forlornly on the path of life I closed my eyes to that light and said to myself Oh my soul darkness of the grave is thy lot do not be greedy for the light Then I heard a beautiful melody from heaven that revived my wounded heart with its purity but I closed my ears and said Oh my soul the cry of the abyss is thy lot do not be greedy for heavenly songs I closed my eyes again so I could not see and shut my ears so I could not hear but my closed eyes still saw that gentle light and my ears still heard that divine sound I was frightened for the first time and felt like the beggar who found a precious jewel near the Emirs palace and could not pick it up on account of fear or leave it because of poverty I cried  a cry of a thirsty soul who sees a brook surrounded by wild beasts and falls upon the ground waiting and watching fearfully  Then she turned her eyes away from me as if she remembered the past that made her ashamed to face me but she continued Those people who go to back to eternity before they taste the sweetness of real life are unable to understand the meaning of a womans suffering Especially when she devotes her soul to a man she loves by the will of God and her body to another whom she caresses by the enforcement of earthly law It is a tragedy written with the blood of the womans blood and tears which the man reads with ridicule because he cannot understand it yet if he does understand his laughter will turn into scorn and blasphemy that act like fire upon her heart It is a drama enacted by the black nights upon the stage of a womans soul whose body is tied up into a man known to her as husband ere she perceives Gods meaning of marriage She finds her soul hovering about the man whom she adores by all agencies of pure and true love and beauty It is a terrible agony that began with the existence of weakness in a woman and the commencement of strength in a man It will not end unless the days of slavery and superiority of the strong over the weak are abolished It is a horrible war between the corrupt law of humanity and the sacred affections and holy purpose of the heart In such a battlefield I was lying yesterday but I gathered the remnants of my strength and unchained my irons of cowardice and untied my wings from the swaddles of weakness and arose into the spacious sky of love and freedom  Today I am one with the man I love he and I sprang out as one torch from the hand of God before the beginning of the world There is no power under the sun that can take my happiness from me because it emanated from two embraced spirits engulfed by understanding radiated by Love and protected by heaven  She looked at me as if she wanted to penetrate my heart with her eyes in order to to discover the impression of her words upon me and to hear the echo of her voice from within me but I remained silent and she continued Her voice was full of bitterness of memory and sweetness of sincerity and freedom when she said The people will tell you that Rose Hanie is an heretic and unfaithful woman who followed her desires by leaving the man who elated her into him and made her the elegance of his home They will tell you that she is an adulteress and prostitute who destroyed with her filthy hands the wreath of a sacred marriage and replaced it with a besmirched union woven of the thorns of hell She took off the garment of virtue and put on the cloak of sin and disgrace They will tell you more than that because the ghosts of their fathers are still living in their bodies They are like the deserted caves of the mountains that echo voices whose meanings are not understood They neither understand the law of God nor comprehend the true intent of veritable religion nor distinguish between a sinner and an innocent They look only at the surface of objects without knowing their secrets They pass their verdicts with ignorance and judge with blindness making the criminal and the innocent the good and the bad equal Woe to those who prosecute and judge the people     In Gods eyes I was unfaithful and an adulteress only while at the home of Rashid Bey Namaan because he made me his wife according to the customs and traditions and by the force of haste before heaven had made him mine in conformity with the spiritual law of Love and Affection I was a sinner in the eyes of God and myself when I ate his bread and offered him my body in reward for his generosity Now I am pure and clean because the law of Love has freed me and made me honourable and faithful I ceased selling my body for shelter and my days for clothes Yes I was an adulteress and a criminal when the people viewed me as the most honourable and faithful wife today I am pure and noble in spirit but in their opinion I am polluted for they judge the soul by the outcome of the body and measure the spirit by the standard of matter  Then she looked through the window and pointed out with her right hand toward the city as if she had seen the ghost of corruption and the shadow of shame among its magnificent buildings She said pityingly Look at those majestic mansions and sublime palaces where hypocrisy resides in those edifices and between their beautifully decorated walls resides Treason beside Putridity under the ceiling painted with melted gold lives Falsehood beside Pretension Notice those gorgeous homes that represent happiness glory and domination they are naught but caverns of misery and distress They are plastered graves in which Treason of the weak woman hides behind her kohled eyes and crimsoned lips in their corners selfishness exists and the animality of man through his gold and silver rules supreme  If those high and impregnable buildings scented the odor of hatred deceit and corruption they would have cracked and fallen The poor villager looks upon those residences with tearful eyes but when he finds that the hearts of the occupants are empty of that pure love that exists in the heart of his wife and fills its domain he will smile and go back to his fields contented  And then she took hold of my hand and led me to the side of the window and said Come I will show you the unveiled secrets of those people whose path I refused to follow Look at that palace with giant columns IN it lives a rich man who inherited his gold from his father After having led a life of filth and putrefaction he married a woman about whom he knew nothing except that her father was one of the Sultans dignitaries As soon as the wedding trip was over he became disgusted and commenced associations with women who sell their bodies for pieces of silver His wife was left alone in that palace like an empty bottle left by a drunkard She cried and suffered for the first time then she realized that her tears were more precious than her degenerate husband Now she is busying herself in the love and devotion of a young man upon whom she showers her joyous hours and into whose heart she pours her sincere love and affection    7192020 Spirits Rebellious by Khalil Gibran  newthoughtlibrarycomgibranKhalilspiritsRebellious 411  Let me take you now to that gorgeous home surrounded by beautiful gardens It is the home of a man who comes from a noble family which ruled the country for many generations but whose standards wealth and prestige have declined due to their indulgence in mad spending and slothfulness A few years ago this man married an ugly but rich woman After he acquired her fortune he ignored her completely and commenced devoting himself to an attractive young woman His wife today is devoting her time to curling her hair painting her lips and perfuming her body She wears the most expensive clothes and hopes that some young man will smile and come to visit her but it is all in vain for she cannot succeed except in receiving a smile from her ugly self in the mirror  Observe that big manor encircled with the marble statuary it is the home of a beautiful woman who posseses strange character When her first husband died she inherited all his money and estate then she selected a man with a weak mind and feeble body and became his wife to protect herself from the evil tongues and to use him as a shield for her abominations She is now among her admirers like a bee that sucks the sweetest and most delicious flowers  That beautiful home next to it was built by the greatest architect in the province it belongs to a greedy and substantial man who devotes all of his time to amassing gold and grinding the faces of the poor He has a wife of supernatural beauty bodily and spiritually but she is like the rest a victim of early marriage Her father committed a crime by giving her away to a man before she attained understanding age placing on her neck the heavy yoke of corrupt marriage She is thin and pale now and cannot find an outlet for her imprisoned affection She is sinking slowly and craving for death to free her from the mesh of slavery and deliver her from a man who spends his life gathering gold and cursing the hour he married a barren woman who could not bring him a child to carry on his name and inherit his money  In that home among the orchards lives an ideal poet he married an ignorant woman who ridicules his works because she cannot understand them and laughs at his conduct because she cannot adjust herself to his sublime way of life That poet found freedom from despair in his love for a married woman who appreciates his intelligence and inspires him by kindling in his heart the torch of affections and revealing to him the most beautiful and eternal sayings by means of her charm and beauty  Silence prevailed for a few moments and Madame Hanie seated herself on a sofa by the window as if her soul were tired of roaming those quarters Then she slowly continued These are the residences in which I refused to live these are the graves in which I too was spiritually buried These people from whom I have freed myself are the ones who become attracted by the body and repelled by the spirit and who know naught of Love and Beauty The only mediator between them and God is Gods pity for their ignorance of the law of God I cannot judge for I was one of them but I sympathize with all my heart I do not hate them but I hate their surrender to weakness and falsehood I have said all these things to show you the reality of the people from whom I have escaped against their will I was trying to explain to you the life of persons who speak every evil against me because I have lost their friendship and finally gained my own I emerged from their dark dungeon and directed my eyes towards the light where sincerity truth and justice prevail They have exiled me now from their society and I am pleased because humanity does not exile except the one whose noble spirit rebels against despotism and oppression He who does not prefer exile to slavery is not free by any measure of freedom truth and duty  Yesterday I was like a tray containing all kinds of palatable foods and Rashid Bey Namaan never approached me unless he felt a need for that food yet both of our souls remained far apart from us like two humble dignified servants I have tried to reconcile myself to what people call misfortune but my spirit refused to spend all its life kneeling with me before a horrible idol erected by the dark ages and called LAW I kept my chains until I heard Love calling me and saw my spirit preparing to embark Then I broke them and walked out from Rashid Bey Namaans home like a bird freed from his iron cage and leaving behind me all the gems clothes and servants I came to live with my beloved for I knew that what I was doing was honest Heaven does not want me to weep and suffer Many times at night I prayed for dawn to come and when dawn came I prayed for the day to be over God does not want me to lead a miserable life for He placed in the depths of my heart a desire for happiness His glory rests in the happiness of my heart  This is my story and this is my protest before heaven and earth this is what I sing and repeat while people are closing their ears for fear of hearing me and leading their spirits into rebellion that would crumble the foundation of their quavering society  This is the rough pathway I have carved until I reached the mountain peak of my happiness Now if death comes to take me away I will be more than willing to offer myself before the Supreme Throne of Heaven without fear or shame I am ready for the day of judgment and my heart is white as the snow I have obeyed the will of God in everything I have done and followed the call of my heart while listening to the angelic voice of heaven This is my drama which the people of Beyrouth call A curse upon the lips of life and An ailment in the body of society But one day love will arouse their hearts like the sun rays that bring forth the flowers even from contaminated earth One day the wayfarers will stop by my grave and greet the earth that enfolds my body and say Here lies Rose Hanie who freed herself from the slavery of decayed human laws in order to comply with Gods law of pure love She turned her face toward the sun so she would not see the shadow of her body amongst the skulls and thorns    The door opened and a man entered His eyes were shining with magic rays and upon his lips appeared a wholesome smile Madame Hanie rose took the young mans arm and introduced him to me then gave him my name with flattering words I knew that he was the one for whose sake she denied the whole world and violated all earthly laws and customs  As we sat down silence controlled Each one of us was engrossed in deep thought One minute worthy of silence and respect had passed when I looked at the couple sitting side by side I saw something I had never seen before and realized instantly the meaning of Madame Hanies story I comprehended the secret of her protest against the society which persecutes those who rebel against    7192020 Spirits Rebellious by Khalil Gibran  newthoughtlibrarycomgibranKhalilspiritsRebellious 511  confining laws and customs before determining the cause for the rebellion I saw one heavenly spirit before me composed of two beautiful and united persons in the midst of which stood the god of Love stretching his wings over them to protect them from evil tongues I found a complete understanding emanating from two smiling faces illuminated by sincerity and surrounded by virtue For the first time in my life I found the phantom of happiness standing between a man and a woman cursed by religion and opposed by the law I rose and bade them goodbye and left that poor hovel which Affection had erected as an altar to Love and Understanding I walked past the buildings which Madame Hanie pointed out to me As I reached the end of these quarters I remembered Rashid Bey Namaan and meditated his miserable plight and said to myself He is oppressed will heaven ever listen to him if he complains about Madame Hanie Had that woman done wrong when she left him and followed the freedom of her heart Or did he commit a crime by subduing her heart into love Which of the two is the oppressed and which is the oppressor Who is the criminal and who is the innocent  Then I resumed talking to myself after a few moments of deep thinking Many times deception had tempted woman to leave her husband and follow wealth because her love for riches and beautiful raiment blinds her and leads her into shame Was Madame Hanie deceitful when she left her rich husbands palace for a poor mans hut Many times igorance kills a womans honour and revives her passion she grows tired and leaves her husband prompted by her desires and follows a man to whom she lowers herself Was Madame Hanie an ignorant woman following her physical desires when she declared publicly her independence and joined her beloved young man She could have satisfied herself secretly while at her husbands home for many men were willing to be the slaves of her beauty and martyrs of her love Madame Hanie was a miserable woman She sought only happiness found it and embraced it This is the very truth which society disrespects Then I whispered through the ether and inquired of myself Is it permissible for a woman to buy her happiness with her husbands misery And my soul added Is it lawful for a man to enslave his wifes affection when he realizes he will never possess it   I continued walking and Madame Hanies voice was still sounding in my ears when I reached the extreme end of the city The sun was disappearing and silence ruled the fields and prairies while the birds commenced singing their evening prayers I stood there meditating and then I sighed and said Before the throne of Freedom the trees rejoice with the frolicsome breeze and enjoy the rays of the sun and the beams of the moon Through the ears of Freedom these birds whisper and around Freedom they flutter to the music of the brooks Throughout the sky of Freedom these flowers breathe their fragrance and before Freedoms eyes they smile when day comes  Everything lives on earth according to the law of nature and from that law emerges the glory and joy of liberty but man is denied this fortune because he set for the Godgiven soul a limited and earthly law of his own He made for himself strict rules Man built a narrow and painful prison in which he secluded his affections and desires He dug out a deep grave in which he buried his heart and its purpose If an individual through the dictates of his soul declares his withdrawal from society and violates the law his fellowmen will say he is a rebel worthy of exile or an infamous creature worthy only of execution Will man remain a slave of selfconfinement until the end of the world Or will he be freed by the passing of time and live in the Spirit for the Spirit Will man insist upon staring downward and backward at the earth Or will he turn his eyes toward the sun so he will not see the shadow of his body amongst the skulls and thorns  Return to the Top Return to the Top  Chapter 2  The Cry of the Graves  Part One  The Emir walked into the court room and took the central chair while at his right and left sat the wise men of the country The guards armed with swords and spears stood in attention and the people who came to witness the trial rose and bowed ceremoniously to the Emir whose eyes emanated a power that revealed horror to their spirits and fear to their hearts As the court came to order and the hour of judgment approached the Emir raised his hand and shouted saying Bring forth the criminals singly and tell me what crimes they have committed The prison door opened like the mouth of a ferocious yawning beast In the obscure corners of the dungeon one could hear the echo of shackles rattling in unison with the moaning and lamentations of the prisoners The spectators were eager to see the prey of Death emerging from the depths of that inferno A few moments later two soldiers came out leading a young man with his arms pinioned behind his back His stern face bespoke nobility of spirit and strength of the heart He was halted in the middle of the court room and the soldiers marched a few steps to the rear The Emir stared at him steadily and said What crime has this man who is proudly and triumphantly standing before me committed One of the courtmen responded He is a murderer yesterday he slew one of the Emirs officers who was on an important mission in the surrounding villages he was still grasping the bloody sword when he was arrested The Emir retorted with anger Return the man to the dark prison and tie him with heavy chains and at dawn cut off his head with his own sword and throw his body in the woods so that the beasts may eat the flesh and the air may carry its remindful odor into the noses of his family and friends The youth was returned to prison while the people looked upon him with sorroful eyes for he was a young man in the spring of life  The soldiers returned back again from the prison leading a young woman of natural and frail beauty She looked pale and upon her face appeared the signs of oppression and disappointment Her eyes were soaked with tears and her head was bent under the burden    7192020 Spirits Rebellious by Khalil Gibran  newthoughtlibrarycomgibranKhalilspiritsRebellious 611  of grief After eyeing her thoroughly the Emir exclaimed And this emaciated woman who is standing before me like the shadow beside a corpse what has she done One of the soldiers answered him saying She is an adulteress last night her husband discovered her in the arms of another After her lover excaped her husband turned her over to the law The Emir looked at her while she raised her face without expression and he ordered Take her back to the dark room and stretch her upon a bed of thorns so she may remember the resting place which she polluted with her fault give her vinegar mixed with gall to drink so she may remember the taste of those sweet kisses At dawn drag her naked body outside the city and stone her Let the wolves enjoy the tender meat of her body and the worms pierce her bones AS she walked back to the dark cell the people looked upon her with sympathy and surprise They were astonished with the Emirs justice and grieved over her fate The soldiers reappeared bringing with them a sad man with shaking knees and trembling like a tender sapling before the north wind He looked powerless sickly and frightened and he was miserable and poor The Emir stared at him loathfully and inquired And this filthy man who is like dead amongst the living what has he done One of the guards returned He is a thief who broke into the monastery and stole the sacred vases which the priests found under his garment when they arrested him  As a hungry eagle who looks at a bird with broken wings the Emir looked at him and said Take him back to the jail and chain him and at dawn drag him into a lofty tree and hang him between heaven and earth so his sinful hands may perish and the members of his body may be turned into particles and scattered by the wind As the thief stimbled back into the depths of the prison the people commenced whispering one to another saying How dare such a weak and heretic man steal the sacred vases of the monastery  At this time the court adjourned and the Emir walked out accompanied by all his wise men guarded by the soldiers while the audience scattered and the place became empty except of the moaning and wailing of the prisoners All this happened while I was standing there like a mirror before passing ghosts I was meditating the laws made by man for man contemplating what the people call justice and engrossing myself with deep thoughts of the secrets of life I tried to understand the meaning of the universe I was dumbfounded in finding myself lost like a horizon that disappears beyond the cloud As I left the place I said to myself The vegetable feeds upon the elements of the earth the sheep eats the vegetable the wolf preys upon the sheep and the bull kills the wolf while the lion devours the bull yet Death claims the lion Is there any power that will overcome Death and make these brutalities an eternal justice Is there a force that can convert all the ugly things into beautiful objects Is there any might that can clutch with its hands all the elements of life and embrace them with joy as the sea joyfully engulfs all the brooks into its depths Is there any power that can arrest the murdered and the murderer the adulteress and the adulterer the robber and the robbed and bring them to a court loftier and more supreme than the court of the Emir  The Cry of the Graves Part Two  The next day I left the city for the fields where silence reveals to the soul that which the spirit desires and where the pure sky kills the germs of despair nursed in the city by the narrow streets and obscured places When I reached the valley I saw a flock of crows and vultures soaring and descending filling the sky with cawing whistling and rustling of the wings As I proceeded I saw before me a corpse of a man hanged high in a tree the body of a dead naked woman in the midst of a heap of stones and a carcass of a youth with his head cut off and soaked with blood mixed with earth It was a horrible sight that blinded my eyes with a thick dark veil of sorrows I looked in every direction and saw naught except the spectre of Death standing by those ghastly remains Nothing could be heard except the wailing of nonexistence mingled with the cawing of crows hovering about the victims of human laws Three human beings who yesterday were in the lap of Life today fell as victims to Death because they broke the rules of human society When a man kills another man the people say he is a murderer but when the Emir kills him the Emir is just When a man robs a monastery they say he is a thief but when the Emir robs him of his life the Emir is honourable When a woman betrays her husband they say she is an adulteress but when the Emir makes her walk naked in the streets and stones her later the Emir is noble Shedding of blood is forbidden but who made it lawful for the Emir Stealing ones money is a crime but taking away ones life is a noble act Betrayal of a husband may be an ugly deed but stoning of living souls is a beautiful sight Shall we meet evil with evil and say this is the Law Shall we fight corruption with greater corruption and say this is the Rule Shall we conquer crimes with more crimes and say this is Justice Had not the Emir killed an enemy in his past life Had he not robbed his weak subjects of money and property Had he not committed adultery Was he infallible when he killed the murderer and hanged the thief in the tree Who are those who hanged the thief in the tree Are they angels descended from heaven or men looting and usurping Who cut off the murderers head Are they divine prophets or soldiers shedding blood wherever they go Who stoned that adulteress Were they virtuous hermits who came from their monasteries or humans who loved to commit atrocities with glee under the protection of ignorant Law What is Law Who saw it coming with the sun from the depths of heaven What human saw the heart of God and found its will or purpose In what century did the angels walk among the people and preach to them saying Forbid the weak from enjoying life and kill the outlaws with the sharp edge of the sword and step upon the sinners with iron feet  As my mind suffered in this fashion I heard a rustling of feet in the grass close by I took heed and saw a young woman coming from behind the trees she looked carefully in every direction before she approached the three carcasses that were there As she glanced she saw the youths head that was cut off She cried fearfully knelt and embraced it with her termbling arms then she commenced shedding tears and touching the bloodmatted curly hair with her soft fingers crying in a voice that came from the remnants of a shattered heart She could bear the sight no longer She dragged the body to a ditch and placed the head gently between the shoulders covered the entire body with earth and upon the grave she planted the sword with which the head of the young man had been cut off  As she started to leave I walked toward her She trembled when she saw me and her eyes were heavy with tears She sighed and said Turn me over to the Emir if you wish It is better for me to die and follow the one who saved my life from the grip of disgrace than to leave his corpse as food for the ferrocious beasts Then I responded Fear me not poor girl I have lamented the young man before you did But tell me how did he save you from the grip of disgrace She replied with a choking and fainting voice One of the Emirs officers came to our farm to collect the tax when he saw me he looked upon me as a wolf looks upon a lamb He imposed on    7192020 Spirits Rebellious by Khalil Gibran  newthoughtlibrarycomgibranKhalilspiritsRebellious 711  my father a heavy tax that even a rich man could not pay He arrested me as a token to take to the Emir in ransom for the gold which my father was unable to give I begged him to spare me but he took no heed for he had no mercy Then I cried for help and this young man who is dead now came for my help and saved me from a living death The officer attempted to kill him but this man took an old sword that was hanging on the wall of our home and stabbed him He did not run away like a criminal but stood by the dead officer until the law came and took him into custody Having uttered these words which would make any human heart bleed with sorrow she turned her face and walked away  In a few moments I saw a youth coming and hiding his face with a cloak As he approached the corpse of the adulteress he took off the garment and placed it upon her naked body Then he drew a dagger from under the cloak and dug a pit in which he placed the dead girl with tenderness and care and covered her with earth upon which he poured his tears When he finished his task he plucked some flowers and placed them reverently upon the grave As he started to leave I halted him saying What kin are you to this adulteress And what prompted you to endanger your life by coming here to protect her naked body from the ferrocious beasts  When he stared at me his sorrowful eyes bespoke his misery and he said I am the unfortunate man for whose love she was stoned I loved her and she loved me since childhood we grew together Love whom we served and revered was the lord of our hearts Love joined both of us and embraced our souls One day I absented myself from the city and upon my return I discovered that her father obliged her to marry a man she did not love My life became a perpetual struggle and all my days were converted into one long and dark night I tried to be at peace with my heart but my heart would not be still Finally I went to see her secretly and my sole purpose was to have a glimpse of her beautiful eyes and hear the sound of her serene voice When I reached her house I found her lonely lamenting her unfortunate self I sat by her silence was our important conversation and virtue our companion One hour of understanding quiet passed when her husband entered I cautioned him to contain himself but he dragged her with both hands into the street and cried out saying Come come and see the adulteress and her lover All the neighbours rushed about and later the law came and took her to the Emir but I was not touched by the soldiers The ignorant Law and sodden customs punished the woman for her fathers fault and pardoned the man  Having thus spoken the man turned toward the city while I remained pondering the corpse of the thief hanging in that lofty tree and moving slightly every time the wind shook the branches waiting for someone to bring him down and stretch him upon the bosom of the earth beside the Defender of Honour and Martyr of Love An hour later a frail and wretched woman appeared crying She stood before the hanged man and prayed reverently Then she struggled up into the tree and gnawed with her teeth on the linen rope until it broke and the dead fell on the ground like a huge wet cloth whereupon she came down dug a grave and buried the thief by the side of the other two victims After covering him with earth she took two pieces of wood and fashioned a cross and placed it over the head When she turned her face to the city and started to depart I stopped her saying What incited you to come and bury this thief She looked at me miserably and said He is my faithful husband and merciful companion he is the father of my children  five young ones starving to death the oldest is eight years of age and the youngest is still nursing My husband was not a thief but a farmer working in the monasterys land making our living on what little food the priests and monks gave him when he returned home at eventide He had been farming for them since he was young and when he became weak they dismissed him advising him to go back home and send his children to take his place as soon as they grew older He begged them in the name of Jesus and the angels of heaven to let him stay but they took no heed of his plea They had no mercy on him nor on his starving children who were helplessly crying for food He went to the city seeking employment but in vain for the rich did not employ except the strong and the healthy Then he sat on the dusty street stretching his hand toward all who passed begging and repeating the sad song of his defeat in life while suffering from hunger and humiliation but the people refused to help him saying that lazy people did not deserve alms On night hunger gnawed painfully at our children especially the youngest who tried hopelessly to nurse on my dry breast My husbands expression changed and he left the house under the cover of the night He entered the monasterys bin and carried out a bushel of wheat As he emerged the monks woke up from their slumber and arrested him after beating him mercilessly At dawn they brought him to the Emir and complained that he came to the monastery to steal the golden vases of the altar He was placed in prison and hanged the second day He was trying to fill the stomachs of his little hungry one with the wheat he had raised by his own labour but the Emir killed him and used his flesh as food to fill the stomachs of the birds and the beasts Having spoken in this manner she left me alone in a sorrowful plight and departed  I stood there before the graves like a speaker suffering wordlessness while trying to recite a eulogy I was speechless but my falling tears substitute for my words and spoke for my soul My spirit rebelled when I attempted to meditate a while because the soul is like a flower that folds its petals when dark comes and breathes not its fragrance into the phantoms of the night I felt as if the earth that enfolded the victims of oppression in that lonely place were filling my ears with sorrowful tunes of suffering souls and inspiring me to talk I resorted to silence but if the people understood what silence reveals to them they would have been as close to God as the flowers of the valleys If the flames of my sighing soul had touched the trees they would have moved from their places and marched like a strong army to fight the Emir with their branches and tear down the monastery upon the heads of those priests and monks I stood there watching and felt that the sweet feeling of mercy and the bitterness of sorrow were pouring from my heart upon the newly dug graves  a grave of a young man who sacrificed his life in defending a weak maiden whose life and honour he had saved from between the paws and teeth of a savage human a youth whose head was cut off in reward for his bravery and his sword was planted upon his grave by the one he saved as a symbol of heroism before the face of the sun that shines upon an empire laden with stupidity and corruption A grave of a young woman whose heart was inflamed with love before her body was taken by greed usurped by lust and stoned by tyranny    She kept her faith until death her lover placed flowers upon her grave to speak through their withering hours of those souls whom Love had selected and blessed among a people blinded by earthly substance and muted by ignorance A grave of a miserable man weakened by hard labour in the monasterys land who asked for bread to feed his hungry little ones and was refused He resorted to begging but the people took no heed When his soul led him to restore a small part of the crop which he had raised and gathered he was arrested and beaten to death His poor widow erected a cross upon his head as a witness in the silence of the night before the stars of heaven to testify against those priests who converted the kind teaching of Christ into sharp swords by which they cut the peoples necks and tore the bodies of the weak    7192020 Spirits Rebellious by Khalil Gibran  newthoughtlibrarycomgibranKhalilspiritsRebellious 811  The sun disappeared behind the horizon as if tiring of the worlds troubles and loathing the peoples submission At that moment the evening began to weave a delicate veil from the sinews of silence and sread it upon Natures body I stretched my hand toward the graves pointing at their symbols lifted my eyes toward heaven and cried out Oh Bravery this is your sword buried now in the earth Oh Love these are your flowers scorched by fire Oh Lord Jesus this is Thy cross submerged in the obscurity of the night   Return to the Top Return to the Top  Chapter 3  Khalil The Heretic  Part One  Sheik Abbas was looked upon as a prince by the people of a solitary village in North Lebanon His mansion stood in the midst of those poor villagers huts like a healthy giant amidst the sickly dwarfs He lived amid luxury while they pursued an existence of penury They obeyed him and bowed reverently before him as he spoke to them It seemed as though the power of mind had appointed him its official interpreter and spokesman His anger would make them tremble and scatter like autumn leaves before a strong wind If he were to slap ones face it would be heresy on the individuals part to move or lift his head or make any attempt to discover why the blow had come If he smiled at a man the villagers would consider the person thus honoured as the most fortunate The peoples fear and surrender to Sheik Abbas were not due to weakness however their poverty and need of him had brought about this state of continual humiliation Even the huts they lived in and the fields they cultivated were owned by Sheik Abbas who had inherited them from his ancestors  The farming of the land and the sowing of the seeds and the gathering of wheat were all done under the supervision of the Sheik who in reward for their toil compensated them with a small portion of the crop which barely kept them from falling as victims of gnawing starvation  Often many of them were in need of bread before the crop was reaped and they came to Sheik Abbas and asked him with pouring tears to advance them a few piastres or a bushel of wheatm and the Sheik gladly granted their request for he knew that they would pay their debts doubly when harvest time came Thus those people remained obligated all their lives left a legacy of debts to their children and were submissive to their master whose anger they had always feared and whose friendship and good will they had constantly but unsuccessfully endeavoured to win  Part Two  Winter came and brought heavy snow and strong winds the valleys and the fields became empty of all things except leafless trees which stood as spectres of death above the lifeless plains  Having stored the products of the land in the Sheiks bins and filled his vases with the wine of the vineyards the villagers retreated to their huts to spend a portion of their lives idling by the fireside and commemorating the glory of the past ages and relating to one another the tales of weary days and long nights  The old year had just breathed its last into the grey sky The night had arrived during which the New Year would be crowned and placed upon the throne of the Universe The snow began to fall heavily and the whistling winds were racing from the lofty mountains down to the abyss and blowing the snow into heaps to be stored away in the valleys  The trees were shaking under the heavy storms and the fields and knolls were covered with a white floor upon which Death was writing vague lines and effacing them The mists stood as partitions between the scattered villages by the sides of the valleys The lights that flickered through the windows of those wretched huts disappeared behind the thick veil of Natures wrath  Fear penetrated the fellahins hearts and the animals stood by their mangers in the sheds while the dogs were hiding in the corners One could hear the voices of the sreaming winds and thundering of the storms resounding from the depths of the valleys It seemed as if Nature were enraged by the passing of the old year and trying to wrest revenge from those peaceful souls by fighting with weapons of cold and frost  That night under ths raging sky a young man was attempting to walk the winding trail that connected Deir Kizhaya with Sheik Abbas village The youths limbs were numbed with cold while pain and hunger usurped him of his strength The black raiment he wore was bleached with the falling snow as if he were shrouded in death before the hour of his death had come He was struggling against the wind His progress was difficult and he took but a few steps forward with each effort He called for help and then stood silent shivering in the cold night He had slim hope withering between great despair and deep sorrow He was like a bird with a broken wing who fell in a stream whose whirlpools carried him down to the depths  The young man continued walking and falling until his blood stopped circulating and he collapsed He uttered a terrible sound    the voice of a soul who encountered the hollow face of Death    a voice of dying youth weakened by man and trapped by nature    a voice of the love of existence in the space of nothingness  Part Three    7192020 Spirits Rebellious by Khalil Gibran  newthoughtlibrarycomgibranKhalilspiritsRebellious 911  On the north side of that village in the midst of the windtorn fields stood the solitary home of a woman named Rachel and her daughter Miriam who had not then attained the age of eighteen Rachel was the widow of Samaan Ramy who was found slain six years earlier but the law of man did not find the murderer  Like the rest of the Lebanese widows Rachel sustained life through long hard work During the harvest season she would look for ears of corn left behind by others in the field and in Autumn she gathered the remnants of some forgotten fruits in the gardens In Winter she spun wool and made raiment for which she received a few piastres or a bushel of grain Miriam her daughter was a beautiful girl who shared with her mother the burden of toil  That bitter night the two women were sitting by the fireplace whose warmth was weakened by the frost and whose firebrands were buried beneath the ashes By their side was a flickering lamp that sent its yellow dimmed rays into the heart of darkness like a prayer that sends phantoms of hope into the hearts of the sorrowful  Midnight had come and they were listening to the wailing winds outside Every now and then Miriam would get up open the small transom and look toward the obscured sky and then she would return to her chair worried and frightened by the raging elements Suddenly Miriam started as if she had awakened from a swoon of deep slumber She looked anxiously toward her mother and said Did you hear that Mother Did you hear a voice calling for help The mother listened a moment and said I hear nothing but the crying wind my daughter Then Miriam exclaimed I heard a voice deeper than the thundering heaven and more sorrowful than the wailing of the tempest  Having uttered these words she stood up and opened the door and listened for a moment Then she said I hear it again Mother Rachel hurried toward the frail door and after a moments hesitation she said And I hear it too Let us go and see  She wrapped herself with a long robe opened the door and walked out cautiously while Miriam stood at the door the wind blowing her long hair  Having forced her way a short distance through the snow Rachel stopped and shouted out Who is calling    where are you There was no answer then she repeated the same words again and again but she heard naught except thunder Then she courageously advanced forward looking in every direction She had walked for some time when she found some deep footprints upon the snow she followed them fearfullly and in a few moments found a human body lying before her on the snow like a patch on a white dress As she appraoched him and leaned his head over her knees she felt his pulse that bespoke his slowing heart beats and his slim chance in life She turned her face toward the hut and called Come Miriam come and help me I have found him Miriam rushed out and followed her mothers footprints while shivering with cold and trembling with fear As she reached the place and saw the youth lying motionless she cried with an aching voice The mother put her hands under his armpits calmed Miriam and said Fear not for he is still living hold the lower edge of his cloak and let us carry him home  Confronted with the strong wind and heavy snow the two women carried the youth and started toward the hut As they reached the little haven they laid him down by the fireplace Rachel coomenced rubbing his numbed hands and Miriam drying his hair with the end of her dress The youth began to move after a few minutes His eyelids quivered and he took a deep sigh  a sigh that brought the hope of his safety into the hearts of the merciful women They removed his shoes and took off his black robe Miriam looked at her mother and said Observe his raiment Mother these clothes are worn by the monks After feeding the fire with a bundle of dry sticks Rachel looked at her daughter with perplexity and said The monks do not leave their convent on such a terrible night And Miriam inquired But he has no hair on his face the monks wear beards The mother gazed at him with eyes full of mercy and maternal love then she turned to her daughter and said It makes no difference whether he is a monk or a criminal dry his feet well my daughter Rachel opened a closet took from it a jar of wine and poured some in an earthenware bowl Miriam held his head while the mother gave him some of it to stimulate his heart As he sipped the wine he opened his eyes for the first time and gave his rescuers a sorrowful look mingled with tears of gratitude  the look of a human who felt the smooth touch of life after having been gripped in the sharp claws of death  a look of great hope after hope had died Then he bent his head and his lips trembled when he uttered the words May God bless both of you Rachel placed her hand upon his shoulder and said Be calm brother Do not tire yourself with talking until you gain strength And Miriam added Rest your head on this pillow brother and we will place you closer to the fire Rachel refilled the bowl with wine and gave it to him She looked at her daughter and said Hang his robe by the fire so it will dry Having executed her mothers command she returned and commenced looking at him mercifully as if she wanted to help him by pouring into his heart all the warmth of her soul Rachel brought two loaves of bread with some preserves and dry fruits she sat by him and began to feed him small morsels as a mother feeds her little child At this time he felt stronger and sat up on the hearth mat while the red flames of fire reflected upon his sad face His eyes brightened and he shook his head slowly saying Mercy and cruelty are both wrestling in the human heart like the mad elements in the sky of this terrible night but mercy shall overcome cruelty because it is divine and the terror alone of this night shall pass away when daylight comes Silence prevailed for a minute and then he added with a whispering voice A human hand drove me into desperation and a human hand rescued me how severe man is and how merciful man is And Rachel inquired How ventured you brother to leave the convent on such a terrible night when even the beasts do not venture forth  The youth shut his eyes as if he wanted to restore his tears back into the depths of his heart whence they came and he said The animals have their caves and the birds of the sky their nests but the son of man has not place to resthis head Rachel retorted That is what Jesus said about himself And the young man resumed This is the answer for every man who wants to follow the Spirit and the Truth in this age of falsehood hypocrisy and corruption  After a few moments of contemplation Rachel said But there are many comfortable rooms in the convent and the coffers are full of gold and all kinds of provisions The sheds of the convent are stocked with fat calves and sheep what made you leave such haven in this deathly night The youth sighed deeply and said I left that place because I hated it And Rachel rejoined A monk in a    7192020 Spirits Rebellious by Khalil Gibran  newthoughtlibrarycomgibranKhalilspiritsRebellious 1011  convent is like a soldier in the battlefield who is required to obey the orders of his leader regardless of their nature I heard that a man could not become a monk unless he did away with his will his thoughts his desires and all that pertains to the mind But a good priest does not ask his monks to do unreasonable things How could the head priest of Deir Kizhaya ask you to give up your life to the storms and snow And he remarked In the opinion of the head priest a man cannot become a monk unless he is blind and ignorant senseless and dumb I left the convent because I ama sensible man who can see feel and hear  Miriam and Rachel stared at him as if they had found in his face a hidden secret after a moment ofmeditation the mother said Will a man who sees and hears go out on a night that blinds the eyes and deafens the ears And the youth sated quietly I was expelled from the convent Expelled exclaimed Rachel and Miriam repeated the same word in unison with her mother  He lifted his head regretting his words for he was afraid lest their love and sympathy be converted into hatred and disrespect but when he looked at them and found the rays of mercy still emanating from their eyes and their bodies vibrating with anxiety to learn further his voice choked and he continued Yes I was expelled form the convent because I could not dig my grave with my own hands and my heart grew weary of lying and pilfering I was expelled form the convent because my soul refused to enjoy the bounty of a people who surrendered themselves to ignorance I was driven away because I could not find rest in the comfortable rooms built with the money of the poor fellahin My stomach could not hold bread baked with the tears of the orphans My lips could not utter prayers sold for gold and food by the heads to the simple and faithful people I was expelled from the convent like a filthy leper because I was repeating to the monks the rules that qualified them to their present position  Silence prevailed while Rachel and Miriam were contemplating his words and gazing at him when they asked Are your father and mother living And he responded I have no father or mother now a place that is my home Rachel drew a deep sigh and Miriam turned her face toward the wall to hide hr merciful and loving tears  As a withering flower is brought back to life by dew drops that dawn pours into its begging petals so the youths anxious heart was enlivened by his benefactors affection and kindness He looked at them as a soldier looks upon his liberators who rescue him from the grip of the enemy and he resumed I lost my parents before I reached the age of seven The village priest took me to Deir Kizhaya and left me at the disposal of the monks who were happy to take me in and put me in charge of the cows and sheep which I led each day to the pasture When I attained the age of fifteen they put on me this black robe and led me into the altar whereupon the head priest addressed me saying Swear by the name of God and all saints and make a vow to live a virtuous life of poverty and obedience I repeated the words before I realized their significance or comprehended his own interpretation of poverty virtue and obedience  My name was Khalil and since that time the monks addressed me as Brother Mobarak but they never did treat me as a brother They ate the most palatable foods and drank the finest wine while I lived on dry vegetables and water mixed with tears They slumbered in soft beds while I slept on a stone slab in a dark and cold room by the shed Oftentimes I asked myself When will my heart stop craving for the food they eat and the wine they eat When will I cease to tremble with fear before my superiors But all my hopes were in vain for I was kept in the same state and in addition to caring for the cattle I was obliged to move heavy stones on my shoulders and to dig pits and ditches I sustained life on a few morsels of bread given to me in reward for my toil I knew of no other place to which I might go and the clergymen at the convent had caused me to abhor everything they were doing They had poisoned my mind until I commenced to think that the whole world was an ocean of sorrows and miseries and that the convent was the only port of salvation But when I discovered the source of their food and gold I was happy that I did not share it  Khalil straightened himself and looked about with wonder as if he had found something beautiful standing before him in that wretched hut Rachel and Miriam remained silent and he proceeded God who took my father and exiled me as an orphan to the convent did not want me to spend all my life walking blindly toward a dangerous jungle nor did He wish me to be a miserable slave for the rest of my life God opened my eyes and ears and showed me the bright light and made me hear Truth when Truth was talking  Rachel thought aloud Is there any light other than the sun that shines over all the people Are human beings capable of understanding the Truth Khalil returned The true light is that which emanates from within man and reveals the secrets of the heart to the soul making it happy and contented with life Truth is like the stars it does not appear except from behind obscurity of the night Truth is like all beautiful things in the world it does not disclose its desirability except to those who first feel the influence of falsehood Truth is a deep kindness that teaches us to be content in our everyday life and share with the people the same happiness  Rachel rejoined Many are those who live according to their goodness and many are those who believe that compassion to others is the shadow of the law of God to man but still they do not rejoice in life for they remain miserable until death Khalil replied Vain are the beliefs and teachings that make man miserable and false is the goodness that leads him into sorrow and despair for it is mans purpose to be happy on this earth and lead the way to felicity and preach its gospel wherever he goes He who does not see the kingdom of heaven in this life will never see it in the coming life We came not into this life by exile but we came as innocent creatures of God to learn how to worship the holy and eternal spirit and seek the hidden secrets within ourselves from the beauty of life This is the truth which I have learned from the teachings of the Nazarene This is the light that came from within me and showed me the dark corners of the convent that threatened my life This is the deep secret which the beautiful valleys and fields revealed to me when I was hungry sitting lonely and weeping under the shadow of the trees  Return to the Top

industrial nations and the standards of living in Third World countries such disparities have been common for thousands of years of recorded history These disparities have extended beyond wealth to the things that create wealth including the knowledge skills habits and discipline that have developed unequally in different geographic cultural and political settings  The ancient Greeks had geometry philosophy architecture and literature at a time when Britain was a land of illiterate tribal peoples living at a primitive level Athens had the Acropolis whose ruins are still impressive today thousands of years later at a time when there was not a single building in all of Britain The ancient Greeks had Plato Aristotle Euclid and other landmark figures who helped lay the intellectual foundations of Western civilization at a time when there was not a single Briton whose name had entered the pages of history   Scholars have estimated that there were parts of Europe in ancient times that were living at a level that Greece had transcended thousands of years earlier1 There were other complex civilizations in the ancient world not just in Greece but also in Egypt and China for example at a time when peoples in various parts of Europe and elsewhere were just beginning to learn the rudiments of agriculture2  Vast disparities in wealth and in wealthcreating capacity have been common for millennia But while large economic inequalities  1    have persisted throughout the recorded history of the human race the particular pattern of those inequalities has changed drastically over the centuries While Greeks were far more advanced than Britons in ancient times Britons were far more advanced than Greeks in the nineteenth century when Britain led the world into the industrial age   The Chinese were for centuries more advanced than any of the Europeans including among their discoveries and inventions the compass printing paper rudders and the porcelain plates that the West called chinaware or simply china Cast iron was produced in China a thousand years before it was produced in Europe3 A Chinese admiral made a voyage of discovery longer than Columbus voyage generations before Columbus voyage and in ships larger and more advanced than Columbus ships4 But the relative positions of China and Europe also reversed over the centuries Various other peoples living in various other parts of the world have had their own eras of leadership in particular fields or in advances across many specialties   Agriculture perhaps the most lifechanging advance in the evolution of human societies came to Europe from the Middle East in ancient times Agriculture made cities possible while hunter gatherers required far too much land to provide themselves with food for them to settle permanently in such compact and densely populated communities Moreover for centuries cities around the world have produced a wholly disproportionate share of all the advances in the arts sciences and technology compared to the achievements of a similar number of people scattered in the hinterlands5  Because Greeks were located nearer to the Middle East than the peoples of Northern Europe or Western Europe agriculture spread to the Greeks earlier and they could become urbanized earlier by centuries and advanced in many ways far beyond peoples elsewhere who had not yet received the many benefits made possible by urban living The accident of geographic location could not create genius but it made possible a setting in which many people could develop their own mental potential far beyond what was possible among  2 Wealth Poverty and Politics    bands of huntergatherers roaming over vast territory preoccupied with the pressing need to search for food  Geography is just one of the influences behind vast economic differences among peoples and places Moreover these differences are not simply differences in standards of living important as such differences are Different geographic settings also expand or restrict the development of peoples own mental potential into what economists call their human capital by presenting different peoples with access to a wider or narrower cultural universe These geographic settings differ not only horizontally as between Europe Asia and Africa for example but also vertically as between peoples of the plains versus peoples living up in the mountains As one geographic study put it  Mountain regions discourage the budding of genius because they are areas of isolation confinement remote from the great currents of men and ideas that move along the river valleys6  Many mountain regions around the world whether the Appalachian Mountains in the United States the Rif Mountains of Morocco the Pindus Mountains of Greece the Himalayas or other mountains elsewhere show very similar patterns of poverty and backwardness As distinguished French historian Fernand Braudel put it Mountain life persistently lagged behind the plain7 This was especially so during the millennia before the transportation and communications revolutions of the past two centuries which belatedly brought more of the progress of the outside world to isolated mountain villages What these technological revolutions could not bring to the mountains however were the previous centuries of cultural development that other people had in more favorable environments Peoples living in mountains could try to catch up but of course the rest of the world would not be standing still while they were doing so  Mountains are just one geographic feature and geography is just one influence on human development But whether considering  Issues 3    geography or culture isolation is a recurring factor in poverty and backwardness around the world whether that is physical isolation or cultural isolation for any number of particular reasons that will be explored in the chapters ahead  Whatever the reasons for economic disparities among peoples and nations such disparities have been as common in modern times as in ancient times In the twentyfirst century Switzerland Denmark and Germany have each had more than three times the per capita Gross Domestic Product GDP of Albania Serbia or Ukraine and Norway has had more than five times the per capita GDP of these latter countries8 Such economic disparities are not peculiar to Europe  In Asia as well Japan has more than three times the per capita GDP of China and more than nine times the per capita GDP of India9 Sub Saharan Africa has less than onetenth the per capita GDP of the countries of the Euro zone10  Within nations as well as between nations income disparities abound whether between classes races or other subdivisions of the human species Reactions to these economic disparities have ranged from resignation to revolution Because many people regard these disparities in their own country as strange if not sinister it is necessary to note that such disparities are not peculiar to any particular time or place Therefore explanations of economic differences cannot be confined to factors peculiar to a particular time or place such as modern capitalism or the industrial revolution much less to factors that are politically convenient or emotionally satisfying  Factors which raise morally momentous issues such as conquest and enslavement cannot automatically be assumed to be equally  4 Wealth Poverty and Politics   According to the authors of Why Nations Fail World inequality today exists because during the nineteenth and twentieth centuries some nations were able to take advantage of the Industrial Revolution and the technologies and methods of organization that it brought while others were unable to do so Daron Acemoglu and James A Robinson Why Nations Fail The Origins of Power Prosperity and Poverty New York Crown Business 2012 p 271 But economic inequalities among nations did not begin with the industrial revolution and the international inequalities of ancient times were by no means necessarily less than the inequalities of today     Issues 5  momentous as causal explanations of current economic disparities They may be or they may not in particular cases Peoples or nations may be rich or poor because 1 they produced more or produced less than others or 2 they seized more of what others had produced or had what they produced seized from them What anyone might prefer to believe at a given place or time has nothing to do with what the hard facts are  There is no question that the Spaniards conquests in the Western Hemisphere for example not only brutalized the conquered peoples and destroyed viable civilizations but also drained vast amounts of existing wealth in gold and silver from the Western Hemisphere to Spain 200 tons of gold and more than 18000 tons of silver11 the result of the looting of existing treasures from the indigenous peoples and the forced labor of that same population in gold and silver mines Nor was Spain unique in such behavior But the question here however is To what extent can transfers of wealth explain economic differences between peoples and nations in the world today   Spain is today one of the poorer countries in Western Europe surpassed economically by countries like Switzerland and Norway which have never had comparable empires The vast wealth that poured into Spain in its golden age could have been invested in its economy or in its people But it was not It was spent Spaniards themselves spoke of gold as pouring down on Spain like rain on a roof flowing on away immediately12 Nor has it been uncommon in history for a vast amount of human suffering whether by conquered or enslaved people to produce nothing more than a transient enrichment of a ruling elite  The monumental moral depredations of Spain in the Western Hemisphere had very little causal effect on the longrun prosperity of the Spanish economy As late as 1900 more than half the people in Spain were still illiterate13 while most blacks in the United States were literate despite having been free for less than 50 years14 A century later in the year 2000 the real per capita income in Spain was slightly lower than the real per capita income of black Americans15    Moral questions and causal questions are both important But confusing one with the other or imagining that they can simply be combined into one politically or ideologically attractive package is not a very promising approach to an explanation of economic differences  Economic disparities among nations are just part of the story of economic inequalities Large economic disparities within nations also need to be addressed When considering economic differences among the people of a given country there is a tendency to see these differences as issues about what is called income distribution16 But real income that is money income adjusted for inflation consists of the goods and services produced in the nation To look at this output solely from the viewpoint of those receiving money for having produced those goods and services risks needless misconceptions and serious social problems growing out of misconceptions   The standard of living of a nation depends more on its output per capita than on the money received as income for producing that output Otherwise government could make us all rich simply by printing more money By focusing on what is called income distribution many people proceed as if the government can rearrange these flows of money so as to have incomes become more fair however defined disregarding what the repercussions of such a policy might be on the more fundamental process of producing goods and services on which a countrys standard of living depends But in the vision presented in the media and often even in academia it is as if output or wealth just exist somehow and the really interesting question is how it is distributed   Sometimes this preoccupation with the receipt of incomes to the neglect of attention to the production of the output behind that receipt of incomes can lead to attempts to explain the receipt of very large incomes by greed as if an insatiable desire for vast amounts of money will somehow cause others to pay those vast amounts for the purchase of ones goods or services   6 Wealth Poverty and Politics    Issues 7  Among the many possible causes of differences in income and wealth whether among peoples regions or nations one of the most obvious is often ignored As economist Henry Hazlitt put it  The real problem of poverty is not a problem of distribution but of production The poor are poor not because something is being withheld from them but because for whatever reason they are not producing enough17  What seemed obvious to Henry Hazlitt was not obvious to many others who have had alternative visions with alternative agendas as corollaries of those visions The difference between seeing economic disparities as due to differences in the production of wealth and seeing those disparities as due to the transfer of wealth from some people to other people is fundamental   History shows that either cause of economic disparities can prevail at particular times and places The approach here will be to seek explanations of disparities in the production of wealth though the transfer of wealth whether through conquest or enslavement in the past or through the welfare state domestically or foreign aid internationally today will also be dealt with    When exploring the influences of geographic cultural and other factors affecting the production of wealth a sharp distinction must be made between influence and determinism At one time some people based their explanations of economic disparities among peoples and nations on geographic determinism Places with rich natural resources for example were supposed to be more prosperous than places lacking such resources It was easy enough for critics to show that this was by no means always the case nor necessarily true in most cases since there are povertystricken countries like Venezuela and Nigeria with rich natural resources and prosperous countries like Japan and Switzerland with very few natural resources Such results have led to a dismissal not only of geographic determinism but also of geography as a major influence in other senses    8 Wealth Poverty and Politics    The Gulf Stream originating in the subtropical waters of the Gulf of Mexico flows northeastward through the Atlantic Ocean past the British Isles creating milder winters in Western Europe than at the same latitudes in Eastern Europe Asia or North America  Geography however influences economic outcomes in other very different ways Moreover this influence is not necessarily due to particular geographic features considered in isolation but is often due to interactions among particular geographic features with other geographic features as well as interactions with other nongeographic factors such as cultural demographic political or other influences   Even such a simple and undisputed geographic fact as places located nearer the poles having lower temperatures on average than places located nearer the equator does not always hold up when interactions with other geographic factors are taken into account Thus London which is hundreds of miles farther north than Boston has average winter temperatures warmer than those in Boston and very similar to winter temperatures in American cities hundreds of miles south of Boston18 The average December daily high temperature in London is the same as the average December daily high temperature in Washington DC which is more than 850 miles farther south than London The average daily low temperature in Washington is slightly lower than in London for every month from December through March19 Latitude matters but so too does the varying warmth of different ocean currents and the interaction of the two can create very different outcomes from what either would produce by itself     When particular geographic factors interact with other  nongeographic factors as well the outcomes can likewise be very different from what they would be if considering particular geographic cultural demographic or political factors in isolation That is why influence is not the same as determinism Since many if not most economic outcomes depend on more than one factor the likelihood of all the various factors coming together in such a way as to produce equal levels of prosperity and progress among peoples and    nations around the world seems very remote Radically different geographic settings are just one of the factors making equal economic outcomes unlikely  Cultures are another factor that differs greatly among peoples and nations as well as among individuals and groups within a given nation Like critics of geographic influences critics of cultural influences have likewise sometimes resorted to an oversimplified picture of these influences For example an attempt to discredit the influence of cultural factors in economic outcomes by a wellknown study Why Nations Fail rejected the idea that the culture inherited from England explained why former colonies of England like the United States Canada and Australia were prosperous  Canada and the United States were English colonies but so were Sierra Leone and Nigeria The variation in prosperity within former English colonies is as great as that in the entire world The English legacy is not the reason for the success of North America20  While it is true that all these countries are former colonies of England and thus might be described as having been influenced by the culture of England it is also true that the people who founded Canada and the United States were Englishmen descendants of people steeped in the culture of England as it unfolded over the centuries while people in Sierra Leone and Nigeria were descendants of people steeped in the very different cultures of a region of subSaharan Africa for many centuries and exposed to the culture of England for less than one century during which their own indigenous cultures were by no means extinguished during the historically brief period when they were part of the British Empire  Many former English colonies populated by nonEnglish peoples continued to observe some aspect of the culture of England after becoming independent lawyers wearing wigs in court for example but these outward observances of English traditions did not prevent these former colonies from having a fundamentally very  Issues 9    different cultural legacy from that of England and a very different economic and political experience going forward after independence  Believers in genetic determinism likewise seek to discredit cultural factors which compete with their view that it is innate differences in intelligence among individuals and groups which explain differences in economic disparities among races nations and civilizations But genetic determinism based on undeniable contemporary differences in various kinds of achievements and mental test scores21 cannot explain equally undeniable radical changes in which particular races nations or civilizations have been far ahead and which have been far behind in different periods of history the British and the Greeks being just one example of role reversals out of many    Nations which went from being poor and backward to reaching the front ranks of human achievement in a century Scotland beginning in the eighteenth century and Japan beginning in the nineteenth century for example have changed faster than genetic makeup seems likely to change and in fact with no indication of any genetic changes at all though there are many indications of cultural changes in both these cases Researchers may be frustrated by the fact that the origins of particular cultures may be lost in the mists of time though their contemporary manifestations are visible Culture also does not readily lend itself to quantification as a contemporary genetic determinist has pointed out22 or to statistical analysis that can show such things as correlations between IQ and Gross Domestic Product lending an air of scientific precision But as statisticians have often pointed out correlation is not causation And as was said long ago It is better to be roughly right than precisely wrong23  Whether considering cultural geographic political or other factors interactions of these factors are part of the reason why understanding influences is very different from claiming determinism  10 Wealth Poverty and Politics    Chapter 2  GEOGRAPHIC   FACTORS  The world has never been a level playing field and everything costs  David S Landes1  It is obvious that peoples around the world have lived and developedover the millennia in different geographic settings What is not so obvious is how much those settings have differed from one another and the economic and social consequences of those differences Geography is not egalitarian   Geographic features are not even approximately equal in different regions of the world The disparities in geographic settings and in the phenomena which arise from those settings are at least as great as the income disparities that many people find so surprising For example far more tornadoes occur in the middle of the United States than in any other country or in all of the other countries of the world combined2 Most of the geysers in the world are in Yellowstone National Park3 Earthquakes are as common around the rim of the Pacific in both Asia and the Western Hemisphere as they are rare around the rim of the Atlantic4  These natural phenomena are simply illustrations of disparities in the physical effects of great variations in geographic conditions But there are also major economic and social effects of other disparities in geographically based phenomena The very land that people stand on is not the same in different places Highly fertile soils that scientists  11    call mollisols are neither evenly nor randomly distributed around the world Such soils are found almost exclusively in the temperate zones of the Northern and Southern Hemispheres and are scattered very unevenly there but are virtually nonexistent in the tropics5  This was especially important during the ages when agriculture was the most prevalent and most important of human economic activities which is to say for thousands of years except for some more fortunate regions within the most recent centuries The economies and cultures that evolved during those millennia did so within very different economic limits in different geographic settings  The economic effects of geographic differences are both direct affecting standards of living and indirect affecting the development of peoples themselves depending on whether a given geographic setting facilitates or impedes their communication and interactions with the rest of the human race No society has had a monopoly on the discoveries and inventions that have advanced human beings so for a given set of people whether a class a race or a nation to be in touch with what other peoples around the world are doing has been a major advantage   A larger cultural universe is important not simply because of the products technologies and knowledge that are transferred important as these are but also and perhaps equally or more important because people seeing repeatedly how things have been done differently by others in different places can break through the normal human inertia that keeps people doing the same things in the same familiar ways for generations or even centuries as happens in many geographically isolated societies It has been said that intellectual force is something that feeds upon the nutritious food of wide comparisons6  Conversely isolation tends to have the opposite effect When the Spaniards discovered the isolated Canary Islands in the fifteenth century they found the people there living much as people had lived in the stone age7 Similarly when the British discovered the isolated Australian aborigines in the eighteenth century8 In other isolated  12 Wealth Poverty and Politics    settings as well whether in distant mountain villages or deep in tropical jungles peoples have been found living as others had lived in earlier centuries or millennia9   Deserts are another geographic factor isolating peoples The largest of the worlds deserts by far is the Sahara Desert which is a negative factor for the peoples of North Africa but a devastating handicap for the peoples to the south black Africans in tropical sub Saharan Africa This incomparably vast desert slightly larger than the 48 contiguous states of the United States10 has been for centuries the largest single factor isolating the peoples of subSaharan Africa from the rest of the world The dearth of good harbors in tropical Africa also limited contacts with overseas cultures As Fernand Braudel put it external influence filtered only very slowly drop by drop into the vast African continent South of the Sahara11  Despite geographic influences there can be no geographic determinism because where peoples are in touch with other peoples even an unchanging geographic setting interacts with changing human knowledge and differing human cultures that have different values and aspirations producing very different outcomes at different times and places Most of what are natural resources for us today were not natural resources for the cave man who had not yet acquired the knowledge of how these things could be used for his own purposes There have been vast deposits of petroleum in the Middle East from time immemorial But it was only after science and technology had advanced to a level that created industrial nations elsewhere that the Middle Easts oil became a valuable asset profoundly changing life in both the Middle East and in the industrial countries   Individual geographic influences cannot be considered in isolation since their interactions crucially affect outcomes The relationship between rainfall and soil is just one example of these interactions Not only does rainfall vary greatly from one place to another so does the ability of the soil to hold the water that rains down on it This crucial ability to hold water is much less in the limestone soils of the Balkans than in the loess soils of northern China Since climate and soil affect  Geographic Factors 13    how well different crops can be grown in different places that has virtually precluded equal prosperity in all regions of the world during the millennia when agriculture was the most important economic activity around the world and the basis for the urban development of different societies and peoples   As with many other things the ability of land to hold water is a benefit only within some given range of variation Back in Roman times the very flat lands of northwestern Europe located in an area of plentiful rainfall resulted in many swamps and swampy places which were major impediments to agriculture Only after centuries of development and application of drainage techniques did much of this land become fertile12 Fertility is not always something inherent and immutable The development of drainage and irrigation techniques or of plows that can be harnessed to horses or oxen to plow heavy soils greatly affects their fertility It was the interaction of the soil rainfall and changing human knowledge and technology over time that made the lands of northwestern Europe become very fertile  What this means more generally is that the possible combinations and permutations of geographic factors greatly exceed the number of factors considered separately especially when combined with changing human knowledge over time Therefore the large number of possible economic and other outcomes in differing geographic settings makes equal outcomes for different regions and peoples around the world even less likely than a separate enumeration of geographic differences might suggest There has been nothing resembling equal opportunities to become equally productive among the tribal racial or national groups that developed for thousands of years in different parts of the world and evolved their respective cultures in different geographic settings   Not only have equal economic outcomes been rare to nonexistent the particular patterns of inequality in one era have differed greatly from the particular patterns of inequality in another era  The vast superiority of ancient Greek society to that in ancient Britain reflected Greeces geographic advantage in being located near  14 Wealth Poverty and Politics    Geographic Factors 15  the Middle East where agriculture developed and spread into nearby southeastern Europe centuries before it spread to all of Europe and beyond Without agriculture it is difficult if not virtually impossible to have densely populated urban societies as distinguished from societies of wandering hunters and gatherers or herders all of whom require vast amounts of land on which to roam in order to get enough food to sustain a given number of people   To the present day cities have remained the sources of much if not most of the advancements in civilization Far more of these advances and especially of landmark scientific and technological achievements have occurred among the populations of cities than among a similar number of people living in other settings13 Peoples without the geographic prerequisites for cities have long lagged behind peoples in settings that facilitated urbanization Cities developed relatively late in the existence of the human species and so did most of the advances in what we today recognize as civilization By making cities possible agriculture made possible the great industrial medical and other advances that flourished in urban environments   Modern advances in transportation and communication can break through the isolation of many peoples just as other technological advances can mitigate or sometimes even eliminate the handicaps of various other kinds of geographic impediments to economic and social development But what these historically recent advances cannot do is retroactively erase the effects of thousands of years of different cultural development that took place where there were serious geographic restrictions as compared to places inhabited by peoples with millennia of experiences enriched by wider exposures to the achievements and ideas of other peoples around the world  How we define the concept of environment is crucial One distinguished geographers definition was Environment is the total physical setting amid which people live14 But another geographer said environment means something more than local geographic conditions and called for a larger conception of environment15 pointing out how the past experiences of forebears have left their    mark on the present race in the form of inherited aptitudes and traditional customs acquired in those remote ancestral habitats16 Whether an environment is described geographically or socioeconomically the most fundamental distinction is between defining environment as what is around a given people and defining environment to include also what is within those people  We cannot understand what is happening today without understanding past conditions that shaped both the physical and mental worlds of people living today which are a legacy of the past for better or worse As one cultural historian put it men are not blank tablets upon which the environment inscribes a culture which can readily be erased to make way for a new inscription17 As another noted historian put it We do not live in the past but the past in us18  Against this general background we can now examine in more detail the influences of such geographic factors as waterways mountains and flora and fauna Geographic location as such is also a factor whose influence is worth noting quite aside from the particular geographic features of a particular location  WATERWAYS  Waterways play many vital roles as drinking water for humans and animals as sources of food such as fish and other aquatic creatures as sources of irrigation for crops and as arteries of transportation for cargo and people In all these roles waterways differ from one another in ways that can make them more valuable or less valuable to humans   Waterways obviously differ in kind from rivers to lakes harbors and seas and each kind in turn has its own internal differences in navigability for example Rivers flowing gently across wide level plains as in Western Europe are far more usable for both commerce and the transportation of people than rivers plunging down from great heights through rapids cascades and waterfalls as in most of  16 Wealth Poverty and Politics    Geographic Factors 17  subSaharan Africa Indeed the same stream of water can differ at different places along its route to the sea  A torrent that issues from its source in the mountains is not the river which reaches the sea On its long journey from highland to lowland it receives now the milky waters of a glacierfed stream now a muddy tributary from agricultural lands now the clear waters from a limestone plateau while all the time its racing current bears a burden of soil torn from its own banks19  Although the most indispensable role of waterways has been to provide drinking water for humans and animals without which they cannot survive one of the most important roles of waterways for economic development has been their role as transportation arteries The crucial fact about the role of waterways as transportation arteries for cargo and people is the vast difference in cost between land transport and water transport which was even greater in the millennia before the advent of motorized land transport less than two centuries ago   In 1830 for example it cost more than 30 dollars to move a ton of cargo 300 miles on land but only 10 dollars to ship it 3000 miles across the Atlantic Ocean20 One consequence of such transportation cost differentials was that people living in the city of Tiflis in the Caucasus 341 miles from the Baku oil fields by land bought oil imported from America 8000 miles away by water21 Similarly in midnineteenth century America before the transcontinental railroad was built San Francisco could be reached both faster and cheaper across the Pacific Ocean from a port in China than it could be reached over land from the banks of the Missouri River22  Given the vast amounts of food fuel and other necessities of life that must be transported into cities and the vast amounts of a citys output that must be transported out to sell there is no mystery why so many cities around the world have been located on navigable waterways especially before the transportation revolutions within the past 200 years that produced motorized transport on land   Even in the twentieth century the differential cost of land transport and water transport did not disappear In twentieth century    Africa the estimated cost of shipping an automobile by land from Djibouti to Addis Ababa 342 miles was the same as the cost of shipping it by water from Detroit to Djibouti 7386 miles23  Looked at differently where there has been a lack of navigable waterways accessibility to the outside world has often been severely limited shrinking the cultural universe drastically and with it shrinking the opportunities of peoples to connect with other peoples and cultures far away In some cases a dearth of waterways and the presence of geographic barriers meant that people living only 10 or 20 miles from each other often had very little contact This was especially so in places lacking horses camels or other beasts of burden during the many centuries before modern transportation and communications developed   One of the remarkable facts about the continent of Africa is that although Africa is more than twice the size of Europe the African coastline is shorter than the European coastline24 This is possible only because the European coastline twists and turns creating many harbors where ships can dock sheltered from the rough waters of the open seas Moreover the coastline of Europe is increased by the many islands and peninsulas that make up more than onethird of that continents total land area   By contrast the African coastline is smooth with few substantial indentations few good natural harbors and fewer islands and peninsulas which make up only 2 percent of Africas land area Moreover coastal waters around subSaharan Africa are often too shallow for oceangoing ships to dock25 In such places large ocean going ships must anchor offshore and have their cargoes unloaded onto smaller vessels that can operate in shallow waters But this time consuming process and the greater amount of labor and equipment required is more costly often prohibitively costly For centuries seaborne commerce between Europe and Asia sailed around Africa and seldom stopped  Even in those few places where large ships can enter Africa on deep rivers tropical Africas coasts have narrow coastal plains that often end abruptly against escarpments26 One important  18 Wealth Poverty and Politics    consequence of this shape of the land is that even in places where ships can enter the continent on African rivers they can seldom get very far inland before being confronted with cascades and waterfalls For the same reason boats coming from the vast interior of the continent are seldom able to continue out to the open sea as boats and even large ships can do in various places on the Eurasian landmass or in parts of the Western Hemisphere  By contrast with Africa China has had a huge network of navigable waterways described as unique in the world formed by the Yangtze River and its tributaries as well as an indented coastline full of harbors27 What was also unique were the centuries during which China was the most advanced nation in the world on into what were called the Middle Ages in Europe   It was not just in harbors but also in rivers that Chinas waterways have contrasted with those in Africa Africa is a dry continent with many of its rivers not deep enough to carry the large ships with heavy loads that are carried on the rivers of China Western Europe or the United States Even the Nile was unable to carry the largest ships in the days of the Roman Empire28 much less the even larger ships of today   The average depth of a river is not as important as its minimum depth on the route of a given vessels journey which is what determines how far a boat or ship of a given size and weight can go The same word navigable may be applied to many very different waterways but with very different meanings in specific concrete circumstances Although the St Lawrence Seaway is navigable by oceangoing ships all the way into the Great Lakes that does not mean that it is navigable by all oceangoing ships When major manmade improvements were made to the Seaway in 1959 and for many years thereafter it was navigable by most of the ocean going ships in the world but as such ships grew larger and larger over the years today it is no longer navigable by most oceangoing ships though it is still navigable by many29  The Zambezi River in Africa has highly variable depths from place to place and from rainy season to dry season In some times and places  Geographic Factors 19    the Zambezi is barely navigable by boats requiring just 3 feet of water though at other times and places the water level is 20 feet deeper30 Some rivers in Angola can support boats requiring no more than 8 feet of water31 During the dry season even a major West African river like the Niger can carry barges weighing no more than 12 tons32 But in China ships weighing 10000 tons have been able to go hundreds of miles up the Yangtze River and smaller vessels another thousand miles beyond that33  Rivers in tropical Africa are seldom continuously navigable for any such distances even when these rivers have ample water In terms of the contours of the land subSaharan Africa has been characterized as cursed with a mesa form which converts nearly every river into a plunging torrent on its approach to the sea34  Most of tropical Africa is more than 1000 feet above sea level and much of it is more than 2000 feet above sea level Thus the Zaire River begins at an altitude of 4700 feet and so must come down that vertical distance before flowing out into the Atlantic Ocean creating rapids cascades and waterfalls on the way Although the Zaire has more water than the Mississippi the Yangtze or the Rhine that does not make it the equivalent of these and other major commercial waterways elsewhere because the Zaires many plunges interrupt its navigability though it may carry extensive inland traffic for various distances on level stretches This pattern is common among the rivers of subSaharan Africa   Another pattern that is common in tropical Africa is a wide fluctuation in the water level of its rivers due to highly varying rainfall amounts in different seasons Unlike Western Europe where the rain falls more or less evenly throughout the year35 rainfall patterns in subSaharan Africa include long periods when there is no rain at all followed by torrential downpours during rainy seasons36 Because of such seasonal rainfall patterns the Niger Rivers chief tributary the Benue River has in places been navigable only two months of the year This has led to a hectic shipping pattern  20 Wealth Poverty and Politics    Geographic Factors 21  If they let the craft stay up the Benue a day too long the vessels will be stuck on sandbanks for ten months Yet if through caution or misinformation they withdraw the fleet too soon much valuable merchandise is left behind and can only be evacuated by land at much greater cost   The first boats to go in are the commercial canoes then follow the larger craft and finally when there is sufficient water at Lokoja the largest powercraft and their barges sail up the river as fast as possible Towards the end of the short season the large craft have to come out first because of the fall in the level of the water the medium sized craft follow and the small canoes may continue for some time evacuating small quantities of produce37  Statistics on how many miles of navigable rivers there are in Africa can be very misleading when these are not continuous miles that a vessel of a given size and weight can travel before encountering water too shallow to support it or encountering cascades or waterfalls that stop all vessels Sometimes a canoe can go ashore and be emptied of its cargo before reaching a waterfall with both the canoe and the cargo then being carried around the waterfall so that the reloaded canoe can proceed on another level stretch of water However this is both a timeconsuming and therefore expensive process and one that limits the size of both the canoe and its cargo The net result is that only a cargo that is very valuable in proportion to its size and weight is economically feasible to transport in such places  By contrast in other parts of the world where rivers are continuously navigable for hundreds of miles across level plains as in various places on the Eurasian landmass or in the Western Hemisphere bulky cargoes with relatively low value in proportion to their size and weight wood coal or wheat for example may be economically viable to transport long distances by water  Even within the same continent Western Europes rivers have been very different from the rivers in Eastern Europe or Southern Europe as well as radically different from the rivers of subSaharan Africa A broad coastal plain where the land nowhere reaches 1000 feet above sea level means that Western Europe has had slowflowing rivers which were especially valuable in the long ages before power boats could readily go against the flow of swiftmoving currents In    many places during that era logs for example could be floated down a river even when the only way for people in charge of those logs to return home was by land  Western Europes rivers often lead out into the open seas providing access to seaports around the world But most rivers in Eastern Europe and Southern Europe are quite different in ways that affect both economic activity and the size of the cultural universe available to the peoples living in the regions through which these rivers flow Because the warming effect of the Gulf Stream on the climate of Western Europe is lessened the farther east one goes the waterways of Eastern Europe are frozen more often and longer in the winters   Even when the rivers of Eastern Europe are flowing often they are flowing into lakes or inland seas rather than out into the open seas that connect with the rest of the world The waters of the Danube the Don and the Dnieper flow into the Black Sea for example and the waters of the Volga flow into the Caspian Sea But most of the water in Russian rivers flows into the Arctic Ocean which is hardly as accessible to the rest of the world as are the Atlantic or the Pacific These differences in waterways are among the many reasons why Eastern Europe has lagged economically behind Western Europe for centuries   The rivers of Southern Europe have contributed even less to the economic development of that region partly because there are fewer major rivers than in Western Europe or Eastern Europe and partly because the climate in the lands of Mediterranean Europe is one with torrential downpours in winter and very little rain in the summer when rivers almost dry up In the mountainous Balkans rivers often flow too steeply to be navigable except for some that are locally navigable by small boats and rafts38  In the Western Hemisphere the United States has had huge geographic advantages in its waterways as in other ways a well  22 Wealth Poverty and Politics    In the United States as well the steamboat changed the Mississippi from a one way artery of traffic to one in which after 1815 a steamboat could go back up the river from New Orleans to Louisville Rupert B Vance Human Geography of the South p 264    indented coastline punctuated by superb harbors in the words of distinguished economic historian David S Landes39 and large rivers of which the Mississippi is the most impressive In contrast to the plunging waters of many African rivers more than thirty cataracts falling a total of nearly a thousand feet in a distance of 150 miles on the Zaire River40 the riverbed of the Mississippi slopes downward at a rate of 4 inches per mile41 Although the Nile is the longest river in the world the Mississippi pours many times as much water into the Gulf of Mexico as the Nile pours into the Mediterranean42 Water is what rivers are all about and the Mississippi has far more of it than the Nile even though the smaller amount of water in the Nile is stretched out over a longer distance  In contrast to the limited ability of the Nile to carry large ships the Hudson River and the harbors at San Francisco and San Diego are all deep enough for aircraft carriers to dock right up against the land The Great Lakes are a vast system of connected waterways of which Lake Michigan alone is larger than the nation of Israel and Lake Superior is larger than Lake Michigan These lakes are also deep enough to handle many oceangoing ships as they have since 1959 when manmade improvements to the St Lawrence River allowed such ships to extend their journeys from the Atlantic Ocean all the way to Chicago and other midwestern cities on the Great Lakes  As a noted geographer put it  No other equally large area of the earth is so generously equipped by nature for the production and distribution of the articles of commerce as southern Canada and that part of the United States lying east of the Rocky Mountains The simple build of the North American continent consisting of a broad central trough between distant mountain ranges and characterized by gentle slopes to the Atlantic Ocean and the Gulf of Mexico has generated great and small rivers with easygoing currents that everywhere opened up the land to explorer trader and settler43  Waterways differ not only physically from place to place but also in their human significance from one time period to another The Mediterranean Sea for example was for centuries a more inviting  Geographic Factors 23    24 Wealth Poverty and Politics  waterway than the Atlantic Ocean before there were later advances in knowledge because of the ease of navigating around the Mediterranean  The long summer of cloudless days and starry nights of steady winds and fogless atmosphere provided a favorable season for sailing when the strong diurnal breezes favored the outgoing and homecoming ships and the countless promontories and mountainous islands visible in the lucid air furnished points to steer by before the invention of the compass44  Oceans changed from being transportation barriers to being transportation avenues only after humans learned how to navigate where there were no landmarks to follow but simply water to be seen in all directions all the way out to the horizon Navigation on the oceans became possible only after science mathematics and technology had developed sufficiently to overcome this fundamental handicap first through various ways of using the position of the sun in the sky during the day and the positions of stars at night providing as it were landmarks in the sky by which to determine directions on the ocean and eventually and decisively developing the magnetic compass which could be used more readily and even when clouds obscured the sky  Seaports around the gentle waters of the Mediterranean were for centuries more busy than seaports on the more turbulent Atlantic coast of Europe before Europeans discovered the Western Hemisphere This changed the main direction of Europes international trade Because different kinds of ships were required to handle the very different rough waters of the Atlantic the leading commercial and naval powers of the Mediterranean were eclipsed by the leading commercial and naval powers of the Atlantic who had ships better adapted for the new transatlantic commerce The seas had not changed but their economic and other significance had with the advance of knowledge and technology  Despite the crucial importance of agriculture as a source of a dependable food supply for a concentrated and sedentary population fishing has been another source and one available in regions where agriculture has not been sufficiently productive to sustain human life by itself This has been especially important in very cold climates45    In other climates as well fishing can be a major economic activity It was said at one time that Amsterdam was built on herring46 and fishing has also been important to the economy of Japan among other places However agriculture may not be as productive in tropical lands where the fertility of the soil is often poor as in the Amazon jungles where there are many fishing villages  Fishing villages represent a step upward from a huntergathering society to a sedentary life even though these villages may not represent the same degree of population concentration as cities fed by agriculture However commercial fishing supplying a market reaching far beyond the local area can be a major contributor to the development of cities47 In some of the lands around the Mediterranean the soil yields so little in agriculture that many people have had to piece together a livelihood by combining the products of both the land and the sea as others in that region have by combining agriculture and herding animals48  Fishing opportunities however are no more evenly distributed around the world than other opportunities A long continental shelf reaching out into the Atlantic Ocean creates an underwater environment where fish and other marine life can flourish49 But the land is shaped differently around and under the Mediterranean Sea50 which lacks the shallow shelves of the Atlantic51  As a result while there has long been fishing in the Mediterranean it has not been comparable to the rich fishing regions that attract commercial fishing vessels great distances to the Atlantic waters near Newfoundland and Iceland or into the North Sea fishing grounds52 The net result in the early twentieth century was that an Italian fishermans earnings averaged about onefourth the earnings of a French fisherman and oneeighth those of an English fisherman Nor was this due to differences in the price of fish which was no higher in France or England than in Italy53  While waterways have played major roles in the economic and social development of many regions of the world these roles have often been due to interactions of waterways with other geographic and nongeographic factors rather than being based on the nature of the  Geographic Factors 25    26 Wealth Poverty and Politics  waterways alone South Americas Amazon River for example is by far the most physically impressive of the worlds rivers in terms of its volume of water the largest of any river in the world its navigability and its length which is nearly as long as that of the Nile while the Amazon empties dozens of times more water into the Atlantic than the Nile empties into the Mediterranean54 It also empties several times as much water as the Mississippi empties into the Gulf of Mexico    Nevertheless the region through which the Amazon flows with its jungles and poor quality soils has had no such economic development as would make the Amazon at all comparable as an artery of commerce to the Mississippi the Rhine the Danube or other rivers that put together do not have as much water as the Amazon Conversely a very modestsized river like the Thames less than 10 percent as long as the Amazon plays a major economic role as the shipping outlet for a land of thriving industry and commerce  In Russia the Yenisey and the Lena rivers each have more than twice as much water as the Volga but it is the Volga that carries more shipping tonnage than any other Russian river because it flows through regions containing most of the nations population and most of its industry and farmland   What these differences between waterways and within a given kind of waterway mean for their human consequences is that the possible combinations and permutations of the factors that make them useful to humans are so numerous as to make equal values of waterways to human beings located in different parts of the world very unlikely quite aside from the fact that waterways are more available in some regions of the world than in others and are virtually nonexistent

Margaret Sedeen p 299    Geographic Factors 27  LAND  AND  CLIMATE  Land has many aspects The simple fact of the shape of the land determines how water will flow and that in turn has major implications for the fate of people living in a given region The physical and chemical composition of the soil is crucial for agriculture as is climate Special features of the land such as mountains deserts and rift valleys can fragment a population and isolate the fragments from each other This has been the fate of much of the Balkans of subSaharan Africa and of mountain communities in many countries around the world   Mountains Mountains affect both the lives of people living in those mountains  and the lives of people living on the land below and it affects these two sets of people very differently  About 10 to 12 percent of the worlds population lives in mountains about half in Asia and about 90 percent live no higher in the mountains than 2500 meters or 8200 feet Population density in mountains is usually relatively low55 Certain common patterns have appeared in the lives of people living in various mountain communities around the world whether the Appalachian Mountains in the United States the Rif Mountains of Morocco the Pindus Mountains of Greece or the Himalayas in Asia The most common of these patterns have included poverty isolation and backwardness56 Nor is it hard to see why The very nature of mountains long denied the people living there many of the things that promote prosperity and connection with the general progress in the rest of the world  Fertile land can seldom be found on mountainsides where soil is readily washed away by rain though some of this soil collects down in mountain valleys while the rest of it is washed away down into the lowlands People tend to gather in the flat areas of land in the valleys amid the mountains since this is where crops can be grown most    readily But mountain valleys are often isolated from each other with the population being as scattered as the flat lands they occupy as was said of mountain communities in the Southern mountains in the United States57 though the same pattern has existed elsewhere around the world The amount of usable soil in each valley tends to limit the number of people who can be fed there so that small villages have often been the norm These villages may be isolated from each other as well as being isolated from the outside world even when these villages are not far from each other as the crow flies but are not very accessible to each other across rough mountain terrain58  These historic handicaps were especially severe during the millennia before modern transportation and communications technologies were created However these technological advances have almost invariably originated outside the mountains themselves and the extent to which they have been adopted has varied with local geographic and economic conditions Moreover even where these advances have been adopted extensively that cannot undo the effects of previous centuries of cultural isolation   Navigable waterways are often lacking in mountain terrain where the steepness of the land makes for rapids cascades and waterfalls so this means of transportation and communication has often been denied to people in many mountain communities such as in the Balkans59 Land transportation is also likely to be difficult especially where the rugged terrain is inhospitable to wheeled vehicles so that travel on foot is the only feasible way to get around in many places Distinguished historian Fernand Braudel pointed out that in 1881 the wheeled vehicle was still unknown in Morocco60 As another scholar said of people in the Rif Mountains of Morocco The Rifians are great walkers and they have to be61  Although such patterns may be general there are also exceptions Parts of the Himalayas and the Andes for example have fertile and wellwatered land62 The Alps have numerous mountain passes63 broad enough to accommodate much commercial traffic and in ancient times Hannibals army with its elephants  28 Wealth Poverty and Politics    Building roads not to mention water systems sewage systems or electric power systems can be extremely expensive where isolated and thinly populated mountain communities mean very high costs per capita for creating such infrastructure In Italy s Apennines Mountains as late as 1860 there were no roads whatever in 91 out of 123 Lucanian villages64 Even in the twentieth century there were places in the Pindus Mountains of Greece more accessible to mules and to people on foot than to wheeled vehicles and one village acquired electricity as late as 195665  As a study of mountains around the Mediterranean in the late twentieth century noted Only a few roads penetrate the Pindus today and most of those are of recent construction The great majority are unpaved66 Substandard infrastructure remains common in mountains around the world even in the twentyfirst century67 However modern transportation and communications technologies are making inroads into the isolation of many mountain communities68 though with great differences among different regions of the world Switzerland for example has more than 20 times as many miles of road per capita as in Ethiopia69  Distinguished American scholar Edward C Banfields classic account of an Italian mountain village where he lived in 1954 and 1955 The Moral Basis of a Backward Society noted that there was only one telephone in town In this community of 3400 people to which he gave the pseudonym Montegrano there were five automobiles for hire but no one owned a private car Most of the people were poor farmers and laborers Onethird of the men and twothirds of the women could neither read nor write and some peasants had never gone beyond the next village just four miles away70 When they traveled they seldom used a cart much less a car to transport the belongings they took with them As Professor Banfield noted  When the farm people of Montegrano travel it is on foot leading a donkey to the sides of which large baskets are fixed   The range of travel then is limited to nearby towns Many people have never travelled beyond these neighboring towns and some women have never left Montegrano71  Geographic Factors 29    30 Wealth Poverty and Politics  It was not only infrastructure and technological advances that reached mountain communities belatedly So did cultures prevailing on the plains below Although Islam has for centuries been the prevailing religion and culture of the Middle East and North Africa a different religion and culture continued to prevail in the neighboring mountainous regions of Armenia and Abyssinia And though people in the Rif Mountains of Morocco eventually adopted Islam this was centuries after the people on the land below had already become Muslims72  Language likewise moved slowly up from the lowlands to the highlands Gaelic continued to survive in the Scottish highlands long after the Scottish lowlanders were speaking English and the Vlach language survived in the Pindus Mountains of Greece centuries after people on the land below were speaking Greek73 Language differences have added to the sources of isolation in the mountains especially when the languages or dialects spoken in the mountains were unknown in most of the outside world Of the more than one thousand languages in New Guinea more than 70 percent originate in the mountainous regions which cover only onethird of the island74 A multiplicity of languages and dialects has been common in isolated mountain communities around the world75  Law and order are yet another part of the social infrastructure that has been harder to establish and maintain in many mountain regions Even mountains nominally under the control of a nation or empire have not always or in all places been effectively under such control Examples include the mountains of Montenegro under the Ottoman Empire the Rif Mountains under Moroccan sultans and the uplands of India under the Mughal rulers76 Both the Scottish highlands and the highlands of colonial Ceylon remained independent for many years after their respective nearby lowlands were conquered and incorporated into another cultural universe In centuries past it was common in many mountain regions around the world for the highland people to raid and plunder the more prosperous people in the lowlands77    Poverty in many mountain communities long exceeded anything known as poverty in most other settings As Professor Banfield said of the Italian mountain village in which he lived in 1954 and 1955  Most people in Montegrano are desperately poor Many have nothing to eat but bread and not enough of that Even the welltodo are poor by American standards Such a town cannot support a newspaper or the kinds of activity which a newspaper would report78  Such poverty in the mountains was not unique to this Italian village A twentieth century Oxford scholar in Greece said I have met a Greek brought up in this century in a mountain village who had never seen an olive or a fish or an orange until he was 12 years old79  In various mountains in countries around the Mediterranean it was long common in the past for peasants to rarely eat meat and even cheese was largely confined to a few fortunately situated villages80 Bread was the common food for peasants in all three meals of the day In earlier times women made clothes for their families and mountain people with animals brought those animals inside in cold weather As a landmark history of Western civilization put it Only the most prosperous had wooden dividers separating the human from animal quarters81 A traveler through the Bulgarian mountains in 1574 said that he preferred to sleep outdoors under a tree rather than in mountain peasants huts where animals and people lived together in such filth that we could not bear the stench82  These broad generalizations do not of course apply to every mountain community everywhere But the general pattern has been all too true in all too many mountains and highlands around the world especially in centuries past A twentieth century study of a village in the Himalayas found that 20 percent of newborn babies died before they were a year old83 Even in prosperous America in the early twentieth century a sample of farmers in North Carolina showed that those located in the coastal plains earned three to five times the income of farmers in mountain counties84  Geographic Factors 31    An Appalachian county in Kentucky was called a pauper county in the 1890s and was still in 2010 one of the poorest counties in the United States85 The life expectancy of a man in that county was less than the life expectancy of a man in Fairfax County Virginia by more than a decade Womens life expectancy in that same Kentucky county had actually declined slightly over a period of 20 years The population of this county incidentally was 985 percent white86  Even in the early twentyfirst century most of the mountain people in the world still practiced subsistence agriculture87 The negative economic consequences of mountain life have been accompanied by broader negative human consequences In many mountain communities around the world especially in times past the struggle for existence caused children to have to work at an early age curtailing their education88 and thus isolating them from even secondhand knowledge of the wider world beyond the mountains Illiteracy was common among people in mountain communities around the Mediterranean on into the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries89  Few people from the lands below moved up into the mountains to live especially in times past and those mountain people who moved down to the lower elevations encountered a different world one which they often found difficult to adjust to and a world in which they were often not accepted except perhaps as sojourners for seasonal work This pattern persisted for centuries In medieval times the Adriatic port of Dubrovnik traded and maintained good relations with the people of the hinterland the Vlach shepherds from the mountains but the latter were not allowed to winter on the territory of the Republic nor to remain within the city90 Such negative reactions to mountain people in the lowlands were not peculiar to medieval Europe Similar negative reactions to mountain peoples were common in nineteenth century France and Morocco and in modern Nepal India and Thailand91  There was much the same resistant attitude toward mountain folk in twentieth century America as shown by press reactions when large numbers of mountain people moved into urban communities  32 Wealth Poverty and Politics    exemplified by the reactions of the Chicago Tribune as noted in a scholarly study of migrations from the mountains  The hillbillies were described as a degenerate population with the lowest standard of living and moral code if any   and the most savage tactics when drunk which is most of the time National publicity followed with stories in Time Look and Harpers the latter under the headline The Hillbillies Invade Chicago That articles subhead gave away the racial slippage The citys toughest integration problem has nothing to do with Negroes    It involves a small army of white Protestant Early American migrants from the South who are usually proud poor primitive and fast with a knife The message was clear and intentional these people are worse than the colored92  The parallels with blacks go beyond the opinions of others A 1932 study of white children from small communities in the Blue Ridge Mountains found that these white children not only had IQ scores somewhat lower than the national average of 85 for black children but also had IQ patterns similar to those of black children such as doing their worst on abstract questions and having IQs closer to the US national average of 100 in their early years with a widening gap as they grew older93  Another study of mountain children in East Tennessee schools in 1930 found similar patterns These children had a median IQ of 82 on one test and 78 on another On the test where they did better their median IQ was 95 at age six and declined to 74 by age sixteen A decade later after social economic and educational improvements in these East Tennessee communities the median IQ in the same schools rose to 87694  Among those young people from the mountains in the early twentieth century who sought higher education at Berea College in Kentucky only half returned to their home communities usually those who failed to graduate95 The tendency of more able or ambitious young people to move down from the mountains while the less able or less ambitious remained or moved farther up into the mountains was expressed by a local paradoxical saying that cream sinks and the skim milk rises in the mountains96 In Spain there was  Geographic Factors 33    a similar Catalan saying always go down never go up97 This pattern of an outmigration of young people from mountain communities has been a common pattern whether in the United States or in India or other places around the world98  There have also long been seasonal migrants from the mountains whether the mountainous regions of Spain Nepal South America or South Africa99 Remittances from both seasonal and longer term migrants have played a significant role in supporting families remaining behind in the mountains100 Longer lasting migrations have included many mountain men who became mercenaries in various armies101 the Swiss and Scottish highlanders in Europe and the Gurkhas and Montagnards in Asia for example Rifs from North Africa were part of General Francisco Francos army that won the Spanish civil war and made Spain a fascist country in the 1930s Over the centuries it has been estimated that perhaps as many as a million Swiss soldiers died fighting in other countries wars102  Despite the largely negative influence of mountains on those who live in them mountains are often a boon to those on the lands below As moistureladen winds collide with mountain slopes these winds are forced upward where the colder air reduces their moisturecarrying capacity leading to rain and snow It is not uncommon for rainfall on the windward side of a mountain range to be several times as much as the rainfall on the other side in what is called the rain shadow of the mountains As rain water flows down the mountainsides creating trickles of water that join together to form streams these streams in turn join together to create rivers Thus water collected from a wide area of mountain territory is concentrated and delivered as rivers with many uses to people on the land below All the major rivers of the world have their beginnings in mountains103  Where precipitation in the mountains takes the form of snow the water is not released all at once but much of it is released later and gradually when this snow melts during warmer weather This means that rivers are not solely dependent on the immediate rainfall to keep  34 Wealth Poverty and Politics    Geographic Factors 35  flowing because melting snow from the mountains provides water to sustain the rivers during dry periods   As with many other things we can see its importance by seeing what happens in its absence Although tropical Africa has Mount Kilimanjaro it has no major mountain ranges comparable to those found in Asia Europe or the Western Hemisphere Therefore during the dry season in subSaharan Africa rivers and streams shrink drastically in the absence of melting snows in the mountains to keep these waterways supplied with water  Meanwhile the Sierra Nevada Mountains in Spain and the Taurus Mountains in Turkey both supply the water that makes a flourishing irrigated agriculture possible in the lowlands104 where rainfall alone would not be sufficient during the Mediterranean summer when the sun evaporates more water than falls as rain in that region of the world105  Soil and Climate It is hard to think of any innovation in the long history of the  human race that has had a greater impact than agriculture It was some time within roughly the last 5 percent of the existence of human beings that people moved beyond gathering their food from the spontaneous produce of nature or fishing or herding domesticated animals and began instead to plant the foods they wanted Virtually everything that we today recognize as civilization dates from the beginning of agriculture and with it the beginning of cities  Exactly how agriculture itself arose is one of those questions whose answer is lost in the mists of ancient times But how agriculture came to the Western world is known It came from the Middle East thousands of years ago and apparently originated somewhere between the Tigris and Euphrates rivers in what is today Iraq This was a geographic setting in which agriculture could not only exist but thrive at the existing level of knowledge at that time     The first farmers are unlikely to have known from the outset that crops use up nutrients in the soil which have to be replenished if the soil is to continue to yield crops of the same magnitude But in the land between the Tigris and Euphrates rivers farmers did not have to know that Annual floods washed new nutrients over the lands as annual floods would also do on the lands along the Nile where another great ancient civilization arose in Egypt   In Asia agriculture began on the Indian subcontinent in the valley of the Indus river in what is today Pakistan Despite the arid climate melting snows from the vast Himalayan mountain range provided the annual flooding which fertilized the land for agriculture Here too some of the earliest cities were built and some of the earliest civilizations developed It was much the same story as regards the beginning of agriculture and civilization in China  Agriculture seems to have started in North China in the region of the great bend of the Yellow River   In fact this center of early Chinese civilization resembled in some ways the homes of other ancient civilizations the flood plains of the Nile in Egypt the Tigris and Euphrates in Mesopotamia and the Indus in modern Pakistan106  Elsewhere the earliest farmers had to move on after farming a given land a number of years and seeing the successive annual crops grow successively smaller as the nutrients in the soil were used up threatening the food supply on which human survival depended Some peoples simply waited for nature to restore the fertility of the soil after they left for other lands to farm while some other peoples burned the vegetation before moving on thereby providing the new nutrients that would gradually restore fertility as these nutrients were absorbed into the soil But between the Tigris and Euphrates rivers and along the Nile annual floods could keep the land fertile long before human beings figured out what was happening But most other places in the world did not have this windfall gain  Here again we see a profound geographic inequality affecting the fates of different peoples very differently That inequality of fertility in the land has continued on to the present day As already noted the  36 Wealth Poverty and Politics    most fertile soils are neither evenly nor randomly distributed around the world A huge swath of these unusually fertile soils spreads across the vast Eurasian landmass beginning in Eastern Europe and extending into northeastern China   In the Western Hemisphere there is a large concentration of these rich soils in the American upper midwestern and plains states extending into parts of Canada In the temperate zone of South America there is another concentration of such soils across Uruguay and in the southern part of Argentina107 But the natural processes by which such soils are generated or sustained seem not to be found in the tropics where soil fertility is seldom comparable   The crop yields per acre in tropical Africa are a fraction of the crop yields in China or the United States108 Among the many deficiencies of the soil in subSaharan Africa is that the topsoil is often shallow allowing little space for plant roots to reach deep into the ground for nutrients and water109 Moreover the dryness of much of Africa inhibits the use of fertilizers to supply the nutrients missing in the soil Fertilizers used without adequate water can inhibit rather than enhance the growth of crops   Even in places where there are wetlands in central Africa these wetlands have not been as often cultivated as wetlands in temperate climates because dangerous tropical diseases like malaria and river blindness flourish in tropical Africas wetlands110 Here again it is the interactions of different geographic features in this case climate soil and disease that can make outcomes very different from what they might seem from a comparison of individual gross features such as wetlands that occur in different regions of the world  Differences in rainfall patterns also interact with the soil to make agriculture more successful in some regions of the world than in others The rainfall pattern in subSaharan Africa long dry spells followed by torrential downpours is a major handicap for growing crops in part because the land is baked hard and dry before the massive downpours wash away part of the topsoil This whole pattern contrasts sharply with the interaction of climate and soil in Western Europe or  Geographic Factors 37    in the eastern and central parts of the United States where rain falls more of less evenly throughout the year largely on fertile soils  We have noted in Chapter 1 how the interaction between latitude and the varying warmth of ocean currents makes winter temperatures in London warmer than in American cities hundreds of miles farther south than London Other interactions involving other geographic factors elsewhere likewise make temperatures very different from what they would be if determined by latitude alone or by any other factor alone The highest temperature ever recorded in Asia Africa North America or South America has in each case been recorded outside the tropics111 Even though the heat of sunlight is greatest in the tropics nevertheless the sun shines more hours per day during the summer in the temperate zones than in the tropics112 allowing a longer daily buildup of heat Thus cities in the temperate zone such as Athens and Seville in Europe or Las Vegas and Phoenix in the United States have had higher record temperatures than many cities located in the tropics including some located virtually on the Equator such as Singapore in Asia or Quito Ecuador in South America113  Clouds are another interaction with latitude because clouds intercept sunlight and reflect it back into outer space Thus the many cloudless summer days along the Mediterranean coast of Africa have produced higher temperature records in cities located in the temperate zone there such as Algiers Tripoli and Alexandria than in many cities in tropical Africa even cities very near the equator such as Nairobi or Libreville114 Altitude also affects heat so that the highest temperatures recorded in the city of Cuzco located in tropical latitudes in the Andes Mountains of South America are much lower than in cities like Paris or New York in the temperate zone115  Mountain ranges can also affect the climate of nearby regions by blocking either warm or cold air from those regions In southeastern Europe for example winter temperatures in Sarajevo may be nearly 50 degrees colder than temperatures on the Dalmatian coast little more than a hundred miles away because the Balkan mountains block off the warm air of the Mediterranean from reaching far inland116 In Asia the  38 Wealth Poverty and Politics    Geographic Factors 39  Himalayas block warm air from reaching Central Asia and block cold air from reaching India117  While we may legitimately speak in general terms about tropical climates temperate climates or arctic climates more specific questions about climates in specific places such as cities must take into account the interactions of particular combinations of factors peculiar to particular locales More generally interactions within and between geographic cultural political and other factors are necessary to understand economic and social outcomes  Many have tried to explain the fact that countries in the temperate zones are generally far more advanced economically than countries in the tropics by the energydraining heat in the tropics or by the many diseases that flourish there whose microorganisms are killed off by cold winters in the temperate zones We have also seen that the most fertile soils are seldom found in the tropics Nevertheless many people from outside the tropics have gone to live in the tropics and prospered there often far more so than the indigenous populations The overseas Chinese minority in Southeast Asia and the Lebanese minority in West Africa are striking examples   The British who settled in Australia are perhaps an even more striking example since they became the majority population of the country and about 40 percent of Australia is in the tropics People of Japanese Chinese and European ancestry are a major part of the population of tropical Hawaii and are prospering there   Ordinarily it might be expected that people indigenous to a given geographic setting would be better able to make the most of that settings opportunities and better able to cope with its disadvantages than people from a very different setting Yet the evidence seems to suggest the opposite But as we have seen in other contexts geographic environments affect people not only by the direct economic benefits or handicaps of those environments but also by the extent to which those environments facilitate or restrict the development of the knowledge skills experiences habits and values the human capital of the people themselves    If the geographic settings of the temperate zones foster the kind of human capital that promotes prosperity in whatever climate people live then it is not so surprising that peoples transplanted from temperate to tropical climates prosper more in those climates than the people indigenous to the tropics As a noted geographer observed particular cultures may thrive in regions where they could never have originated118  What cultural consequences of life in the temperate zones might be valuable in other regions that were unlikely to produce such cultures  The most striking social difference between living in the temperate zones and living in the tropics is not simply the difference in average temperatures The lifethreatening challenge that dominated the temperate zones of the world for millennia was growing enough food during the limited spring and summer months to last through the cold winter months It was an inescapable necessity for sheer physical survival to begin plowing or otherwise breaking up the land for planting when the ground thawed in the spring   This meant that peoples living where seasons changed drastically had to develop a sense of urgency about time and the discipline to adjust to its requirements qualities that were not nearly so necessary in places where food could be grown year round in addition to the availability of much food spontaneously supplied by nature in many tropical lands   The other inescapable necessity of the temperate zones where seasons are so different was saving food to store for the winter This required not only the discipline of saving but also the conversion of perishable foods like milk and fruit into storable foods like cheese and jam Here again this was not such a pressing necessity in the tropics Moreover tropical foods such as bananas and pineapples were not as storable in a hot climate as wheat or potatoes were in a cooler climate  Modern economic and technological conditions have so freed us from having to consider such things that it is easy to overlook how imperative those things were for physical survival in the millennia  40 Wealth Poverty and Politics    before humans were able to transport vast amounts of food over great distances or to have refrigerators and freezers  Much has been made of the fact that the Incas created a more sophisticated civilization than most of those indigenous to places elsewhere in the tropics However the climate in which the Inca civilization developed was not typical of either the tropics or the temperate zones Not only does the highest daily high temperature for any month average 73 degrees in Cuzco the former capital of the Incas the lowest daily high temperature for any month averages 68 degrees Despite very little change in daily high temperatures during the course of a year there is a rainy season and a dry season with variations in precipitation ranging from a monthly average of 5mm in June to 163mm in January In addition overnight temperatures range down to freezing levels in winter119  Because of differences in rainfall and differences in overnight temperatures in different times of the year there were different seasons when particular crops could be grown even though agriculture in general was a yearround activity In short while the climate in which the Inca Empire arose was not typical of either the tropics or the temperate zone its highly variable growing seasons for different crops120 did present the same inescapable challenge faced by inhabitants of the temperate zones namely the discipline of conforming ones life to a time frame dictated by the seasonally changing conditions in agriculture   With the high altitudes of the Andes Mountains offsetting the heat of tropical sunshine the empire of the Incas was tropical only in the narrowest sense of being located between particular lines on a map  ANIMALS  The geography of the Western Hemisphere is in many ways much like the geography of Western Europe especially in the generous supply of rivers and harbors in the United States as well as vast level plains  Geographic Factors 41    and in New England rich fishing regions offshore in the Atlantic Yet the indigenous cultures of the Western Hemisphere were very different from the cultures of Western Europe   This might seem to suggest that geography has had little or no influence on the economic fate of peoples However we need to recall yet again that it is the interactions of various geographic factors that are crucial to economic and social outcomes What was totally lacking throughout the Western Hemisphere when the Europeans arrived were horses oxen and other heavyduty draft animals or heavyduty beasts of burden   During the millennia before motorized vehicles were invented horses were crucial to everything from transportation to farming to warfare in Europe Without horses or oxen the evolution of the whole European economy and society would have had to be radically different And without such heavyduty draft animals or heavyduty beasts of burden as existed in Europe or the camels water buffalo or elephants elsewhere the economies and societies throughout the Western Hemisphere were in fact radically different from those in Europe   The economic and cultural repercussions reached further Nowhere in the Western Hemisphere were there wheeled vehicles Although the wheel has often been regarded as a landmark in the technological progress of the human race the value of wheeled vehicles depended greatly on the availability of draft animals to pull such vehicles The Mayans created wheels but they were used on childrens toys The issue is not the intellectual capacity to invent the wheel but the economic value of wheels in the absence of animals to pull vehicles during the millennia before motorized transport   The lack of heavyduty draft animals or heavyduty beasts of burden on land even affected what was economically feasible in water transportation At the time of the arrival of Europeans in the Western Hemisphere nowhere in North America or South America were there boats as large as the ships of Europeans much less the even larger ships that the Chinese had developed earlier The economic viability of large ships depends on the availability of means of  42 Wealth Poverty and Politics    efficiently collecting large enough cargoes on land both from the immediate ports and from the hinterlands to fill such ships before a voyage and an ability to efficiently disperse large cargoes at the destination port and into its hinterlands   A complete absence of animals capable of carrying out such tasks limits the size of vessels that are economically viable Waterborne commerce in the Western Hemisphere as of the time of the arrival of Europeans was conducted in smaller vessels such as canoes   What this meant was that the indigenous populations of North America and South America had both a smaller economic universe and a smaller cultural universe than that of peoples in Europe Asia or North Africa Not only could exotic goods travel thousands of miles across the Eurasian landmass they could also travel thousands of miles across water in large ships   These imports included many things that originated in Asia paper printing gunpowder the compass rudders stirrups spaghetti chess and a numbering system that Europeans called Arabic numerals because they first saw these numerals in use among the Arabs even though the numerals actually originated in India All these things created in Asia became part of the cultural universe of Europeans Much knowledge from the Middle East and North Africa also found its way into Europe including the agricultural and architectural advances that the North African Moors brought with them when they invaded and conquered Spain  When the British confronted the Iroquois on the east coast of North America the mental and material resources at the disposal of these two races were by no means confined to what they had each developed themselves The British had been able to navigate across the Atlantic in the first place by using the compass invented in China doing mathematical calculations with a numbering system from India steering with rudders invented in China writing on paper invented in China using letters created by the Romans and ultimately prevailing in combat using gunpowder also invented in China   Geographic Factors 43    The cultural universe matters and animals have been among the reasons for large disparities in the size of the cultural universe in different geographic settings The relative cultural handicaps of the indigenous peoples of the Western Hemisphere were not unique Similar handicaps among others restricted the cultural universe of the peoples of subSaharan Africa and still more so the cultural universe of the aboriginal population of Australia   A common handicap of lagging groups around the world has been isolation whether in mountain valleys on islands far from the nearest mainland or living where deserts obstruct access to the rest of the world A dearth of animals also contributes to the isolation of peoples living in the same environment often physically not very far from each other who nevertheless may have relatively little communication  In addition to having impediments to communication with the outside world the peoples of subSaharan Africa have had major impediments to communication with each other The dearth of navigable waterways was just one of those impediments The presence of rift valleys and jungles also fragmented many of the indigenous peoples The dearth of beasts of burden due to the tsetse fly that flourishes in much of tropical Africa and carries a disease deadly to animals completes the impediments to local transportation and communication The colorful African custom of people carrying bundles on their heads is a painful sign of a grim reality where there are few beasts of burden like horses or camels which can carry much more freight much more efficiently   Another of the cultural factors fragmenting the peoples in tropical Africa is a multiplicity of languages out of all proportion to the size of the population  Although Africans are only about 50 percent more numerous than Europeans they have nine times as many languages as Europeans Africans have about 90 percent as many languages as Asians who outnumber them nearly four to one121 Linguistic diversity is not only a sign of cultural isolation and fragmentation it contributes to the barriers separating African peoples from each other as well as from the outside world   44 Wealth Poverty and Politics    Geographic Factors 45  Isolation has not been absolute either in the Western Hemisphere or in subSaharan Africa but cultural universes have not been at all comparable in size to those in much of Europe Asia or North Africa An even more severe isolation in an even more geographically unpromising environment was the fate of the aboriginal population of Australia before the Europeans arrived there in the eighteenth century  Beasts of burden were even more completely lacking in Australia than in subSaharan Africa or in the Western Hemisphere before Europeans arrived there Such animals were totally nonexistent in Australia when the British arrived in the eighteenth century just as they were nonexistent in most of the Western Hemisphere when Europeans arrived there in the fifteenth century though there were at least llamas in the Andes where they were used as pack animals122 However llamas were not large enough to be ridden like horses Their biggest advantage was their ability to function in the rarefied mountain air where they originated  Australia had other severe geographic handicaps In the ages before modern transportation this vast island continent was isolated in the Southern Hemisphere far from the mainland of Asia and even more distant from other inhabited continents Much of the soil of Australia was of low fertility and much of the interior was a desert Rainfall was even less reliable in the interior of Australia than in subSaharan Africa with its long months without rain followed by torrential downpours In the vast interior desert of Australia there were years without rain followed by summer downpours123 This was not an environment favoring either agriculture or spontaneous vegetation  Back in times when it was common to speak more frankly about different levels of achievements by different peoples a scholarly study of world geography said that blacks in Africa taken as a whole occupy a higher economic and cultural rank than the black races of Australia and Melanesia124 When the Europeans arrived in Australia in the eighteenth century they found the aborigines lacking iron even though iron was used by indigenous peoples in subSaharan Africa more than a thousand years earlier and even though Australia had some of the    worlds largest iron ore deposits Again the role of geography has not been simply as a direct supplier of natural wealth but also and more importantly as a facilitator or impediment to a larger cultural universe from which to gain the knowledge to turn natural resources into wealth  The Australian aborigines likewise lacked a knowledge of animal husbandry and many kinds of agriculture known to the peoples of subSaharan Africa among other peoples in geographic settings with the physical prerequisites for acquiring or developing such knowledge But even during the era of genetic determinism in the early twentieth century not everyone attributed the lags of the Australian aborigines to genes   The aborigines lack of knowledge of things known to others according to a geographic study published in 1911 must be attributed to their insularity such as was also the case among the native Canary Islanders125 who are classified as Caucasian by some126 The fundamental problem of the Australian aborigines was seen as the geography of Australia the classic ground of retardation127 shielding the interior tribes especially from external influences and leaving them with the most primitive customs and beliefs128  This isolation applied to animals as well as human beings None of the animals of Asia the next nearest continent was present in Australia when the British arrived in the eighteenth century129 Animals that were common in other parts of the world such as bears monkeys hoofed animals and the various kinds of cats from house cats to lions and tigers were also nonexistent in Australia130 like the cattle sheep and goats already mentioned   Nor were such Australian animals as kangaroos or koalas indigenous elsewhere Most of the trees in Australia were of the Eucalyptus family which is indigenous nowhere else Many kinds of plants birds and freshwater fish were also unique to Australia To a remarkable extent Australia was for millennia its own separate world biologically   The isolation of the island continents flora and fauna gives some idea of the isolation of its human beings But the same conclusion is  46 Wealth Poverty and Politics    reinforced by genetic studies of the aborigines which indicate that unlike most other races they had little or no racial intermixture until historically recent times131 Multiple evidences point toward an isolated land and an isolated people There was similar evidence of prolonged isolation in the Canary Islands where there were hundreds of plants unique to those islands132 and a backwardness similar to that of the Australian aborigines though the two groups are racially different and located thousands of miles apart  In Australia as in the Western Hemisphere the arrival of Europeans led to the transplanting of European animals and even more important the transplanting of European knowledge gathered from vastly larger geographic regions forming a far larger cultural universe than that available to the indigenous population of Australia  Europeans largely avoided the huge interior desert of Australia and settled primarily around the coastal fringes of the continent concentrated in cities that could be supplied with food from advanced agricultural practices developed elsewhere and from domesticated animals brought from Europe cities that would not have been viable for huntergatherers such as the aborigines   The low fertility of much Australian soil was compensated by the presence of rich natural resources including not only iron ore but also titanium ore of which Australia became the worlds leading exporter133 But what were natural resources for the Europeans were not natural resources for the Australian aborigines lacking exposure to the scientific knowledge developed over the centuries in a cultural universe extending across the vast Eurasian landmass and including the Middle East and North Africa   DISEASES  Europeans knew of the existence of Africa thousands of years before they learned of the existence of the Western Hemisphere Yet European empires were established in the Western Hemisphere  Geographic Factors 47    48 Wealth Poverty and Politics  hundreds of years before the scramble for Africa began in the late nineteenth century and led to European colonial empires that extended throughout the continent Diseases had much to do with the differing fates of these different regions of the world Microorganisms that most of the humans involved knew nothing about at the time were on the side of the Europeans during their conquests in the Western Hemisphere But those microorganisms were on the side of the indigenous peoples in tropical Africa  The much larger cultural universe of the Europeans compared to that of the peoples of the Western Hemisphere meant a much larger disease universe as well Diseases endemic in Asia repeatedly made their way to Europe along with the goods traded across thousands of miles on the Eurasian landmass and by seaborne trade as well This international commerce transmitted diseases from Asia creating epidemics in Europe that from time to time wiped out significant fractions of the European population from a third to a half of the population in parts of Europe during the bubonic plague of the fourteenth century134 But the survivors of these devastating incursions of diseases from Asia developed biological resistance to these diseases in addition to having biological resistance to diseases originating in Europe   When European and indigenous races confronted each other in the Western Hemisphere whether in battle or in peace the microorganisms that neither of them knew about decimated the indigenous peoples while the Europeans were not nearly as vulnerable to the diseases of the Western Hemisphere   Once European diseases took root in the indigenous populations these diseases spread through whole native societies to people who had no direct contact with Europeans When Pizzaros army was marching toward the capital of the Incas people who had never seen a European were dying of European diseases inside that capital135 It was said of a kindly Spanish priest who went among the native peoples of the Western Hemisphere in friendship as a missionary that he was probably responsible for more deaths among them than    Geographic Factors 49  even the most brutal conquistador136 It was not uncommon in parts of the Western Hemisphere for half or more of a given tribe of indigenous people to be wiped out by European diseases to which they had no biological resistance  In subSaharan Africa the tropical diseases were so deadly to outsiders that at one time the average life expectancy of a white man in tropical Africa was said to be less than one year Only after medical science reached the point where it could cope with deadly tropical diseases by either curing them or preventing them by public health measures was it feasible for Europeans to establish empires in sub Saharan Africa The swiftness with which these conquests were accomplished suggests that the human defenders in tropical Africa were not nearly as formidable as the unseen microorganisms that had held European conquerors at bay for centuries Yet again a given environment does not determine a fixed outcome because of its interactions with changing human knowledge in this case medical knowledge  North and south of the tropics the situation was very different in Africa Europeans began settling in what is now the Republic of South Africa the great majority of which is in the temperate zone of the Southern Hemisphere in the middle of the seventeenth century In ancient times the Romans incorporated much of North Africa in the temperate zone of the Northern Hemisphere within their empire There being no decisive disease barrier between Europeans and North Africans around the Mediterranean conquests went each way in different periods of history The North African Moors invaded and conquered Spain during what were the Middle Ages in Europe and retained control of Spain for centuries leaving behind both physical and cultural remains of the society they created during their reign Centuries later Napoleon said Africa begins at the Pyrenees the mountain boundary between Spain and France  Among the peoples of tropical Africa diseases contributed to their isolation from each other by their devastating effects on animals that might otherwise have become beasts of burden or draft animals that    could have helped connect different peoples as well as playing useful roles in agriculture   LOCATION  Location is a significant geographic factor even aside from the particular characteristics of the location itself For the ancient Greeks to be located near where agriculture developed in the Middle East gave them historic opportunities that they used to make historic intellectual contributions to Western civilization and the world   For the islands of Japan to be located where China was readily accessible across water meant that the Japanese had access to a civilization that for centuries was in the forefront of human advances and thus Japan could for example adapt Chinese writing to make their own language a written language This meant that the Japanese had an opportunity to become literate centuries before other peoples in Asia or elsewhere who were not located near a more advanced civilization Nor did small isolated communities have the same incentives for developing writing themselves as larger more widespread societies with numerous commercial and other interactions taking place at distances too great for verbal communication alone   The advantages of coastal peoples over inland peoples or the advantages of peoples on the plains over peoples living in mountains are advantages conferred by the simple fact of location and are advantages common around the world During the era of mass immigration from Europe to the United States Polish immigrants from Russia or from Austria Poland itself having been absorbed into these empires were almost always unskilled workers but those relatively few Polish immigrants who did have specialized work skills as weavers tailors or cabinet makers were predominantly from Prussia137 where they acquired such skills from being located in a German culture   During the era of European colonialism location near Western institutions like schools gave those segments of the conquered people  50 Wealth Poverty and Politics    in such locations major advantages over their compatriots In colonial Ceylon for example British missionaries set up schools in more favored portions of the island nation while the British authorities assigned American missionaries to the less favored northern tip of the island where the Tamil minority was concentrated But because the American missionary schools concentrated more in science and mathematics the Tamils became more proficient in these fields and better represented in occupations requiring such training A study found that members of the Tamil minority received a majority of the As on university entry exams138  In Nigeria the Ibos lived in the poorly endowed southern part of the country and had once been slaves but they seized upon opportunities provided by Western missionary schools while the Muslim peoples of the north rejected schools run by Christian missionaries The Ibos rose to such professional administrative and business occupations as were open to Africans far more so than the peoples in northern Nigeria and dominated such occupations even in northern Nigeria  The location of the United States insulated by two oceans from the wars that ravaged Europe and Asia enabled the American people to develop their own way of life in relative peace using the culture that had developed in Europe without having to suffer the devastating wars that their European ancestors and contemporaries had to endure By contrast Mediterranean islands like Sicily and Malta were located in the path of contending nations and empires that for centuries fought each other over and on the territory of these islands leaving behind a legacy of destruction conquest and both culturally and genetically altered populations   While Britain is an island even closer to the nearest continent than various islands in the Mediterranean it has not been located in the crossfire between contending empires Moreover the rough waters of the English Channel have been more of an obstacle to conquering invaders than the calm waters of the Mediterranean   Geographic Factors 51    Nothing provides absolute protection of course After all Britain was invaded and conquered by the Romans in ancient times and by the Normans nearly a thousand years later But after eventually becoming a unified and advanced nation in the wake of the Norman conquest of 1066 Britain has not been invaded in nearly another thousand years since then What the English Channel has also done during that time has been to make it unnecessary for Britain to maintain a large standing army like those of nations on the continent of Europe sparing the British both the expense and the political dangers of large standing armies  Location has mattered not only for Britain as a whole but also for its internal constituents Being located near enough to continental Europe to have ready access to the trade and technology of its European neighbors allowed the British to gain the benefits of those continental nations that were for centuries more advanced than the British These advantages were most beneficial to England the closest part of Britain to the European coast These advantages passed with a lag to other parts of the British Isles Scotland Wales and Ireland as did the further advantages when England began to surpass its continental neighbors and lead the world into the industrial revolution  Like other geographic features location is not egalitarian The fate of whole races nations and civilizations can depend on whether they happen to be located in the right place at the right time or in the wrong place at the wrong time Moreover what was the right place or the wrong place has varied greatly over the centuries   52 Wealth Poverty and Politics    Chapter 3  CULTURAL  FACTORS  If we learn anything from the history of economic development it is that culture makes almost all the difference Witness the enterprise of expatriate minorities the Chinese in East and Southeast Asia Indians in East Africa Lebanese in West Africa Jews and Calvinists throughout much of Europe and on and on Yet culture in the sense of the inner values and attitudes that guide a population frightens scholars  David S Landes1  Geography is an influence but not predestination Much of theinfluence of geography on income and wealth derives from its effects on the size of the cultural universe available to different peoples in different physical settings An enumeration of places with rich concentrations of natural resources such as oil in Saudi Arabia or gold in South Africa would be a very poor guide to places with high incomes per capita As The Economist magazine said of Nigeria in 2014 it is rich in oil reserves but otherwise desperately poor2  Without the cultural prerequisites for developing natural resources into real wealth the raw physical resources themselves are of little or no value The natural resources we use today were even more abundant in the era of the cave man but the people of that prehistoric era were culturally not yet able to make use of most of those resources   53    Even physical capital is of little or no use without the cultural prerequisites to operate it maintain it repair and replace it as it wears out Conversely the mass destruction of physical capital as in Western Europe during World War II was followed by an economic recovery in a relatively few years This recovery has often been credited to aid from the United States under the Marshall Plan But subsequent efforts to promote similar economic development in the Third World with transfers of both financial and physical capital to the governments of these countries over a long period of decades have failed repeatedly to produce anything comparable   The difference is that the cultural prerequisites the human capital which produced the physical capital in Western Europe before the war survived the war and could produce it again But that particular human capital which developed over the centuries in Western Europe did not exist on the same scale in the Third World and could not be created overnight or even over several decades in societies with a very different set of cultures   Third World countries were not being asked to recreate their own societies after some calamity They were being asked to create a Western economy without the centuries of the particular cultural evolution that led up to those economies in the West  CULTURE  AND  ENVIRONMENT  When we try to explain differences in economic and other achievements between nations races or civilizations some argue that these differences are due to innate genetic differences in mental potential3 and others argue that differences are due to the environments in which people live Both seem to assume that all the causes of differences in achievements fall into just two categories heredity and environment In fact these terms are often simply defined that way so that whatever is not hereditary is called environmental But does this mean that for those who reject genetic  54 Wealth Poverty and Politics    determinism a groups position in American society is determined by factors peculiar to American society for which American society can therefore be praised or blamed as the case may be   A vast amount of evidence from around the world suggests otherwise There are many groups with a particular culture of their own who take that culture with them wherever they go to live in culturally very different kinds of societies Germans for example have for centuries had both a very specific set of skills and a very specific way of life whether they lived in Germany Australia Brazil Russia or the United States Cultures include not only customs values and attitudes but also skills and talents that more directly affect economic outcomes and which economists call human capital  Among the skills in which Germans have excelled has been the building of pianos The first pianos in colonial America were built by Germans who also led the way in building pianos in Australia France Russia and England4 The worlds leading optical firms designing camera lenses in the first half of the twentieth century were German including Zeiss Schneider and Voigtlnder and the leading optical firm in the United States was created by two German immigrants named Bausch and Lomb   Germans have likewise excelled in military skills literally for millennia There were German generals in the Roman legions as well as German generals in czarist Russia5 and in South America6 The United States had German generals in the Revolutionary War of 1776 and American armies fighting in Europe in both World War I and World War II were commanded by generals of German ancestry Pershing and Eisenhower respectively   Other top commanders of American military forces in World War II who were of German ancestry included Admiral Chester Nimitz who commanded the Pacific fleet and General Carl Spaatz whose bombers reduced much of Germany to rubble During the Middle Ages the Teutonic Knights conquered Prussia which became the heartland of German military prowess for centuries to come In both  Cultural Factors 55    World Wars the armies of Germany inflicted far more casualties on opposing forces than the Germans sustained themselves7  Social patterns among Germans likewise appeared not only in Germany but also in other countries around the world in cultural environments that differed radically from one another An emphasis on education was a cultural pattern found in Germany itself where kindergartens originated and where research universities were developed that were later imitated in the United States Nineteenth century Germany was one of the first European nations to have free and compulsory education as well as more teachers per capita than in many other European countries and with a higher proportion of the national output being devoted to education8  This emphasis on education was also part of the culture of Germans living in other countries including countries where the culture of the majority population had no such commitment to education The great majority of Germans living in nineteenth century Russia for example were literate at a time when the great majority of Russians were illiterate9 In German farming communities pioneering in the wilderness in nineteenth century Brazil schools appeared in the first clearings in the woods10 while most nativeborn Brazilians remained illiterate on into the early twentieth century11 In the Austrian Empire in 1900 the illiteracy rate among German males over the age of ten was 5 percent while it was 45 percent among Polish males 67 percent among SerboCroatian males and 71 percent among Romanian males in that empire12  When Czernowitz University was established in nineteenth century Romania there were more German students than Romanian students and most of the professors were German13 In Estonia a university established in 1802 by the czarist government of the Russian Empire had a majority of Germans among its students and faculty for most of the nineteenth century14 In the city of Riga in adjoining Latvia most of the education was conducted in the German language even though Germans were no more than onefourth of the citys population15  56 Wealth Poverty and Politics    Germans are just one of the groups who have taken their own particular culture with them when they immigrated to other societies so that the general environments of those various other societies were not the controlling factor in these groups economic or other outcomes in those societies How we define environment is crucial It is not simply a matter of semantic preferences If we define environment as simply the surrounding circumstances then we are left unable to account for different cultural groups having very different outcomes in the same environment creating among other things disparities in income and wealth   To account for radical differences in income and wealth among groups living in the same society environment can be defined as what is going on around a group while culture means what is going on within each group If we choose instead to define environment as all nongenetic factors then the various cultures of different groups in a given society are included in the environment of that society But what we cannot do is go back and forth between different conceptions of what environment means not if we expect to reach consistent or rational conclusions  Many other groups besides Germans have had their own respective cultures which they take with them into very different settings around the world These would include the overseas Chinese in various Southeast Asian countries and in the Western Hemisphere16 the Lebanese in West Africa Australia and North and South America17 Jews in Europe the Middle East the Western Hemisphere and Australia18 and the various peoples of India on every inhabited continent19   Given the cultural differences that these groups take with them wherever they go there is no reason whatever to expect them to have the same incomes or wealth either compared to each other or compared to the existing populations of the countries to which they immigrate Nor do the empirical data show any such equality That this is a matter of culture rather than a matter of initial wealth upon arriving in a given country is shown by how many groups have arrived  Cultural Factors 57    in various countries far poorer than the existing population of the host country and have nevertheless eventually risen above the economic level of those who were there before them  The histories of the overseas Chinese in the countries of Southeast Asiaas well as in the United States are classic examples of immigrants whose first wave arrived with little more than the clothes on their backs and a willingness to work as hard as it took for them to get ahead Often in centuries past these povertystricken emigrants from China had little or no education and knew little of the language or customs of the countries they went to   Seldom did the laws or practices of the Southeast Asian countries in which the Chinese settled offer them equal rights with either members of the colonial ruling race or with the indigenous population In colonial Malaya for example the British provided schools for the children of the Malays but the Chinese had to provide their own20 In nineteenth century America a long and painfully tragic story can be summarized by saying that the Chinese were treated even worse than in Southeast Asia21 In Peru guards were posted on an island where Chinese contract laborers were assigned the task of shovelling bird manure into sacks for export as fertilizer working under stifling heat and stench The guards were not there to prevent escape from the island but to prevent the ultimate escape of suicide22  The desperate situation of the Chinese in various other countries in the nineteenth century also led to high rates of suicide among them These suicides sometimes began in the Portuguese port of Macao on the coast of China23 where many Chinese had been lured or trapped into holding pens for the semislave trade of indentured laborers to be shipped to other countries around the world including hundreds of thousands to the Western Hemisphere Despite being mostly young men in the prime of life a majority of those sent to Cuba died under the brutal working conditions there before completing the eight years of their labor contracts24 In nineteenth century Cuba there were years when more than a hundred Chinese committed suicide25 but thousands more were simply worked to death   58 Wealth Poverty and Politics    Although most Chinese immigrants to the United States in the nineteenth century did not come through the Macao indentured labor trade circumstances in the United States were sufficiently dire that the suicide rate of the Chinese in San Francisco as late as the mid twentieth century was nearly three times the national average26  Over the years and generations Chinese in the United States have become prosperous overcoming many obstacles of which those created by others have not been the only ones The initial poverty and lack of education of Chinese immigrants to nineteenth century America was another problem they had to overcome and did But poverty has also been a problem for hundreds of thousands of new Chinese immigrants arriving as late as the twentyfirst century whether legally or illegally from Fujian province in China   Like other immigrants in other times and places the Chinese from Fujian have not scattered randomly across the United States but have concentrated in their own communities located in this case in Brooklyn New York These Fujianese have been described as really poor as in fourpeopletoasingleroom allricediet sodacan collecting poor They have crammed themselves into dormlike quarters working brutally long hours waiting tables washing dishes and cleaning hotel rooms and sending their Chinesespeaking children to the citys elite public schools and on to various universities27  It has been suggested facetiously that the first word of English these Fujianese learn is Harvard and the second word is Stuyvesant one of New Yorks elite and highly selective public high schools While most of the students admitted to the citys elite public high schools come from middle class or higher income neighborhoods a significant number come from lower income neighborhoods where the Fujianese live Fujianese parents often get their children tutored in order that they can do well on tests for admission to elite public high schools as gateways to good colleges and a better life28  Jews have been classic examples of a very similar pattern and nowhere more so than in the United States where most arrived en  Cultural Factors 59    masse from Eastern Europe in the late nineteenth century among the poorest of the immigrant groups settling in grossly overcrowded squalid and unsanitary tenements on New Yorks Lower East Side Their men usually began working as lowly peddlers on the streets and their women and children worked at home in sweatshop conditions with sewing machines whirring for long hours in the tenements doing piecework on garments29  Despite the Jews long tradition of reverence for learning and the spectacular proliferation of worldclass Jewish intellectuals in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries the initial rise of Eastern European Jews in America was not through education Although most Jews who arrived in the United States in the early twentieth century were literate in some language that did not mean that they were literate in English As a detailed study of these immigrants pointed out their literacy in Yiddish or Hebrew might serve as an index of participation in Jewish culture but it was not a language tool widely applicable within the context of economic adjustment in the United States30  A 1911 study showed that twothirds of the children of Polish Jews were behind the grade level they were supposed to be in according to age31 During the First World War so many American soldiers of Polish and Russian ancestry most of them Jews scored so low on the US Armys mental tests that testing pioneer Carl Brigham creator of the Scholastic Aptitude Test declared that the Army test results tended to disprove the popular belief that the Jew is highly intelligent32  Years later after more Jews in America acquired more knowledge of English and their mental test scores rose above the national average33 Brigham recanted his earlier conclusions He pointed out belatedly that many of the Jewish soldiers tested in the First World War came from homes where English was not the language spoken He characterized his earlier conclusions as in his own words without foundation34  Although it was not through education that Jews first rose in American society nevertheless having risen in business whether to  60 Wealth Poverty and Politics    a modest or a greater extent the Jewish immigrants then pushed their children on to educational achievements which set the stage for their rise in the professions as physicians attorneys and the like   It should also be noted that neither in the medical nor the legal profession did Jews find all the doors of opportunity open to them Jewish doctors and lawyers could go into private practice whether in Jewish or Gentile communities but they were kept out of many hospitals and leading law firms In the academic world there were quota limits on how many Jewish students would be admitted to various colleges and universities and Jewish professors were a rarity until after the Second World War Nevertheless when the barriers began coming down over the years the Jewish population had a backlog of fully qualified people ready to enter those institutions and even become disproportionately represented in them  Lebanese immigrants have had a history in some ways very similar to that of the Jews Like Jewish immigrants from Eastern Europe who settled in the United States the earliest Lebanese immigrants to Australia Brazil Mexico and West Africa were not very educated and their initial economic rise came from success in business typically beginning at the lowest level as peddlers  Lebanese immigrants to Brazil in the early twentieth century had a 29 percent illiteracy rate35 Most of the Lebanese who first settled in Mexico during the same era had not even completed elementary school Illiterate Lebanese immigrants in Mexico would often keep letters that they received from Lebanon for months until they could find someone who could read these letters to them and then write their replies for them36 Most of the earliest Lebanese immigrants to Australia were illiterate37 So were most of the early Lebanese immigrants to West Africa38  In the African nation of Sierra Leone the Creoles looked down on the Lebanese immigrants because they were uneducated and poor But the Lebanese did not remain that way long and then the Creoles contempt turned to resentment and hostility when the Lebanese became successful in business39  Cultural Factors 61    Like other immigrants in other countries around the world the Lebanese did not emigrate from random locations in their homeland nor settle randomly in the nations to which they moved The vast majority of the early Lebanese immigrants who arrived in Sierra Leone after the First World War came not from cities like Beirut but from villages where they had been peasants or similarly low level workers40 In short they came from very narrowly specific geographic locations within Lebanon and settled in very narrowly specific locations in Sierra Leone the Shiite Muslims in one area the Orthodox Christians concentrated in a different location the Maronite Christians from one part of Lebanon in another location and the Maronites from another part of Lebanon in still a different location41 Peoples behavior is no more random than geographic features despite how often intellectuals and others regard non random outcomes as strange if not suspicious  Whether in West Africa North America South America or Australia Lebanese immigrants typically began as peddlers42 sometimes following in the footsteps of Jewish peddlers as in Brazil43 where successful peddlers moved up to other work often as owners of small shops with newer immigrants from the same or other groups replacing them as peddlers Even such huge and wellknown enterprises as Macys Bloomingdales and Levi Strauss among the Jews and Haggar and Farah among the Lebanese began at the level of the lowly peddler Here as among other groups that rose from poverty to prosperity dogged perseverance over the years was the key   In the United States where largescale immigration from Lebanon began in the late nineteenth century most of the early immigrants including women and children began as itinerant peddlers with Lebanese peddler networks spreading literally across the country44 After a Lebanese peddler became financially able to settle down with his own store it was usually a family enterprise open 16 to 18 hours a day with children stocking the shelves and making deliveries and with wives sometimes relieving their husbands in the store in  62 Wealth Poverty and Politics    Cultural Factors 63  addition to their other tasks in the home Home was often next door to the store or upstairs45  This pattern was very similar to that among Lebanese in Sierra Leone46 as well as among the Chinese in Southeast Asia or Jews in the United States Milton Friedman was raised in living quarters over his familys store a pattern that he described as common among the immigrants to America in that era47 Lebanese children were inducted into the family business and its requirements at an early age  Schoolage children when not in school were at their parents elbows waiting on customers making change stocking shelves and imbibing the shrewdness of operating an independent business on meagre resources They were inculcated with the parents work and thrift ethics and the lesson that family unity and selfdenial was essential to the familys goals48  In country after country successive generations of Lebanese moved up step by step Commerce was the occupation of most of the early Lebanese immigrants whether in Argentina49 Australia50 Sierra Leone51 various Caribbean islands52 or the United States53 among other places But Lebanese success in business later allowed them to give their children more education including education at colleges and universities This too happened in a number of countries in which the Lebanese settled54 and increasing numbers of new immigrants from Lebanon in later years also arrived already welleducated   With the Lebanese as with the overseas Chinese and the Jews what mattered was not that they first arrived in various countries as immigrants with very little education but that they came from a culture which valued education highly so that once they became financially able to do so they saw to it that their children acquired higher education and thus could expand their horizons from commerce to the professions such as medicine law and science as many did   The patterns of upward mobility seen among the overseas Chinese the Jews and the Lebanese are of course not the only patterns of upward mobility Many Cubans who had been professional and business people in their homeland before Fidel Castro seized control    64 Wealth Poverty and Politics  and imposed Communism in Cuba fled to the United States where they were concentrated in nearby Florida Unable to take much of their physical wealth with them to America and usually unable to resume the same professions they had back in Cuba since their educational or occupational credentials carried no weight in the United States these refugees found themselves suddenly at the bottom economically As one account put it they crammed into small apartments and became dishwashers janitors and tomato pickers55  For the overwhelming majority the story of their success was one of arduous toil swallowed pride and sacrifice for their children Former executives parked cars judges washed dishes doctors delivered newspapers Women who had never held jobs before worked as seamstresses hotel maids or shrimp sorters at warehouses by the Miami River work so painful they called it la Siberia As one migr put it I was determined that my children would be middle class even if I had to have two jobs which I did for fourteen years56  Yet these Cuban refugees who found themselves at the bottom when their exodus began in 1959 had children who by 1990 earned more than 50000 a year twice as often as white Americans Forty years after these Cuban refugees arrived in the United States the total revenue of Cuban American businesses was greater than the total revenue of the entire nation of Cuba57 Similarly as late as 1994 the 57 million overseas Chinese produced as much wealth as the one billion people in China58  Yet again all this takes us back to the question What do we mean by environment If we mean simply the immediate surroundings then it is hard to see why other groups living in the same immediate surroundings as the Fujian Chinese in New York and on the whole living at higher economic levels do not get their children into the citys elite public high schools as often as the Fujianese do Nor is it obvious why nativeborn white Americans do not have high incomes as often as Cuban Americans do   If instead we see environment as including the cultural values that led the Fujianese to make extraordinary sacrifices for the    Cultural Factors 65  education of their children or Cuban American refugees to make similarly extraordinary efforts to lift their families up from the bottom then this situation is less puzzling because it is obvious that not all groups have these same cultural imperatives But while this makes the problem of understanding the success of these extraordinary groups less puzzling it also makes the task of trying to get other groups to do the same far more daunting   CULTURAL  DIFFUSION   The history of outsiders attempts to change the culture of others has largely been a history of failure The centurieslong attempts of Christian Europe to force Jews to change their religion is just one example The Czars Russification program likewise created more resentment than results Yet cultural diffusion has taken place on a massive scale by particular groups races nations and civilizations borrowing particular cultural features from others for their own benefit by their own choices and at their own paces  Western civilizations replacement of Roman numerals by Arabic numerals even in countries that were once part of the Roman Empire and which retained many other features inherited from Rome was a result of voluntary decisions made throughout Western societies without any campaigns of persuasion by Arabs or by the people of India where such numbers originated Arabic numerals were simply better not merely different as multiculturalists might say when it came to mathematical operations Just writing the year of Columbus voyage to the Western Hemisphere in Roman numerals MCCCCXCII shows the cumbersomeness of these numbers and mathematicians have other objections   The point here is that cultural borrowing has long taken place on a large scale for largely practical reasons We have already noted the many cultural features of Asia that spread to Europe over the centuries A similar process of cultural diffusion occurred between different    regions within Europe Among the cultural advances that spread over the centuries from Western Europe to Eastern Europe were coins castles crossbows paved streets printing presses power looms vaccinations railroads and automobiles59 But just as outsiders attempts to force changes in other peoples cultures have largely failed outsiders attempts to artificially prolong the longevity of a particular groups cultural features preserving them as if they were museum pieces can be a serious disservice especially to groups lagging behind economically or otherwise  Not all groups races nations or civilizations have been equally receptive to absorbing cultural advances from others Differences in receptivity are among the many cultural differences among groups In some cases however geographic or other handicaps impeding the progress of a group or a nation have been overcome by absorbing advances made by more fortunate peoples elsewhere and then using and improving those advances for their own economic or other benefit  Japan was a classic example of a country lacking the geographic advantages of more fortunate nations that had pioneered historic advances By contrast with ancient Chinas many outstanding natural harbors and extensive network of navigable rivers along with unusually fertile land across its northern region Japan was a much smaller country with smaller and steeper drainage areas making its rivers less navigable because their waters flow more steeply and swiftly down to the sea60 Much of Japan is mountainous with only a fraction of the countrys land being level enough for agriculture61 Japans largest level plain is only 120 miles long62 In addition there is a dearth of natural resources in Japan   Given these geographic handicaps it is not surprising that Japan lagged for centuries behind the economic level of China during the era of Chinese world leadership in many fields One of Japans few geographic advantages has been its accessibility to the sea so that its coastal areas have been in communication with the outside world Moreover these coastal areas are a substantial proportion of the total  66 Wealth Poverty and Politics    Cultural Factors 67  land area of Japan where no part of the country is more than 70 miles from the sea63  Among other things this meant that the more advanced culture of China was physically accessible to Japan for more than a thousand years More important Japan was culturally receptive to aspects of the Chinese culture In addition to adapting Chinese writing to create a written version of the Japanese language Japan also adopted some Chinese philosophical ideas as well as such mundane things as the cultivation of cotton and the technology for spinning and weaving it into cloth64  For more than two centuries however the government of Japan cut the country off from much of the outside world From 1638 to 1868 emigration from Japan was forbidden on pain of death and Japanese who happened to be abroad at the time of this decree were forbidden to return According to leading scholars of East Asian history The Japanese who had been technologically and institutionally abreast of the Europeans in many respects and ahead in some at the start of the seventeenth century fell drastically behind65 Isolation took its toll in Japan as it has elsewhere  The historic shattering of Japans barriers against the outside world came abruptly in 1853 with the intrusion of Commodore Matthew Perrys American warships into Japan That Perry could sail into Japanese waters with impunity was one indication of Japans weakness and backwardness at that time The countrys backwardness was further revealed by the reaction of the Japanese people to a train that Perry presented as a gift  At first the Japanese watched the train fearfully from a safe distance and when the engine began to move they uttered cries of astonishment and drew in their breath  Before long they were inspecting it closely stroking it and riding on it and they kept this up throughout the day66  In the years following Commodore Perrys mission Japanese receptivity to Western culture became extraordinary approaching adulation The United States was singled out for special praise and    depicted as an earthly paradise67 Euphoric depictions of the United States were part of a general depiction of Western peoples and nations as enviable and great  As an indication of the economic level of nineteenth century Japan its per capita purchasing power in 1886 was onefortieth of that in the United Kingdom though by 1898 this had risen to one sixth68 Japans rise to an economic parity with the leading Western nations over the next century was achieved by a mass importation of Western technology and Western experts to begin teaching that technology in Japan while Japanese students were sent overseas to study in Western universities While fewer than half of Japanese children were going to school in 1886 by 1905 that had risen to 95 percent and continued rising69  By the beginning of the twentieth century Japans own people had advanced to the point where most foreign experts were no longer needed and were gone70 During the first half of the twentieth century Japan was producing many industrial products though much of what it produced during that era were cheaper imitations of Western products and not of the highest quality However the second half of the twentieth century saw the Japanese become pacesetters in both  68 Wealth Poverty and Politics   There were later reversals of these attitudes in Japan during the early twentieth century as fanatical nationalism arose Those Japanese emigrants who went to the United States during the earlier proAmerican period largely remained loyal to the United States during the Second World War despite having been discriminated against before the war and despite being interned during the war But Japanese emigrants who went to Brazil during the later nationalistic and antiWestern period remained loyal to Japan throughout the war and refused to believe the news that Japan had surrendered That Japanese Americans were loyal to the United States despite being discriminated against and interned while Japanese in Brazil were loyal to Japan despite being treated better in Brazil than Japanese in the United States and not being interned suggests again that environment must be defined to include the culture originating within the group See

evolution was especially striking in photography However the first Nikon camera was an obvious imitation of a German camera called the Contax and the first Canon camera was a copy of Germanys worldrenowned Leica But as time went on Japans Nikon and Canon cameras were developed into standardsetters in their field and their sales eclipsed the sales of the cameras they had initially imitated Japan also produced highspeed trains that eclipsed anything produced in the United States  Although Britain and Japan have been culturally quite different in many ways they were nevertheless similar in being island nations that for centuries lagged behind the progress on the mainland nearest them that is continental Western Europe and China respectively Britain and Japan were also very much alike in having cultures that were receptive to absorbing the advances of other nations and eventually developing these advances further eventually surpassing their erstwhile superiors   Within Britain the Scots likewise absorbed much from the English beginning with the English language and eventually rose to surpass the English in engineering and medical science71 From the late eighteenth century through the first half of the nineteenth century a disproportionate share of the leading British intellectuals in a variety of fields were of Scottish ancestry These included David Hume in philosophy Adam Smith in economics Joseph Black in chemistry James Watt in engineering Robert Burns and Sir Walter Scott in literature James Mill and John Stuart Mill in economics and politics and Robert Adam who was internationally renowned for his designs of everything from palaces to book bindings72 As a noted historian put it in every branch of knowledge this once poor and ignorant people produced original and successful thinkers73  During the Middle Ages Europe as a whole learned much from the Islamic world of the Middle East and North Africa especially in mathematics and philosophy but also in agriculture and architecture  Cultural Factors 69    70 Wealth Poverty and Politics  Militarily as well the Islamic world was more advanced at that time The Ottoman Empire invaded and conquered much of Southeastern Europe while North African Moors invaded and conquered Spain As the distinguished British magazine The Economist put it in 2014  A thousand years ago the great cities of Baghdad Damascus and Cairo took turns to race ahead of the Western world Islam and innovation were twins The various Arab caliphates were dynamic superpowers beacons of learning tolerance and trade Yet today the Arabs are in a wretched state74  Anyone who doubts the cultural and technological level achieved by the Islamic world a thousand years ago need only visit the great mosque in Cordoba built when the Moors were the ruling conquerors of Spain As for tolerance when in 1492 Christian Spain finally freed itself and drove out the last of the Moors it also expelled Jews en masse more of whom fled to the Islamic world than to Christian Europe which was at that time less tolerant than Islamic North Africa and the Ottoman Empire That world was obviously quite different from the world of today Part of the difference reflects a difference in receptivity to other cultures  Eventually the Western world would overtake the Middle Eastern and North African countries both militarily and in terms of science and technology But now the Islamic countries were by no means as receptive to the cultural advances made in the Western countries as the West had once been when the countries of the Middle East and North Africa were ascendant  One revealing sign of this lack of cultural receptivity is that in todays Arab world about 300 million people in more than 20 countries75 the number of books translated from other languages has been just onefifth of the number translated by Greece alone for a population of 11 million people Over a fiveyear period a United Nations study showed that the number of books translated in the Arab world was less than one book for every million Arabs while in Hungary there were 519 books translated for every million people and in Spain 920 books per million people76 Put differently Spain    Cultural Factors 71  translates more books into Spanish annually than the Arabs have translated into Arabic in a thousand years77  Cultural isolation can have effects very similar to the effects of geographic isolation making it harder for individuals groups nations or whole civilizations to keep up with the advances of others Chinas decline from world leadership in many fields was likewise marked by resistance to learning from others   Early in the fifteenth century the government of China imposed severe restrictions on contacts with the outside world destroying the large ships in which a Chinese admiral had made voyages of exploration covering longer distances than Columbus much smaller ships Such voyages were now not only forbidden but the building of ships capable of making such voyages was banned and records of earlier voyages to what were regarded as the lands of foreign barbarians were destroyed A twentyfirst century American scientist assessed Chinas position as of the time this fateful decision was made  Before the decision China had a fleet of oceangoing ships bigger and more capable than any European ships China was roughly level with Europe in scientific knowledge and far ahead in the technologies of printing navigation and rocketry As a consequence of the decision China fell disastrously behind in science and technology and is only catching up now after six hundred years78  In the eighteenth century when Englands King George III sent gifts to the emperor of China that included various devices showing technological advances in the West the emperor of China replied that there was nothing China lacked He said We have never set much store on strange or ingenious objects nor do we need any more of your countrys manufactures79 A rejection of advances from another culture could hardly have been more explicit or more catastrophic as China became ever more vulnerable to Western imperialism as the technological gap between the two civilizations widened   Since no given culture is better in all things much less for all time a lack of receptivity to the cultural advances made by others is a self    imposed isolation that can be as damaging as isolation imposed by geography  Another major factor in cultural isolation among countries around the world is language It has been said that Knowledge travels in the baggage of languages80 But not all languages contain the same amount or range of written knowledge The languages of Western Europe developed written versions centuries before the languages of Eastern Europe because Western Europe was conquered by the Romans and acquired Latin letters as a result This centurieslong head start in literacy meant that even after the languages of Eastern Europe developed written versions they did not instantly acquire the range volume or variety of knowledge available in the languages of Western Europe   Even though Estonians for example had a written language in the nineteenth century most of what was written in that language during the first half of that century was confined to religious subjects But the working language of educated people in Estonia was German whether a particular individual was of German ancestry or not81 Nor was this situation unique to Estonia Although the Czech language had an earlier and wider literature in Bohemia this literature had declined by the early nineteenth century and the Czech press at that time was said to be still in its infancy with a circulation only a fraction of that of the German newspaper in Prague82 Elementary schools for Czech children were taught in their native language but before 1848 there was no high school in Bohemia that taught in Czech To advance to that level required a child to know German83  For many people in Eastern Europe becoming educated for careers in science or in various professions meant being educated in the German language Moreover given the prevalence of ethnic Germans in many higher occupations in parts of Eastern Europe entering many elite occupations there often meant acquiring the German culture in general to fit in with elite colleagues   Many among the rising generation of educated Czechs and Latvians greatly resented having to change their language and culture  72 Wealth Poverty and Politics    in order to advance in the world Ethnic Germans of course had no such obstacle to overcome so no one could claim that this situation was fair But the more fundamental question is whether this unfairness was something inherent in the circumstances of the time and place or something arbitrarily inflicted on nonGermans in Eastern Europe   While the argument could be made that Germans ruled the Habsburg Empire and so could be accused of treating other groups unfairly very similar patterns existed in Romania ruled by Romanians and in Latvia and Estonia then parts of the Russian Empire ruled by Russians  The practical question was whether the presence of substantial German minorities in various parts of Eastern Europe including both the Baltic and the Balkans increased or decreased the opportunities of the peoples indigenous to that region From an economic standpoint it is clear that culturally German educational institutions were open to people who were not Germans and so were available sources of human capital that were not equally available in the languages of the indigenous populations of Eastern Europe   Similarly those rural villages in Eastern Europe that were largely populated by German farmers were allowed by Eastern European rulers to live under German law allowing both Germans and nonGermans living in those villages greater freedom than in most of the rest of Eastern Europe84 Moreover the presence of Germans with higher skills than those in the indigenous population benefitted the whole economy providing both additional products and additional jobs for the indigenous population It was precisely the Germans farmers greater skills and productivity which had prompted Eastern European rulers to welcome them and provide incentives for them to immigrate  From a political perspective however Germans in Eastern Europe were seen by many Eastern European peoples as an alien elite dominating business and the professions and their culture was seen as a barrier to the indigenous peoples rather than an opportunity to advance themselves by acquiring the advantages available to them in this foreign  Cultural Factors 73    culture that was not equally available in their own culture at that time and place But the Latvian intelligentsia for example saw Latvians as a people consigned by long oppression to lowly stations in life85  The situation of the Germans in Eastern Europe was by no means unique on the world stage Much the same combination of economic advances and social resentments was created by the presence of the overseas Chinese minority in such Southeast Asian countries as Thailand Vietnam the Philippines Malaysia and Indonesia86 Few among the indigenous peoples of these countries sought to acquire the culture of the overseas Chinese including their willingness to work hard for long hours certainly not as many as resented Chinese domination in education industry and commerce  Much the same pattern appeared in other countries where either a foreign minority or a different ethnic group within the same country but with a different culture outperformed the local majority population in educational institutions andor in the economy These would include at various times and places Armenians in the Ottoman Empire Ibos in Nigeria Tamils in Sri Lanka Indians and Pakistanis in East Africa Japanese in Peru Indians in Fiji Jews in Eastern Europe and Lebanese in West Africa among others   The political incentives in these and other countries have been to demonize whatever minority outperformed the majority population often accusing these minorities of taking over whole industries even when in fact they created industries that had not existed before However the political mobilization of resentment turned out and in some countries such as Sri Lanka and Nigeria it produced horrific civil wars this politicizing of group differences operated against a receptivity to human capital available from more successful cultures   Often instead politics promoted a sense of grievance against those with a more successful culture and a sense of entitlement to some demographically based fair share of jobs and incomes As an ethnic leader in India expressed it Are we not entitled to jobs just because we are not as qualified87 An ethnic spokesman in Nigeria similarly decried the tyranny of skills88  74 Wealth Poverty and Politics    Implicit in this focus on demographically based fair shares of economic benefits is an assumption that questions about sharing the wealth can be separated from questions about producing that wealth in the first place But the damage to national economies after the expulsions of productive minorities suggests otherwise whether it was the expulsion of the Asians from Uganda in the 1970s89 the expulsion of the Germans from Czechoslovakia after the Second World War90 the expulsion of the Moriscos from seventeenth century Spain91 or the expulsions of Jews from France and various German cities in medieval times92  Similar economic damage has been done in countries where hostile policies by governments or outright violence by mobs led productive minorities to flee as the Huguenots fled from France in 168593 or as Jews fled Eastern Europe in the late nineteenth century94  Hostility to more productive minorities who both increase the national standard of living and provide cultural examples and opportunities for members of the majority population to acquire the human capital of a more advanced culture in order to advance themselves might seem to be irrational But it is quite rational from the standpoint of the selfinterest of leaders of lagging groups to keep the groups they lead resentful of more advanced groups and to blame those advanced groups for their own groups failure to share more fully in the economic benefits created by skills and knowledge that are not as prevalent in the lagging groups own culture   Looked at differently to the extent that individual members of lagging groups acquire the skills and cultures of more advanced groups they may be absorbed into these groups or at a minimum feel less need of their own group leaders However economically beneficial various aspects of the culture of more advanced groups might be to the lagging group as a whole the absorption of that culture is a clear threat to group leaders who see the erosion of the indigenous culture as the erosion of their own role as leaders and the piecemeal loss of their constituency Indeed fear of cultural erosion and ultimately  Cultural Factors 75    extinction has been expressed by the leaders and the intelligentsia of many lagging groups at various times and places around the world95  An eighteenthcentury Czech scholar for example expressed fears that the increased use of the German language among fellow Czechs meant that the next generation will already be German and in fifty years more German than Czech will be spoken in the cities of Bohemia96  Nor were such fears groundless As a later historian said of that era Czechspeakers preponderated in Prague only among the lower classes and though the Czech language as such was by no means close to death it had retreated to the fields the stables and the kitchens where it was spoken by servants and subordinates and was at this point in history a badge not of nationality but of ignorance97 Most servants in Prague during this era were Czech except for an occasional German nurse or governess Most German households had servants and most Czech households did not98  Halfway around the world in twentieth century Sri Lanka with its Sinhalese Buddhist majority speaking Sinhala and its Tamil Hindu minority speaking the Tamil language the same fear was expressed that the more successful minority would culturally absorb the less successful majority over time Sinhala language activists in 1956 warned Buddhist priests that if they didnt do something there would be no more Buddhism and no more Sinhalese99  It was much the same story in Canadas province of Quebec in the 1970s where the Frenchspeaking majority severely restricted by law the use of English in many institutions including private businesses The chief architect of this policy Cultural Development Minister Camille Laurin declared that French must become the common language of all Quebeckers As elsewhere this was because of a need for Frenchspeaking Quebeckers to concern themselves constantly with their cultural survival and their own inferior economic and political positon100 in Canada Similar fears of cultural extinction for similar reasons have been expressed in Fiji Pakistan Malaysia the Philippines and Burma101  76 Wealth Poverty and Politics    Cultural Factors 77  Legal restrictions on the use of nonmajority languages that seem almost inexplicable in their scope and pettiness whether in nineteenth century Bohemia or in twentieth century Quebec102 are at least comprehensible as part of the drive by group leaders and group intelligentsia to prevent the cultural coopting of members of lagging groups These group leaders and intelligentsia have been trying to stave off the assimilation and absorption of fellow group members into economically more advanced groups Today in America black youngsters seeking to speak the standard English of the larger society often as part of a more general absorption of educational and other components of the larger culture have been accused of acting white a charge that can bring anything from ridicule to ostracism to harassment or outright violence from fellow blacks103  In short in many times and places there have been many obstacles to cultural receptivity among lagging groups The enthusiastic embrace of aspects of a different culture by eighteenth century Scots and nineteenth century Japanese was a rare exception So too was the spectacular rise of Scotland and Japan to the forefront of world achievements in a remarkably short time as history is measured   On a smaller scale various groups within particular nonWestern countries seized upon educational opportunities presented by the presence of Western educational institutions during the era of European colonialism Like the Scots and the Japanese these groups often came from regions with geographic handicaps such as soil too poor for the people in the region to support their growing population The Ibos in the southern part of Nigeria and the Tamils in the northern part of Sri Lanka were among such groups in various times and places including Indonesia Algeria and the Philippines104 Armed with Western education and other Western cultural advantages the Ibos and the Tamils spread out to other regions of their respective countries outperforming other groups in businesses civil service and the professions bringing benefits to the general population and at the same time stirring resentments of their striking success     78 Wealth Poverty and Politics  CULTURE  AND  PROGRESS  Economic progress depends upon both tangible physical factors like geography and intangible cultural factors like human capital including what has been aptly called the radius of trust within which individuals and groups cooperate in economic and social endeavors Attitudes toward work and attitudes toward progress itself are also among the intangibles that combine with tangible factors like geographic features and physical capital to produce economic end results What is tangible may make a stronger visible impression but it is by no means certain that its economic effect is greater than the intangibles included in the concept of culture   Among the many ways that cultures differ is in the ability of individuals and groups to trust and cooperate with one another The radius of trust differs greatly from one group race nation and civilization to another and these differences have major implications for disparities of income and wealth between nations or within nations   Trust and Honesty While trust permits many mutually beneficial forms of  cooperation trust without trustworthiness is a formula for disaster The level of honesty in a given society limits the radius of trust in that society and this can have an economic impact that outweighs many tangible advantages of a given society  The Soviet Union for example was one of the most richly endowed nations on earth if not the most richly endowed in natural resources It was one of the few industrial nations with such an abundance of petroleum that it was a major exporter of oil It contained soil of legendary fertility and the worlds largest level plains105 The Soviet Union also had the worlds largest reserves of iron ore onefifth of all the forested land in the world the worlds secondlargest deposits of manganese106 and onethird of the worlds natural gas107 in addition to being for many years the worlds leading    Cultural Factors 79  producer of nickel108 The Soviet Union was selfsufficient in virtually all natural resources and exported substantial amounts of gold and diamonds As of 1978 it supplied nearly half of the industrial diamonds in the world109  Yet despite all these advantages in natural resources and a well educated population the Soviet economy was far less efficient than the economies of Germany Japan or the United States according to a study by two of its own economists110 The standard of living of the Russian people was significantly lower than that in Western Europe the United States or Japan even though Japan is one of the most poorly endowed nations when it comes to natural resources   How could a country so richly endowed by nature have a standard of living below that of so many other countries with far less in the way of natural resources The Soviet Union was almost a tailormade refutation of geographic determinism The other influences at work that offset the countrys many natural advantages were both cultural and political Back in the nineteenth century when the country was more candidly called the Russian Empire John Stuart Mill commented on a cultural handicap that would impede its economic development  The universal venality ascribed to Russian functionaries must be an immense drag on the capabilities of economical improvement possessed so abundantly by the Russian empire since the emoluments of public officers must depend on the success with which they can multiply vexations for the purpose of being bought off by bribes111  The cost of corruption in an economy does not consist solely or even primarily of the bribes paid the money stolen or the goods pilfered The main costs consist of the things that are not done the businesses that are not started the investments that are not made and the loans that are not granted because the rate of return on such economic activities would have to be much higher to make such activities worthwhile in a very corrupt economy than in an economy in which the risks of being deprived of the fruits of ones efforts were much lower  When the czarist government sought to modernize the Russian economy in the late nineteenth century and invited Western business    firms to set up operations in Russia those firms hired Russian workers and eventually Russians in managerial positions but they made it a point not to hire Russian accountants Nor were accountants the only problem A French observer in the early twentieth century referred to the extraordinary waste to be polite that reigns among Russian administrators112 As honest as a German and as punctual as a German113 were once common expressions in Russia suggesting the rarity of such qualities among Russians themselves Why and how these cultural differences came to be what they were may be lost in the mists of time but the economic importance of such cultural qualities is plain  Widespread corruption in Russia continued even under the draconian punishments of the Stalinist dictatorship in the days of the Soviet Union Despite punishments that included years in slave labor camps the Soviet economy had whole classes of people known as tolkachi whose sole purpose was to carry out illegal economic activities on behalf of Soviet economic enterprises that could otherwise find it difficult to meet the goals set for them by central planners in Moscow within the severe limitations of what they were officially allowed to do in the governmentcontrolled economy114  The widespread corruption that existed in czarist times persisted in Russia throughout the Soviet era as well as in Russia after the breakup of the Soviet Union The stock of a Russian oil company was estimated to sell for about one percent of what the stock of a similar oil company in the United States would sell for because the market expects that Russian oil companies will be systematically looted by insiders115 Bribes of between 10000 and 15000 were required to gain admission to some wellregarded institutions of higher learning in Moscow according to a Russian newspaper which estimated that at least 2 billion a year were paid in such outlays by Russian students and their parents116  Russia was not unique though its great abundance of natural resources and low standard of living provides a dramatic example of how the benefits of tangible factors can be outweighed by the  80 Wealth Poverty and Politics    handicaps created by negative intangible factors Pervasive corruption can make the large investments needed to develop natural resources simply too risky for either local or foreign investors to take a chance  In other situations however the radius of trust can allow particular groups to prosper not only in prosperous countries but even in Third World countries with unreliable and corrupt legal systems Members of such groups as the Marwaris in India or subgroups of the overseas Chinese in Southeast Asia have been able to engage in financial transactions with one another without contracts or other recourse to the legal or political institutions of the larger society That is a special advantage in countries where the formal legal system is either ineffective or corrupt for this gives members of groups with a wide radius of trust among themselves the advantage of being able to make economic decisions faster and with less risk than can other members of such societies  A high degree of trust within particular groups can also be an advantage in more advanced economies Hasidic Jews in New York for example can sell consignments of expensive jewelry for one another on the basis of verbal agreements and share the proceeds later on the basis of these informal understandings117 The Marwaris in India have done the same across international trading networks118 In Southeast Asia the same phenomenon can be found among sub groups of the overseas Chinese119 and a similar pattern can be found among subgroups of Lebanese immigrants in West Africa and in parts of the Western Hemisphere120  While a whole society can seldom if ever develop as strong a sense of trust as that among Marwaris Hasidic Jews or subgroups of the overseas Chinese or Lebanese nevertheless some societies have a strong enough sense of honesty and decency among its people as to enable many useful economic and other activities to take place without the heavy costs and risks that restrict such activities in other societies Everything from the use of credit cards to the collection of taxes depends on most people being sufficiently trustworthy so that recourse to the forces of the law can be reserved for that segment of  Cultural Factors 81    the population which lacks the elementary level of trustworthiness required for a viable society on a large scale  While some theorists may tend to discuss people in the abstract actual fleshandblood human beings differ enormously not just from individual to individual but from group to group and from one culture to another Various tests of honesty reveal very striking differences   When a dozen wallets with money and identification in them were deliberately left in public places in various cities around the world in 2013 the number returned with the money still in them varied from eleven out of twelve in Helsinki to one out of twelve in Lisbon Moreover the one that was returned in Lisbon was returned by a visitor from the Netherlands no Portuguese returned any In Rio de Janeiro four were returned121 Earlier international tests of wallets with money in them by the Readers Digest found 67 percent of these wallets returned with the money still there in the United States 70 percent in Stockholm and 100 percent returned in Oslo Norway and in Odense Denmark In China 30 percent were returned and in Mexico it was 21 percent122  Similar contrasts among nations were found in a fiveyear study of which United Nations diplomats paid their parking tickets in New York City where diplomatic immunity shielded them from prosecution Egypt with 24 UN diplomats had thousands of unpaid parking tickets during that fiveyear period Meanwhile Canada with the same number of UN diplomats as Egypt had no unpaid parking tickets at all during the same fiveyear period Nor did Britain with 31 UN diplomats or Japan with 47 UN diplomats123  More systematic international studies of corruption have found that most of the countries rated as most corrupt were among the poorest countries even when they had rich natural resources124 Honesty is more than a moral issue It is also an economic factor whose presence or absence can be of major importance Like other factors that affect income and wealth it is neither evenly nor randomly distributed among nations or within nations   82 Wealth Poverty and Politics    Human Capital Human capital is important not just in helping a country recover  from devastating losses of physical capital such as after a war It is also a major factor in economic progress in normal times Human capital is in fact the biggest difference between ourselves and the cave man  There is a tendency by some to equate human capital with education No doubt education is one of the varieties of human capital While years of education are often used as a rough proxy for human capital in general not only is much human capital gained outside of educational institutions some education develops little or no human capital when it produces few if any marketable skills and some education even produces negative human capital in the form of attitudes expectations and aversions that negatively impact the economy Depending on its content education may sometimes create ideological aversions to working in the private sector or a refusal to do anything that does not seem to qualify as meaningful work that is work spontaneously agreeable and fulfilling in itself  The industrial revolution was not created primarily by people with much formal education It was in fact largely the work of people with practical job skills and experience rather than a mastery of science or a systematic study of engineering The industrial revolution was already well underway before formal study of science and engineering became widespread Even in later times such industrial pioneers as Thomas Edison and Henry Ford had very little formal education the Wright brothers were high school dropouts and in the electronic age Bill Gates and Michael Dell were dropouts from college In short human capital is not synonymous with formal schooling  Just as human capital takes other forms besides education so there can be widespread education without equally widespread human capital Russia in the twentyfirst century has been called a society characterized by high levels of education but low levels of human capital125 Among the more directly economic aspects of this is that while Russia has about 6 percent of the worlds collegeeducated population it has less than onefifth of one percent of the worlds new  Cultural Factors 83    patents and patent applications During the years from 1995 to 2008 Germany produced about 60 times as many patents as Russia Japan nearly 200 times as many patents and the United States about 500 times as many patents Even the small citystate of Singapore produced more patents than Russia126  None of this says that education is unimportant But both its importance as one form of human capital and its distribution require specific scrutiny rather than general celebration Here as elsewhere few things are equal among individuals groups or nations Even among collegeeducated people in different societies and cultures disparities are both common and large   Education As A Cultural Value The effects of differences between the way different cultures value  education do not end with the effect of differences in literacy rates even though literacy is a fundamental factor in the fate of individuals groups and nations Different cultures differ not only in the amount of education people seek but also in what kinds of education they seek and in the qualitative levels they achieve in that education Comparisons of people from different social groups with the same education measured in years of schooling miss the other dimensions of education and can therefore often falsely ascribe discrimination when the rewards differ among individuals from different social racial or other groups with ostensibly the same education as measured by years in school  It is not uncommon for some culturally distinct minority to have not only more education but also qualitatively better education than the surrounding majority population either in terms of education in intellectually more challenging specialties or in terms of higher individual achievements in their education In 1972 most of the As on university entrance examinations in Sri Lanka went to members of the Tamil minority rather than members of the Sinhalese majority127 During the days of the Ottoman Empire Armenian students  84 Wealth Poverty and Politics    outperformed students from the Turkish majority and even wrote better in the Ottoman Turkish language than Turkish students did128  Choices of educational specialties can also differ greatly among groups with different cultures in the same society In Malaysia during the 1960s when university admissions were still based on academic qualifications there were more university students from the Chinese minority than from the Malay majority The disparity was especially great in mathematical scientific and technological specialties During the 1960s Chinese students received 1488 Bachelor of Science degrees in Malaysia while Malay students received just 69 In engineering Chinese students received 408 Bachelors degrees during the decade of the 1960s while Malay students received just four129  In Germany in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries Jewish students were similarly statistically overrepresented in German universities130 as they were in other times and places whether in Eastern Europe Argentina or Australia131 Today in New York Citys three elite and highly selective academic public high schools Stuyvesant Bronx Science and Brooklyn Tech Asian students outnumber white students by more than two to one This is in a city where Asians are only 14 percent of the public school students132  By contrast majority groups that are lagging economically tend also to lag educationally both quantitatively and qualitatively As university students they tend to specialize in easier subjects rather than in subjects like mathematics science or engineering This in turn often leads to less promising careers or to unemployment What one study referred to as the welleducated but underemployed Czech young men in the nineteenth century133 had many counterparts in other countries in the twentieth century when the educated unemployed became a common expression whether in Europe Asia or elsewhere134  People who have acquired academic degrees without acquiring many economically meaningful skills not only face personal disappointment and disaffection with society but also have often  Cultural Factors 85    become negative factors in the economy and even sources of danger especially when they lash out at economically successful minorities and ethnically polarize the whole society they live in  In various Eastern European countries between the two World Wars such newly educated young members of lagging majorities provided much of the membership of antiSemitic movements135 which became politically powerful leading to discrimination and even violence against Jewish students in the universities Not only were frustrated young graduates from majority populations many the first generation of their families to reach higher education among the disaffected who blamed better prepared minorities for their own lags the intelligentsia of lagging groups have likewise promoted group identity ideology and group identity politics   This pattern extended far beyond Eastern Europe In many places and times softsubject students and intellectuals have inflamed hostility and sometimes violence against many other successful groups whether in India136 Hungary137 Nigeria138 Kazakhstan139 Romania140 Sri Lanka141 Canada142 or Czechoslovakia143 In contemporary America many colleges and universities have whole departments devoted to promoting a sense of racial and ethnic grievances against others while celebrating the isolation of group identities epitomized by ethnically separate residences on campus and sometimes even ethnically separate graduation ceremonies144  As in other places and times whether in Europe Asia or elsewhere the intelligentsia of lagging groups have celebrated andor fabricated past glories of these groups in the interest of trying to retain individuals who might otherwise be tempted to rise into the larger society When the author of the celebrated American book and television miniseries Roots was challenged on its accuracy by historians his response was I was just trying to give my people a myth to live by145  This approach was by no means unique to blacks or to the United States An international study of ethnic groups found cultural revivals to be a response reflecting an awareness of the danger of a fading group identity146

It was a hodgepodge of fine feeling and bad history with which the immigrants filled a cultural void147 Preoccupation with past glories even when they are genuine can be an impediment to receptivity to current advances available from other cultures as we have seen in the case of China and the Middle East  The pursuit of accurate knowledge and the pursuit of ideological satisfaction have been conflicting goals whether in American universities today or in universities in other times and places A history of East Central Europe between the two World Wars characterized Romanian universities in that era as numerically swollen academically rather lax and politically overheated serving as veritable incubators of surplus bureaucrats politicians and demagogues148 Decades later universities in Sri Lanka likewise had a backlog of unemployed graduates who had specialized in the humanities and the social sciences149  Despite beliefs in some quarters that education makes people more tolerant of other cultures and groups it has been precisely such newly educated groups often lacking marketable skills who have promoted group polarization whether in Europe Asia or Africa As a noted African scholar observed the educated Nigerian is the worst peddler of tribalism150  It was much the same story with the nineteenth century Czech intelligentsia including university students and school teachers who promoted Czech cultural nationalism151 Among their demands were that street signs in Prague which were in both Czech and German be exclusively in Czech152 In the town of Budweis Czech cultural nationalists demanded that there be a quota of Czech music to be played by the town orchestra153  There has been a similar insistent pettiness about language in similar circumstances in twentieth century Quebec where laws required that not only street signs be solely in French but also imposed legal restrictions on the use of English inside private  Cultural Factors 87    businesses154 Quebec authorities even tried to force pilots to communicate in French with air traffic controllers when landing or taking off Only a threatened international pilot boycott of Quebec forced the local authorities to back down on this dangerous demand that lives be risked by communication in an unfamiliar language155  Even aside from ethnic issues more years of schooling cannot automatically be equated with increased human capital Everything depends on whether more years in schools colleges and universities actually create economically meaningful skills or whether academic credentials create a sense of entitlement beyond what the holders of those credentials actually produce  This is not to say that economic benefits are the only benefits of education But it is to say that expectations or claims of entitlement to higher incomes or wealth have no basis unless the specific kinds of education and the specific qualitative level of that education actually create sufficient additional output to cover the additional income or wealth expected  When individuals from lagging groups whether racial regional or other social groups tend to take less challenging courses especially when these individuals are the first generation of their respective families to reach the college or university level such individuals are unlikely to create as valuable services as people who study such obviously useful things as medicine science or technology In many poorer countries especially the educated unemployed are often numerous enough to be not only a major disappointment but a social and political danger  Even many of those with academic credentials but no economically meaningful skills who are in fact employed are often employed in government bureaucracies since they are unlikely to be much in demand in competitive markets where employers are spending their own money rather than spending the taxpayers money Sometimes jobs in government bureaucracies may be created in order to absorb large numbers of young people who could otherwise be frustrated and  88 Wealth Poverty and Politics    embittered enough to be politically troublesome for government officials or even dangers to the society at large   In poor countries especially swollen bureaucracies and the red tape they generate are often an impediment to economic activity by people who do have the human capital to advance the economy and create much needed rises in living standards for the society at large   Attitudes Toward Work and Progress Attitudes toward work differ greatly among groups in the same  society as well as between one society and another and obviously such differences can affect the production of wealth   Many contemporaries of American antebellum Southern whites commented on the lack of a work ethic among them156 These included not only visitors from the North or from other countries but even such staunch Southerners as General Robert E Lee157 Many of the whites according to a leading Southern historian were disposed to let good enough alone and put off changes till the morrow158  When German immigrants pioneering in America cut down trees while clearing land for farming they laboriously dug the stump and the roots out of the ground so that all the land could be plowed Southerners usually either cut down the tree or even simply girdled it and left it to die and rot but in any case left the stump in the ground and plowed around it159  There were similar contrasts in the production of dairy products In 1860 the South had 40 percent of the dairy cows in the United States but produced just 20 percent of the butter and only one percent of the cheese160 The greater success of the largely German dairy farmers of Wisconsin compared to the poor showing of dairy production in the South was explained by a scholar who wrote The close attention to duty the habits of steady skillful routine accepted by butter fat producers of Wisconsin as a matter of fact are traits not yet present in southern culture161 This was said in 1932 The work  Cultural Factors 89    attitudes and practices of the South persisted into at least the first half of the twentieth century  Such differences in work habits have been common in other countries as well such as among laborers tapping rubber trees in colonial Malaya during the 1940s  Many rubber estates kept records of the daily output of each tapper and distinguished between the output of Chinese and Indian workers The output of the Chinese was usually more than double that of the Indians with all of them using the same simple equipment of tapping knife latex cup and latex bucket There were similar or even wider differences between Chinese Indian and Malay smallholders  162  Some groups avoid work not necessarily out of laziness but as a matter of principle In times past some European nobility or offspring of affluent classes considered work beneath them But the British during the reign of the Tudors were not among those with this attitude  The younger son of the Tudor gentleman was not permitted to hang idle about the manorhouse a drain on the family income like the impoverished nobles of the Continent who were too proud to work He was away making money in trade or in law163  Economic outcomes are affected not only by attitudes toward work but attitudes toward progress as well In modern industrial societies progress is more or less taken for granted but this was not always so even in countries that are today modern societies As a distinguished history of the rise of Western civilization said of Europe in medieval times the very idea of innovation was lacking men did what custom prescribed cooperated in the plowing and to some extent in the harvesting and for many generations did not dream of trying to change164  Here as in other things Britain was an exception Wealthy landowners in Britain were not content to be passive recipients of rents but actively promoted improvements in farming By the late eighteenth century England was one of the leaders in agricultural  90 Wealth Poverty and Politics    Cultural Factors 91  advances making farming in Britain very different from farming in the feudal serfdom of Eastern Europe or in the small peasant farming in continental Western Europe165 Affluent and educated classes in Britain were also active in commerce and industry as well as in agriculture letters law and politics166  By contrast newly educated young people in newly independent countries in subSaharan Africa in the twentieth century often disdained the study of agriculture even in countries where agriculture was a major part of the nations economy In Nigeria more than 40 percent of the jobs for senior agricultural researchers were vacant at one time167 In Senegal it was 1979 nearly three decades after independence before agriculture was even taught at the university level though the countrys University of Dakar had thousands of liberal arts students168  In parts of the Third World many people who have gotten an education feel that certain kinds of work are now simply beneath them This includes working with their hands even as an engineer where they recoil from the prospect of physical contact with machines169 preferring a desk job instead   The prevalence of such attitudes is another cultural handicap for any group or nation especially those currently lagging economically Sometimes the problem is not just an aversion to work or to certain kinds of work but also a lack of drive for progress Here again Americas antebellum South was an example  Techniques of Southern agriculture changed slowly or not at all So elementary a machine as the plow was adopted only gradually and only in scattered places as late as 1856 many small farmers in South Carolina were still using the crude colonial hoe There was little change in the cotton gin gin house or baling screw between 1820 and the Civil War170  The cotton gin a crucial factor in the economy of the antebellum South was invented by a Northerner When it came to inventions in general only 8 percent of the US patents issued in 1851 went to residents of the Southern states whose white population was approximately onethird of the white population of the country Even    in agriculture the main economic activity of the region only 9 out of 62 patents for agricultural implements went to Southerners171  Differences in habits and attitudes are differences in human capital just as much as differences in knowledge and skills and such differences create differences in economic outcomes As of the Civil War era the North produced 14 times as much textiles as the South despite the Souths virtual monopoly of growing cotton The North also produced 15 times as much iron as the South 25 times the merchant ship tonnage and 32 times as many firearms172  Even where the South had natural resource advantages such as iron ore and coal deposits located much closer together in Birmingham than in such other iron and steel producing centers as Pittsburgh or Gary Indiana173 Southern deficiencies in human capital among both labor and management handicapped the development of the steel industry in Birmingham174 It was much the same story of rich natural resources and poor human capital in the Southern lumber industry175 Similarly when the Southern textile industry began with the advantage of being located in one of the worlds leading cottongrowing areas much of the goods turned out in the South had to be sent to New England for dyeing bleaching and finishing176  Fortunately the South changed over the years especially in the second half of the twentieth century partly as a result of a greater influx of people from other parts of the country However such cultural changes are not easy to create in all societies or among all groups in a given society   For outsiders to attempt to change a culture may be resented as well as resisted As distinguished economic historian David S Landes put it criticisms of culture cut close to the ego and injure identity and selfesteem177 Outsiders can seldom change a culture without a receptivity to cultural changes within the lagging group itself  92 Wealth Poverty and Politics    Chapter 4  SOCIAL  FACTORS  Many social factors can affect economic differences betweennations and within nations These include the size and demographic makeup of their populations and the human capital and social mobility in their societies Like geographic and cultural factors none of these things is the same between nations or within nations  POPULATION  One of the reasons sometimes offered for income and wealth disparities among nations is that some nations are said to be overpopulated and therefore living in poverty There are other aspects of populations besides numbers that can also affect economic outcomes for individuals groups or nations These include age and mobility both geographic mobility and social mobility  Population Size Over the centuries a recurrent fear has been that the number of  people would grow to exceed the number for which there was adequate food In times past this concern has been felt from the individual family to local or national communities and many have worried that the population of the world would grow to a size exceeding the worlds capacity to provide enough food to sustain the people in it  93    In times and places where there were families so poor that they were living on the edge of subsistence it was not uncommon to kill newborn babies This was especially so when the baby was a girl because she might not grow strong enough soon enough to produce enough food for her own survival in a family where there was not enough food to keep feeding her without jeopardizing the survival of the family itself Among the benefits of economic progress was reaching a level of productivity where such desperate and anguished decisions no longer had to be made  Another benefit of economic progress has been achieving a level of productivity where the growing or gathering of food does not absorb so much of the time and efforts of so many people as to leave too little of both to devote to developing the human capital on which the advancement of civilization depends   A more favorable geographic environment might allow the people in it to have not only a higher material standard of living but also a more developed culture However there is nothing inevitable about such an outcome A less stressful geographic setting can also lead to a less focused and less disciplined society able to indulge in more convivial and festive activities when nature provides food more readily Geographic opportunities and geographic influences are not geographic determinism   Concerns over whether the world will produce enough food to sustain the people in it go back even before Thomas R Malthus famous Essay on Population in 1798 But what Malthus did was to spell out a theory in a stark and dramatic form that made the issue indelible and historic The Malthusian theory was based on two propositions The first proposition according to Malthus was that Population when unchecked increases in a geometrical ratio while subsistence increases only in an arithmetical ratio The second proposition was By that law of our nature which makes food necessary to the life of man the effects of these two unequal powers must be kept equal1  In other words if human beings did not restrain their own reproduction then famine disease and other disasters would bring  94 Wealth Poverty and Politics    population back down to what the food supply could sustain Such concerns about the sustainability of population have waxed and waned over the centuries since Malthus wrote But they have never completely died out In 2014 a New York Times writer referred to Malthus population theory as being based on an eminently sensible premise that the earths carrying capacity has a limit2 But to say that there is a limit on anything is not to say that we are nearing that limit   To go from saying that there is a limit to implying that we are nearing that limit is a classic nonsequitur far from being eminently sensible Innumerable claims that we were running out of oil coal iron ore or some other natural resource have proved false time and again going back at least as far as the nineteenth century But the worlds known reserves of petroleum at the end of the twentieth century were more than ten times what they were in the middle of that century3 when there were dire warnings that we were running out The worlds known reserves of iron ore also increased severalfold even while the production of steel was rising dramatically It was much the same story with the known reserves of other natural resources For economic reasons it seldom pays to find more than a minute fraction of a natural resource at a given time even if there is enough in the ground to last for centuries4  However plausible the Malthusian theory might seem it has consistently failed the test of empirical evidence even in Malthus lifetime5 There is no consistent correlation between population size or density and real income per capita Povertystricken subSaharan Africa has a population density that is only a fraction of that in prosperous Japan6 It is possible to find some povertystricken countries with greater population densities than some prosperous countries But there is no consistent relationship between population density and either wealth or poverty Looking at what happens over time likewise gives no support to the theory that overpopulation causes poverty As one of the leading economic development economists of the twentieth century pointed out  Social Factors 95    96 Wealth Poverty and Politics  Between the 1890s and 1930s the sparsely populated area of Malaysia with hamlets and fishing villages was transformed into a country with large cities extensive agricultural and mining operations and extensive commerce The population rose from about one and a half to about six million the number of Malays increased from about one to about two and a half million The much larger population had much higher material standards and lived longer than the small population of the 1890s Since the 1950s rapid population increase in denselypopulated Hong Kong and Singapore has been accompanied by large increases in real income and wages The population of the Western world has more than quadrupled since the middle of the eighteenth century Real income per head is estimated to have increased by a factor of five or more7  Although advocates of the overpopulation theory argue that rising population threatens to create more poverty virtually no one seems able to provide examples of countries that had a higher standard of living when their population was half of what it is today  Famines at various times and places have been taken by some as confirmation of Malthus theory But famines ceased in densely populated regions like Western Europe and Japan while they continued in thinly populated regions like subSaharan Africa Famines have been local phenomena often caused by local crop failures or by military conflicts or other disasters that interfered with the distribution of food Even when there is ample food available in the world at large not all local transportation systems have been capable of moving vast amounts of food into a faminestricken area quickly enough to avert mass starvation and the diseases to which people weakened by hunger are more vulnerable   With the development and spread of modern transportation systems famines have declined However particular places at particular times can become susceptible to famine when these places are politically isolated for political reasons Two of the most devastating famines of the twentieth century occurred in the Soviet Union in the 1930s under Stalin when millions of people died and decades later in China under Mao when tens of millions died  Neither of these totalitarian dictators was going to admit to the outside world that there was a famine in his country much less call on other countries for food since that would undermine the ideology    they were promoting internationally and perhaps undermine their own regimes Nor were the people living under these repressive regimes allowed free communication with the outside world But the longrun capacity to produce enough food to support the people was not the issue In the Soviet Union the famine was concentrated in the Ukraine which had been one of the great foodproducing regions before the famine and would be again after the famine8 In neither the Soviet Union nor in China had population exceeded the capacity of the land to feed the people and in both places today an even larger population is being fed In twentyfirst century China an estimated onefourth of the population is overweight9  Demographic Composition The mixture of ages within a given population varies greatly from  one society to another as well as among ethnic or other groups within a given society The median age in Japan Germany and Italy is over forty while the median age in Guatemala Nigeria and Afghanistan is under twenty10 Within the United States Americans of Japanese ancestry are more than two decades older than Puerto Ricans11 If we measure adult work experience from age eighteen on this means that a fortyyearold worker has more than ten times as much experience as a twentyyearold worker How can such a disparity in opportunities to acquire knowledge skills and maturity not create a disparity in economic outcomes among nations and within nations   In countries where diseases poverty and other factors produce shorter life spans a smaller share of the population reaches the ages where levels of individual productivity are highest and among those that do they remain at those levels for less time before dying  Within a given nation incomes vary greatly with age and wealth even more so Moreover these disparities among age cohorts have increased over time as the value of the physical strength and energy of youth counts for less when mechanical sources of power have rendered human strength less important and more complex  Social Factors 97    technology has made knowledge and analytical skills more valuable The net result is that the age at which people receive their highest incomes has shifted upward in the United States   Back in 1951 most Americans reached their peak earnings between 35 and 44 years of age and people in that age bracket earned 60 percent more than workers in their early twenties By 1973 people in the same 35to 44yearold bracket earned more than double the income of the younger workers Twenty years later the peak earnings bracket had moved up to people aged 45 to 54 years and people in that bracket earned more than three times what workers in their early twenties earned12  None of this should be surprising because people accumulate human capital as they grow older whether in the form of specific knowledge and skills or just maturity in dealing with other people and with the responsibilities of their work What we choose to call labor is no longer simply physical exertions in the production process Many if not most workers are supplying not only labor but human capital and the growing pay differential between experienced workers and entrylevel workers suggests that human capital is increasingly in demand in an economy that is growing both technologically and organizationally more complex  The way children are raised also differs greatly and consequentially from group to group and from one income level to another A study found that American children in families where the parents are in professional occupations hear 2100 words an hour on average Children whose parents are working class hear an average of 1200 words an hour and children whose family is on welfare hear 600 words an hour13 What this means is that over the years a tenyearold child from a family on welfare will have heard not quite as many words at home as a threeyearold child whose parents are professionals  It is painful to contemplate what that means cumulatively over the years as poor children are handicapped from their earliest childhood It is not just in the quantity of words they hear that they are handicapped They are also handicapped in both the quantity and the  98 Wealth Poverty and Politics    quality of their parents Only 9 percent of American women with college degrees who gave birth in 2013 were unmarried But 61 percent of women who were high school dropouts and gave birth that year were unmarried14  It is hard to escape the conclusion reached by The Economist magazine Nothing the government can do will give the children of Cabin Creek the same life chances as the children of Bethesda15 Equal opportunity in the sense of being judged and rewarded by the same standards as others cannot possibly mean equal life chances for children born and raised in these very different settings   Another way of saying the same thing is that the fact that life is unfair is not the same as saying that a particular institution or a particular society is unfair We cannot tell where the unfairness occurred by where the statistics were collected If the mix of children raised in welfare families is racially different from the mix of children raised in families with parents who are professionals then statistics collected at a given employers business after these children have grown to adulthood may well show a racial disparity between which employees are in higher occupations and which are in lower occupations even if the employer has treated every individual the same when hiring or promoting Even if these employees were all born into the world with identical brain cells the prospects of one set of them were enhanced while they were growing up and the prospects of the other set were blighted years earlier before either set of people reached the employer  Geographic Mobility One of the ways individuals and groups seek to raise their  economic level is by moving from places where prospects seem poor to places where prospects seem more promising These moves can be  Social Factors 99    The same implicit assumption that the cause of disparities is located where the statistics were collected underlies much fervent denunciation of the fact that the poor pay more in lowincome neighborhood stores and in interest charges for payday loans This issue is analyzed in my Basic Economics 5th edition pp 6669 281283    for relatively short distances as among shepherds leading their flocks from fields where these flocks have eaten most of the vegetation to fields where there is much vegetation still available Or the moves can be from one country to another or from one continent to another as people from various parts of Europe immigrated to America and Australia or people from India immigrated to Fiji Malaysia and Africa Like other factors affecting the economic level and progress of peoples migrations have not been even or random factors but factors reflecting many inequalities and creating more  Immigration has not been random either in the particular places in the home country from which the immigrants leave or in the particular places where they settle in the country to which they relocate A study of the immigration of southern Europeans to Australia before World War II showed that they came not as a broad scatter from southern Europe as a whole but in concentrated streams from relatively small and restricted areas and the great majority of immigrants settled fairly close together16 Nearly ninetenths of the Italian immigrants to Australia who came from the Mount Etna region of Sicily settled in the northern part of the state of Queensland while Italian immigrants from the nearby Lipari Islands settled hundreds of miles to the south in Sydney and Melbourne17  In the United States such patterns went right down to the neighborhood level During the era of mass immigration from Europe to America Italian immigrants from different places in Italy lived clustered together on particular streets within Italian neighborhoods in New York San Francisco and other American cities18 Similar clusters of Italians from particular places in Italy were also common in Buenos Aires and Toronto during that same era19  Such patterns have been common among other immigrants going to and from other countries around the world As noted in Chapter 3 when immigration from Lebanon to Sierra Leone began after the First World War most of the immigrants came from particular villages and settled in particular parts of Sierra Leone among people from the same villages and with the same religion Lebanese  100 Wealth Poverty and Politics    immigrants to Colombia likewise came from particular places in the Middle East and settled in clusters together in particular places in Colombia20 In the twentyfirst century immigrants from a particular province in China Fujian have settled together in a particular Brooklyn neighborhood21  These are longstanding patterns in countries around the world Frankfort Kentucky was founded by immigrants from Frankfurt in Germany22 and Grand Island Nebraska was first settled by SchleswigHolsteiners23 German farmers who had immigrated to Russia during the eighteenth century and then emigrated from there to the United States in the nineteenth century did not settle in existing German American enclaves much less among the American population at large These German immigrants from Russia settled in their own separate communities of Volga Germans and Black Sea Germans separate from each other as well as from other Germans and from Americans in general24  Such nonrandom clusters of immigrants from many countries living in many other countries have been the rule rather than the exception Moreover even after the era of mass immigration from Europe was over if one wished to have Americans of Northern European ancestry and Americans of Southern European ancestry living randomly distributed among one another in the New York metropolitan area in the second half of the twentieth century one would have had to move just over half of all Americans of Southern European ancestry in the New York area25  The fact that the difference between black and white neighborhoods is visible to the naked eye in a way that these other differences are not does not make the blackwhite difference unique Moreover within black communities different kinds of people have long clustered in different places A study of the black community in Chicago during the 1930s showed delinquency rates of more than 40 percent in some black neighborhoods and delinquency rates under 2 percent in other black neighborhoods26 Residential separation  Social Factors 101    between different kinds of people within black communities was also found in Harlem and in other black communities as well27  In general people sort themselves out in all kinds of groups within races as well as between races and in all sorts of countries around the world There are reasons for such nonrandom residential patterns within groups as well as between groups Like other patterns in many other kinds of human activities they are not random because people are not behaving randomly but purposefully and their purposes circumstances and values differ This is too often forgotten by people who react to nonrandom outcomes as strange if not sinister in many contexts  Social Mobility Social mobility is often discussed as a matter of individual good  fortune such as that in nineteenth century Horatio Alger novels about plucky lads who overcame adversity and eventually rose to reap their just reward But social mobility is far more important to the economic fate of nations Put differently a nation which creates obstacles to the use of the talents potentialities and achievements of some of its own people whether defined by race religion sex caste or whatever is needlessly depriving itself of a source of greater prosperity Yet that is precisely what has been done in innumerable times and places for thousands of years in countries around the world  Countries with fewer or less rigid barriers have often benefitted from the arrival of productive individuals and groups who were stifled or persecuted in the countries from which they fled Huguenots who fled religious persecution in seventeenth century France created the watchmaking industry in London and made Switzerland the premier watchmaking nation in the world28 Jewish scientists fleeing threats to their personal survival in 1930s Europe played key roles in making the United States the first nuclear superpower29 Immigrants and their children also played major roles in creating modern industries in such Latin American countries as Argentina Brazil and Chile30  102 Wealth Poverty and Politics    Internally Americans who rose from obscurity or sometimes even poverty to create or revolutionize whole industries would include Thomas Edison Henry Ford the Wright Brothers Andrew Carnegie David Sarnoff and many others whose impacts spread across the country and in some cases around the world Therefore much concern was aroused in the early twentyfirst century when claims were made that social mobility had declined greatly in the United States This concern was often expressed in terms of a setback for social justice but a decline in social mobility would also have implications for the economic fate of the country as a whole  Like so many words and phrases with great emotional and political impact neither social mobility nor social justice has been unambiguously defined A dictionary defines mobile as anything that can be moved Clearly by this definition a car with a 500 horsepower engine is mobile even if it is parked at a given time or even most of the time Another car with an engine only half as powerful would not be said to be more mobile even if the second car was used as a taxi and was therefore in motion a greater percentage of the time Mobility exists ex ante while movement exists ex post  Similarly as regards social mobility if we take mobility to mean the freedom or option to move then we have a different definition from those who measure mobility by how many people have actually moved These differences in definitions involve far more than semantic preferences They change the substance of what is being said or insinuated  To deliberately take an extreme example even a society with no barriers whatever to upward mobility in its economy may nevertheless have particular groups who do not actually move upward at all Conversely a society with many barriers to upward mobility may nevertheless have particular groups who move upward anyway overcoming or circumventing those barriers   In short we cannot determine how much mobility that is opportunity to move upward a given society has by how much upward movement actually takes place That depends also to a greater  Social Factors 103    or lesser degree on the behavior of individuals and groups rather than being solely a question of how much opportunity a given society offers It is an empirical question as to what the facts are in any particular case and we cannot allow that question to vanish into thin air by verbal sleight of hand in the definition of words Personal choices and personal responsibility for the consequences of those choices matter Everything is not solely determined by society despite how many may prefer to believe that it is  If nativeborn Americans in lower income brackets do not move up nearly as often as immigrants who arrived in those same lower income brackets the Chinese and the Cubans for example then the question must be raised whether there are external barriers to mobility blocking the rise of nativeborn Americans and which somehow exempt immigrants Such a hypothesis hardly meets even the test of plausibility A more realistic explanation might be that low income immigrants bring a different set of attitudes and values than the attitudes and values of lowincome Americans   In other words the real question is whether there are external barriers or internal cultures that account for the difference in actual movement even when mobility as an opportunity still exists for both That question has wider implications If Americans at the bottom do not rise as often as in the past while immigrants can still rise dramatically from one generation to the next then the reasons for this retrogression among lowincome Americans need to be sought as will be done in the next chapter on political factors   In the meantime we need to consider those studies which simply measure social mobility by how much movement there is up and down the economic scale It is these kinds of studies which have led many to conclude that social mobility as an opportunity has declined in America   Even within a framework that defines mobility by the amount of movement there are different questions that can be asked For example social mobility might be measured by 1 how much incomes and wealth rise within the lifetime of individuals 2 how much  104 Wealth Poverty and Politics    incomes and wealth rise from one generation to the next or 3 how much the relative positions of the latest generation differ from the relative positions of their respective parents   As regards the first question a number of studies show that the income and wealth of individuals rise substantially over their lifetimes31 For example only 13 percent of American households headed by someone 25 years old have ever been in the top 20 percent in income while 73 percent of American households headed by someone 60 years old have32 This is hardly surprising since most people begin their careers earning entrylevel salaries and then move up over the years as they acquire more experience skills and maturity   When social mobility is defined in terms of how the incomes of one generation compare to the incomes of their parents that is a fundamentally different question Fortunately two of the leading studies of social mobility in recent years Getting Ahead or Losing Ground Economic Mobility in America 2008 and an update of that study titled Pursuing the American Dream Economic Mobility Across Generations 2012 were published by the Pew Charitable Trusts which distinguishes various kinds of social mobility though some who have quoted from these studies have not One of the things these Pew studies measure is whether a person has more or less income earnings or wealth than his or her parents did at the same age33  The answer The vast majority of Americans have higher family incomes than their parents did Moreover Fifty percent of Americans have greater wealth than their parents did at the same age34  A different question addressed by the Pew studies is how a persons rank on the income earnings or wealth ladder compared to his or her parents rank at the same age35 In other words do the children end up in a higher or lower relative position in income among their contemporaries compared to their parents rankings among the contemporaries of their day To this question the answer from this study is Sixtysix percent of those raised in the bottom of the wealth ladder remain on the bottom two rungs themselves and 66 percent of those raised in the top of the wealth ladder remain on the top two rungs36  Social Factors 105    This is the crucial finding on which many commentators have based their assertion that social mobility in America is now a myth However these Pew studies themselves caution that the data do not include immigrants37 because of a lack of historical data such as were used for studying families that were in America for both parents and childrens generations This is a crucial caveat because the original 2008 Pew study itself said that its findings do not apply to immigrant families for whom the American Dream is alive and well38  If lowincome immigrants are able to move up even when native born Americans tend to stay in their same relative economic positions from one generation to the next that strongly suggests that American society continues to offer opportunities to move up economically but that not all groups make the same use of these opportunities   MENTAL  CAPABILITIES  There is a vast complex and inconclusive literature on the mental potential of different racial groups But the practical question for anyone investigating current economic disparities between individuals or groups is not what their mental potential was at birth but what human capital they developed as they grew up and can bring with them as adults to a job or a college or to the creation of a business or a scientific endeavor  Such developed capabilities have obviously varied enormously not only among racial or ethnic groups but also among people living in major urban centers as compared to people living in isolated mountain villages or other isolated or otherwise unpromising locations Nor is this a new phenomenon of modern times As previously noted the Greeks were far more advanced than the British thousands of years ago In the days of the Roman Empire Cicero warned his fellow Romans against buying British slaves since they were so hard to teach39 Given the vast cultural gulf between the illiterate tribal Britons of that era and the complex and sophisticated society of ancient Rome it is hard to imagine how things could have been otherwise With the advantage of  106 Wealth Poverty and Politics    centuries of historical hindsight we can recognize today that this disparity in human capital was not permanent which is not to deny that it was present and consequential at the time  Today with the specter of genetic determinism hovering in the background many are loath to admit that there are major differences in developed mental capabilities among racial or ethnic groups Tests that show such differences are dismissed as culturally biased tests and historical evidence of such differences is dismissed as stereotypes Racial differences in patterns of employment and promotion are treated as evidence of discrimination People who present empirical evidence of differences in current mental capabilities are often denounced as racists Such reactions are not confined to racial or ethnic leaders or spokesmen or to politicians responsive to racial or ethnic voting blocs Many academic scholars have had similar reactions and so have some Supreme Court justices  Yet such attempts to evade or discredit empirical evidence are as unnecessary as they are futile for there is other empirical evidence against genetic determinism For example there have been not merely individual whites or white families but whole communities of whites from isolated mountain regions in America whose average IQs have been similar to or lower than the average IQs of black Americans40 Mental tests given to American soldiers during the First World War likewise showed that whites from some Southern states scored lower than blacks from some Northern states41 But while such evidence undermines genetic determinism that does not make mental test differences irrelevant any more than the great achievements of the British many centuries after the decline and fall of the Roman Empire deny that Britons in Roman times were not functioning at the same intellectual level as Romans  Predictive Validity Mental tests to measure intellectual capabilities have been caught  in a crossfire of controversies However a distinction must be made  Social Factors 107    between the predictive validity of a mental test and whether it measures real intelligence however the latter might be defined Clearly no current mental test can retroactively measure native intelligence that is mental potential years earlier at birth which is what the controversies over innate intelligence are ultimately all about The predictive validity of a test however is a very different and straightforward statistical question about the extent to which a particular tests results correlate with later performances in schools on a job or in some other endeavor   Obvious as this might seem the Supreme Court of the United States ruled in the landmark case of Griggs v Duke Power Co that employers must validate tests which have a disparate impact on minority groups when those tests are unrelated to measuring job capability42  In other words the plausibility of the tests relevance to the job as judged by third parties with neither expertise nor experience in the jobs themselves must be the criterion according to the Supreme Court not the objectively demonstrated statistical correlation between the scores received on a test and the scorers subsequent performances on the job But if scores on an IQ test correlate with the quality of pilots subsequent performances in the air this means that the test is predictively valid even if there is not a single question on the IQ test that has anything to do with flying a plane Even if an IQ test does not measure real intelligence however defined if whatever it does measure is correlated with pilots subsequent performance then it is predictively valid for that specific purpose whether or not it measures innate mental potential  Educational Tests Employment tests are not the only tests under attack when they  result in different racial or ethnic groups scoring at very different levels on these tests The use of such tests to determine who will and will not be admitted to selective public high schools such as Lowell  108 Wealth Poverty and Politics    High School in San Francisco or New York Citys three highly selective high schools Stuyvesant Bronx Science and Brooklyn Tech has also been under attack especially by spokesmen for racial or ethnic groups who do not gain admissions as often as others Even larger numbers of attacks have been directed at college admissions tests across the country  With academic admissions tests as with tests for employment and promotions intergroup disparities have often been extreme At one time Jewish students were so overrepresented among those who successfully passed admissions tests to Stuyvesant High School that Stuyvesant was referred to by critics as a free prep school for Jews and a privileged little ivory tower43  Today it is Asian American students who predominate not only at Stuyvesant but at Bronx Science and Brooklyn Tech as well At all three of these highly selective schools where admissions are based on academic tests Asian American students are not only a majority of all students but outnumber white students by more than two to one44  The issues raised by critics of academic admissions tests whether at the high school or college level raise questions that go to the heart of what education is about and what its role is in the larger society The ultimate value of high performance schools and colleges is not determined by the benefits they confer on whatever individuals or groups constitute the students who pass through these institutions The most important value of such institutions consists of the benefits conferred on society at large from the work in later life of people with highpowered intellectual skills whether in medicine science or other endeavors   It is not a question of how many of these schools graduates were admitted to Harvard or by the fact that in some years more graduates of Brooklyn Tech have been admitted to MIT than the graduates of any other high school in the country45 The real value of highly selective and intellectually elite high schools is in what their alumni go on to achieve that benefits vastly more other people than themselves   Social Factors 109    The many prizes and awards accumulated over the years by students from Stuyvesant Bronx Science and Brooklyn Tech are just symptoms of their contributions to society at large These include many Westinghouse Science awards Intel Science awards Pulitzer Prizes and multiple Nobel Prizes Seven graduates from Bronx Science alone have gone on to receive Nobel Prizes in physics alone and graduates from Stuyvesant and Brooklyn Tech have also gone on to receive Nobel Prizes   That a particular student goes on to become a brain surgeon is of course significant in that individuals life but it is of far greater significance to vastly more people whose lives are saved in the course of the surgeons career Just one graduate of New Yorks selective Townsend Harris High School Jonas Salk made an incalculable contribution to society and to the world by developing a vaccine that put an end to the tragic scourge of polio  The envy and resentment of achievements that have been painful facts of life in other times and places around the world are perhaps not surprising in an educational context But such envy and resentment are certainly nothing to be encouraged to the ultimate detriment of society at large whose progress is advanced disproportionately by the achievements of people with highly developed levels of human capital   To refer to Stuyvesant High School as a privileged little ivory tower may be clever but cleverness is not wisdom Slippery use of the word privilege is part of a vogue of calling achievements privileges a vogue which extends far beyond educational issues spreading a toxic confusion in many other aspects of life A privilege exists ex ante and is fundamentally different from an achievement which exists ex post Students whose demonstrated academic achievements earn them admission to highpowered educational institutions are fundamentally different from students admitted on the basis of demographic diversity or political expediency   Whether the elite public high schools of New York were overwhelmingly Jewish in one era or overwhelmingly Asian in a later era their lack of demographic diversity seems not to have adversely  110 Wealth Poverty and Politics    affected their educational performances or their graduates achievements in later life And that is what such schools are there for not to present a tableau that matches fashionable preconceptions  Passionate advocacy of the interests of lagging minorities has seldom been followed by equally dedicated empirical investigation as to whether those minorities have actually benefitted on net balance from the success of those advocacies The triumph of egalitarian principles and demographic diversity in the rest of New Yorks educational system has not resulted in an increase in the number or proportion of black or Hispanic students passing the admissions tests to get into Stuyvesant Bronx Science and Brooklyn Tech On the contrary the numbers and proportions of black and Hispanic students have declined substantially over the years at all three institutions46  Back in 1938 the proportion of blacks attending Stuyvesant High School was almost as high as the proportion of blacks in the citys population47 But 1938 was the last year when this was true The sharpest declines occurred in the second half of the twentieth century when the socioeconomic position of blacks was far higher than in 1938 As of 1979 blacks were 129 percent of the students at Stuyvesant but in 1995 the New York Times reported that only 48 percent of the students at Stuyvesant were black48 As of 2012 the New York Times reported that blacks were now 12 percent of the students at Stuyvesant High School49  In short over a period of 33 years the proportion of blacks gaining admission to Stuyvesant High School fell to just under onetenth of what it had been before None of the usual explanations of racial disparities genetics racism poverty or a legacy of slavery can explain this retrogression over time Back in 1938 both racism and poverty were worse than in later times and the blacks of 1938 were generations closer to slavery Clearly something else was happening  Such distressing and puzzling trends present a challenge to believers in either heredity or environment where environment is defined in the usual socioeconomic terms There is no obvious or even plausible genetic reason why blacks of an earlier generation  Social Factors 111    should have been more able to meet demanding mental test standards to get into an elite public high school An environmental explanation in socioeconomic terms has even worse problems since socioeconomic conditions have clearly improved among blacks since 1938 both absolutely and relative to the general population One of the few possibilities left is that the culture within black communities has in some respect changed for the worse over the years  There have long been different cultures among blacks One has been the culture of the old South the culture which created many handicaps for white Southerners50 of which the low mental test scores of white soldiers from Southern states during the first World War51 were just one symptom  The thousands of volunteers from the North who went into the South after the Civil War to take on the formidable task of educating the children of freed slaves were led by people who operated on the premise that a major objective of that education should be displacing the Southern culture that blacks had absorbed This premise was publicly proclaimed52 in contrast to the opposite premise in our times that preserving and praising the black culture is important in education  A disproportionate share of the Northern educators who went South after the Civil War were from New England and sought to replace the Southern culture among blacks with the contrasting culture of New England Given the limited economic resources available this was possible only in a relatively few educational institutions but those few institutions produced a very disproportionate share of black leaders and pioneers in a number of fields53  One of those institutions was the first black public high school in the country founded in 1870 in Washington DC In 1899 when tests were given in the citys four academic high schools three white and one black this black high school scored higher than two of the three white high schools54  This was not an isolated fluke Although the IQ of blacks has consistently averaged around 85 over the years the average IQ at this school called by various names over the years including Dunbar  112 Wealth Poverty and Politics    High School after 1916 was consistently at or above 100 every year from 1938 to 1955 except for 1945 when it was 9955 This was in the absence of IQ tests and with many students with IQs below 100 being admitted to Dunbar on the strength of their academic records56 Nor was there diversity This school had an allblack student body during the entire 85 years of its academic ascendancy from 1870 to 1955  Most of its graduates went on to college during that era which was unusual for either black or white high school graduates in those years Some graduates began going to elite colleges in the late nineteenth century and the schools first graduate who went to Harvard did so in 1903 From 1892 to 1954 Amherst admitted 34 of these graduates Of these 74 percent graduated from Amherst and 28 percent of these graduates were Phi Beta Kappas57 Nor was Amherst unique Over the years the schools graduates went on to become Phi Beta Kappas at Harvard Yale Amherst Williams Cornell Dartmouth and other elite institutions58  In terms of their later careers the first black who pioneered in a number of fields also came from this one school These included the first black man to graduate from Annapolis59 the first black enlisted man in the Army to rise to become a commissioned officer60 the first black woman to receive a PhD from an American university61 the first black federal judge the first black general the first black Cabinet member and among other notables Dr Charles Drew who achieved international recognition for his pioneering work on the use of blood plasma62 During World War II when black military officers were rare there were among Dunbar High Schools graduates many captains and lieutenants nearly a score of majors nine colonels and lieutenant colonels and one brigadier general63  All of this from one public high school in a black community was remarkable enough What is relevant to the issue of culture was that this was a school which from its beginning had a wholly different cultural orientation from that of the ghetto culture Seven of its first ten principals were educated in a New England environment Four had  Social Factors 113    114 Wealth Poverty and Politics  degrees from colleges located in New England and three had degrees from Oberlin College which was established by New Englanders in Ohio as a deliberate project to plant New England culture in the midwest Dunbar High School issued a handbook on behavior to its students that spelled out how one should act not only in the school but in the world at large64 The values and deportment these students were taught would today be called by critics acting white   Nor did the difference in the way Dunbar students behaved go unnoticed in the local black community Dunbar High School became so controversial among blacks in Washington that the late Pulitzer Prizewinning Washington Post columnist William Raspberry said that you could turn any social gathering of the citys middleaged blacks into warring factions by simply saying the one word Dunbar65 Resentments of Dunbar High School in Washingtons black community were as common as resentments of New Yorks elite public high schools and resentments of other high achievers in other countries around the world   The clash between proud alumni of Dunbar and other blacks antagonistic to the school became so bitter that a controversy over what to do with the original Dunbar High School building after a more modern building was built to replace it became literally a federal case that went up to the US Circuit Court of Appeals When the issue was first raised in Washingtons City Council one member of that Council said There are people in this city who say that the school represents a symbol of an litism among blacks that should never happen again I say we should raze it66 After the Dunbar alumni lost in the courts the original Dunbar High School building was demolished It was one of many triumphs of the ghetto culture across the country in the second half of the twentieth century with consequences that spread far beyond educational institutions   The changing social climate of the 1960s and beyond included a celebration of the ghetto culture essentially an offshoot of the dysfunctional redneck culture of the South67 though often regarded    Social Factors 115    Socalled black English for example has no connection with languages in Africa but very strong connections with the way English was spoken centuries ago in the parts of Britain from which white Southerners came See for example David Hackett Fischer Albions Seed Four British Folkways in America New York Oxford University Press 1989 pp 256258  as something uniquely black or even African despite much evidence to the contrary So pervasive did the influence of this ghetto culture become that even middleclass black youngsters felt a need to adopt attitudes values and behavior from that ghetto culture as a sign of racial solidarity or a need to avoid the stigma of acting white and the social consequences which could follow ranging from ridicule to ostracism to threats and outright violence   Legendary basketball star Kareem AbdulJabbar described what it was like for him as a youngster growing up in this culture  I got all As and was hated for it I spoke correctly and was called a punk I had to learn a new language simply to be able to deal with the threats I had good manners and was a good little boy and paid for it with my hide68  None of this was unique to a particular individual or a particular place It was a growing influence among blacks across the country A study of black youngsters in the racially mixed affluent suburb of Shaker Heights Ohio found these youngsters far behind their white peers academically Nor was the reason mysterious Black students spent far less time studying and far more time watching television or engaging in other activities69 Nor was this simple laziness There was an actual aversion to behaviors regarded as acting white According to the researcher who studied these black students The White behavior most often singled out for criticism was talking proper70 In other words speaking standard English was seen as a racial betrayal  What amazed me the researcher said is that these kids who come from homes of doctors and lawyers are not thinking like their parents they dont know how their parents made it Instead they are looking at rappers in ghettos as their role models they are looking at entertainers71 The normal incentives against shortsighted young people throwing away their education and thus in many cases their    chance for a decent life are greatly reduced when schools promote them to the next grade whether they have learned what they were supposed to have learned or not When asked why they were not taking their school work seriously many black students in Shaker Heights said that they knew they were going to be promoted to the next grade anyway72 What lay ahead of them in life after they finished school was apparently beyond their time horizon  School teachers and administrators were not the only adults reducing the incentives for black youngsters to take school work seriously Many black leaders and spokesmen like leaders and spokesmen for other lagging racial or ethnic groups in various other countries depict their groups problems as primarily or solely due to other people and depict opposing those other groups and their culture as the way to advance Moreover many among the intelligentsia and in educational institutions go along in the spirit of helping blacks One of the black leaders who rejected this approach was Martin Luther King Jr He said We cant keep on blaming the white man There are things we must do for ourselves73 But that has not been the prevailing view  It is not just in elite schools that we can see educational retrogression among black youngsters We have grown so used to seeing ghetto schools lag far behind other schools that it may be surprising for some to learn that this was not always the case As of 1941 for example test scores in a sample of classes in Harlem elementary schools were very similar to test scores in a sample of classes in the same grades in white schools in working class neighborhoods on New Yorks Lower East Side   In April of that year there were some questions on which sixth grade classes in some Harlem schools did marginally better than sixth grade classes in the white schools on the Lower East Side while on other questions these white sixth graders did marginally better than their counterparts in Harlem The same was true of third grade classes in the two neighborhoods in May 1947 December 1941 saw all sixth grade classes in the sample of Harlem schools do marginally better than sixth grade classes in the sample of Lower East Side schools on  116 Wealth Poverty and Politics    all the questions February 1951 saw a class in a junior high school on the Lower East Side do marginally better than the average of an all male and an allfemale junior high school in Harlem74  In short there were no serious differences in test results in these samples of Harlem schools and Lower East Side schools These were all just ordinary workingclass neighborhood schools with no real difference in educational results between those schools that were black and those that were white  The educational retrogression to the situation today seems far more explicable by cultural retrogressions in the intervening years than by alternative theories of either heredity or environment when environment is defined as surrounding socioeconomic conditions as distinguished from including internal changes in cultural values Other social retrogressions over the same years include changes from an era when most black children were raised in twoparent homes to an era when the vast majority were not   It should also be noted that despite the prevalence of poverty in many black communities the poverty rate among black married couples has been in single digits every year since 199475 In other words those blacks whose behavior put them outside the pattern of the spreading ghetto culture escaped poverty to a far greater extent than other blacks  Culture matters The ghetto culture was not new but it had not spread so much to other parts of the black community before the second half of the twentieth century when it became widely celebrated especially by both the black and the white intelligentsia  Colleges and Universities At the college level egalitarian and demographic diversity  criteria have triumphed in admissions policies and practices even at elite institutions so the question is how this has affected the outcomes for black and Hispanic students in college and beyond Affirmative action policies can ensure that there are more minority students on  Social Factors 117    campus but these policies cannot ensure that they will graduate much less graduate in challenging subjects like mathematics science and engineering   Despite rising numbers of black students admitted to the University of California at Berkeley during the 1980s the number of black students graduating actually declined76 Conversely when a ban on affirmative action in admissions to the University of California system was imposed in the following decade the number of black students declined slightly in the system as a whole but the number of black students graduating increased The number of Hispanic students who graduated also rose substantially77 now that minority students were being admitted to those campuses of the University of California system that matched their academic qualifications rather than being mismatched with Berkeley or UCLA for the sake of demographic representation  In the wake of the ban on affirmative action the number of black and Hispanic students who graduated in four years rose 55 percent those who graduated with degrees in science technology engineering and mathematics rose by 51 percent and those who graduated with grade point averages of 35 or higher rose by 63 percent These results confirmed what many critics of affirmative action in academia had long said the students mismatched with institutions whose standards they did not meet would either fail to graduate as often as others or would manage to graduate only by avoiding difficult subjects like science technology engineering and mathematics  A widely acclaimed attempt to say that affirmative action was successful The Shape of the River by former college presidents William Bowen and Derek Bok had crucial defects  1 Although the study purported to show that blacks admitted under affirmative action policies with lower academic qualifications did well the actual samples in the statistics lumped together all black students those who were admitted with the same qualifications  118 Wealth Poverty and Politics    Social Factors 119  as other students and those admitted under affirmative action with lower qualifications than the other students78 The absence of data on the group specifically at issue those particular black students who were admitted with lower qualifications makes that study the statistical equivalent of Hamlet without the prince of Denmark  2 Despite Bowens and Boks apparently triumphant finding that black students in their sample graduated at higher rates the more selective the school that they attended79 that is not the mismatch hypothesis being tested The mismatch hypothesis says that the larger the differential in academic qualifications between black and white students at a given institution the larger the racial differential in failure to graduate tends to be  When this hypothesis is tested at specific individual institutions as was done in the Thernstroms America in Black and White rather than in aggregations of institutions from different SAT levels as in The Shape of the River the mismatch hypothesis is confirmed  Both studies use combined SAT scores as the measure of academic qualification The data in America in Black and White show that the difference between the combined SAT scores of black students and other students at Harvard for example was 95 points 1305 versus 1400 while the difference at Rice University was 271 points Correspondingly the racial difference in dropout rates was 2 percentage points at Harvard and 15 percentage points at Rice80 In the BowenBok aggregations Rice is included in an aggregation that also includes Princeton81 which has a much smaller racial differential in SAT scores than at Rice and a correspondingly smaller racial differential in dropout    rates namely 4 percentage points while Harvard is omitted from this selection of schools with top SAT scores Thus confirmations of the mismatch hypothesis within the same category of institutions vanish from view when the focus is on comparisons of different aggregations Statistical wonders can be performed with aggregations but these wonders do not necessarily stand up when individual institutions are examined Data from other studies of individual institutions show results very similar to those in America in Black and White and very different from those in The Shape of the River82  3 Other researchers were denied access to the raw data from which Bowen and Bok derived their conclusions83  The acclaim for the Bowen and Bok book may have had more to do with how welcome its conclusions were in many quarters rather than the quality of its evidence or logic What they said fit the prevailing vision which was apparently enough to exempt their conclusions from the further requirement of fitting the facts  Innate Potential Developed mental capabilities are not only more readily measured  but are more demonstrably important than innate mental potential Indeed the significance of innate potential derives largely from whatever role it might have as a source of or limitation on developed mental capabilities Whether we are choosing a plumber or a surgeon what we most want to know is that individuals skill at plumbing or surgery not whether that skill was due to heredity or environment  In the heyday of genetic determinism in the early twentieth century it was widely assumed by genetic determinists that genetic potential put a ceiling on the mental capabilities that could be  120 Wealth Poverty and Politics    developed in some racial or ethnic groups Because members of some groups were deemed to be intellectually capable of being no more than the proverbial hewers of wood and drawers of water genetic determinists supported eugenics a term coined by Francis Galton who advocated the gradual extinction of an inferior race84  The eugenics movement spanned the Atlantic Perhaps even more remarkably it spanned the ideological spectrum from conservatives like Winston Churchill and Neville Chamberlain to people on the left like John Maynard Keynes and leading Fabian socialists in England while a similar sweep in the United States ranged from socialist Jack London to conservative icon Henry L Mencken   Many American writings by genetic determinists of that era sought to show that Eastern Europeans and Southern Europeans were innately inferior intellectually to Northern Europeans85 This was an era when mass immigration from Europe to America had shifted from the Northern regions of Europe to its Eastern and Southern regions provoking fears that intellectually inferior and culturally unassimilable immigrants were flooding into the United States Belief in the innate inferiority of blacks was already so widespread and so deeply believed that literature on this subject was not comparably large   Later empirical evidence undermined the conclusions drawn at the peak of the ascendancy of genetic determinism As noted earlier Jews began to score above the national average on mental tests for example86 leading to mental test pioneer Carl Brighams recantation of his earlier views87 Others brought out the fact that white soldiers from several Southern states scored lower on the Armys mental tests than black soldiers from several Northern states88 undermining the most widely accepted racial version of genetic determinism   Not only did such results undermine the theory of a genetic basis for blackwhite differences in performances on mental tests these results were also inconsistent with the presumed innate mental superiority of Northern Europeans to Southern Europeans since the American South was settled primarily by the supposedly superior  Social Factors 121    Northern European population from Britain while the massive immigration from Eastern Europe and Southern Europe settled primarily outside the South   A closer examination of the performances of black soldiers on mental tests during the First World War raises questions about their cultural level at that time just as cultural questions were raised when Carl Brigham reexamined his conclusions about white immigrants who had been raised in homes where English was not the language spoken  For blacks who took the Army tests their very low level of literacy at that time was likewise a factor to be considered though few commentators took that into account One sign of the effect of the low level of literacy among black soldiers taking the Army mental tests and how that could affect the results was that a larger proportion of black soldiers were able to answer some of the more difficult test questions that did not require understanding the meaning of written words than were able to answer much simpler questions that did  In many parts of the Army Alpha test used during the First World War the modal score of black soldiers was zero derived by subtracting incorrect answers from correct answers in order to neutralize the effect of guessing These results were despite the fact that the actual intellectual substance of some of these questions involved only knowing that yes and no were opposites as were night and day bitter and sweet and other similarly extremely easy questions questions too simple to be missed by anyone who knew what the word opposite meant  In the Army Beta test given to soldiers who could not read some of the questions involved looking at pictures of a pile of blocks and  122 Wealth Poverty and Politics    The lower mental test scores of Southern whites are consistent with the fact that many if not most white Southerners emigrated from culturally isolated regions of Britain before those regions were incorporated into the mainstream culture of the country and before the spectacular rise of Scotland to the forefront of achievements after having been what historian Henry Buckle called poor and ignorant people See Grady McWhiney Cracker Culture Celtic Ways in the Old South Tuscaloosa University of Alabama Press 1988 p 56    determining how many blocks there were including blocks that were not visible but whose presence had to be inferred and counted from the shape of the piles Yet fewer than half of the illiterate black soldiers who took the Armys Beta test received a score of zero on such questions which were more intellectually demanding but did not require the ability to understand written words like opposite or written directions that may have been challenging to literate black soldiers whose literacy might have been very thin during that era when many blacks had very little education either quantitatively or qualitatively in inferior Southern schools  Given the very small quantity and low quality of education received by that generation of blacks even those who were technically literate were unlikely to have a substantial vocabulary of written words So it is hardly surprising that the completely illiterate black soldiers did better on substantively more challenging questions than blacks with some ability to read did on simpler questions89  Decades later the research of Professor James R Flynn an American expatriate in New Zealand brought out the fact that the raw scores on IQ tests had risen in a generation or two by a standard deviation or more in more than a dozen countries90 calling into question the belief that scores on these tests measured some fixed genetic endowment   The repeated renorming of IQ tests in order to maintain the definitional average IQ at 100 while the number of questions answered correctly changed had previously concealed this huge rise in the raw scores on IQ tests These rises in raw scores included the raw scores of black Americans whose IQs had remained at about 85 over the years as the tests were renormed But the average number of questions answered correctly on IQ tests by blacks in 2002 would have given them an average IQ of 104 by the norms used in 19471948 which is to say slightly higher than the average performance of Americans in general during the earlier period91  Whether or to what extent existing gaps in IQ are due to heredity is by no means a settled issue But even with something that is  Social Factors 123    generally agreed to be determined primarily by heredity such as height that does not mean that all existing differences in height are due to heredity much less that heights cannot vary for other reasons besides heredity in particular cases or change over time  The average height of Britons for example was once greater than the average height of the French as far back as the early eighteenth century and continuing on into the twentieth century However after 1967 the average height of the French equaled the average height of Britons92 While the gap in height between the British and the French closed a gap between the heights of North Koreans and South Koreans opened up after the country was partitioned following the Second World War93 with people in North Korea living under a draconian dictatorship that kept them povertystricken and illfed In Holland the average height of young males increased from 5 feet 4 inches to 6 feet between the middle of the nineteenth century and the early twentyfirst century94  Even in the absence of these various empirical findings the theories of genetic determinism that prevailed in the early twentieth century suffered from the relatively narrow slice of the millennia of human history from which they generalized The recurring theme in discussions of American immigration laws during that era was that immigrants from Southern Europe were mentally inferior to those from Northern Europe inferior not just in education or various other contemporary accomplishments but innately genetically and permanently inferior95  In the past few centuries Northern Europe has in fact outperformed Southern Europe in many ways in its economies in science and in technology for example But in ancient times Southern Europe outperformed Northern Europe by a far wider margin and there is no indication that the genes of people in either part of Europe changed Meanwhile China over the centuries lost its once commanding lead over all the Europeans and over Japan which much later overtook China again without any indication that genes had changed in any of these races   124 Wealth Poverty and Politics    Looked at another way strongly similar economic and social patterns have been found among people in certain geographic settings such as mountain communities in various parts of the world which is to say among people of different races with no genetic connection to one another Believers in genetic determinism will have to explain not only the coincidence of such nongenetically based similarities among these groups but also why persistently lagging groups from Canary Islanders in the past to various sub Saharan Africans to Australian aborigines have shared an unusually severe degree of isolation   There have been not only individual whites but whole communities of whites who scored at the same average IQ level as American blacks or lower The national average is itself an amalgam of very different IQs among groups as well as individuals so that comparison of any given group with the national average can suggest a uniqueness that is simply not there During the era of mass immigration to America from Europe immigrants from Spain Italy Greece Portugal and Poland scored at or below the IQs of American blacks96 Other groups of whites with average IQs no higher than those of blacks have included white mountaineer communities in the United States canal boat people in Britain and the Gaelicspeaking inhabitants of the Hebrides Islands off Scotland97  In short genes are neither necessary nor sufficient to explain most of the social patterns of disparate achievements that genetic determinists tried to explain However important genetics may be in a medical or other scientific context the relative influence of heredity and environment on the intelligence of different races remains an unresolved issue   Even if we were to accept IQ tests as a universally valid measure of intelligence for the sake of argument the existing range of IQ scores among blacks goes far above the average IQ of whites even though whites as a group have higher average IQs than blacks as a group The eugenics agenda of the genetic determinists in the early twentieth century seemed to be based on an implicit assumption that there was  Social Factors 125    a ceiling on the intelligence of particular racial or ethnic groups not simply that the average of their intelligence was lower at a particular time or place   Groups with identical ranges of innate intellectual potential can still end up with different averages if environmental circumstances cause different rates of reproduction or survival in various segments of their respective populations In other words environments can change the statistical average of IQs even if the range of IQs remains unchanged It has been suggested for example that the failure to reconsider current welfare policies that may be promoting a higher rate of reproduction of lower classes within the black community may be our societys greatest injustice to the black population It was pointed out that threefourths of the blacks who failed mental tests given by the armed forces come from families of four or more children98  Few American professional families of any race have four or more children which may be more common among unwed teenage mothers who are high school dropouts for whom the children are their meal ticket in a world with very few better options for them by the time they have frittered away their educational opportunities To have the proportion of the black population that is born to unwed teenage dropouts artificially increased by government policies is hardly a benefit to either the black population or to the society at large  The backlash against genetic determinism in later years has produced social philosophies lacking even as much evidence as the genetic determinists had Multiculturalists today decry any recognition that some peoples have superior achievements or inferior achievements at a given time and place though it is blatantly clear that Greeks were far more advanced than Britons in ancient times and Britons were more advanced than Greeks in the nineteenth century Today tests that show some groups far better at some things than other groups are often dismissed as biased tests Apparently according to that view some groups cannot possibly be better or worse than other groups at a given time or place or at least we cannot publicly admit it   126 Wealth Poverty and Politics    Such reactions or overreactions to genetic determinism can be especially harmful to groups that are lagging since it turns their attention and energies away from the many available ways in which they can improve themselves and their prospects as other lagging groups have done before them sometimes rising dramatically and instead leads them into the blind alley of resentments and lashing out at others  Social Factors 127    Chapter 5  POLITICAL  FACTORS  The worst political blunder in the history of civilization was probably the decision of the emperor of China in the year 1433 to stop exploring the oceans and to destroy the ships capable of exploration and the written records of their voyages   The decision was the result of powerful people pursuing partisan squabbles and neglecting the long range interests of the empire This is a disease to which governments of all kinds including democracies are fatally susceptible  Freeman Dyson1  In addition to the influence of such longrun or general factors asgeography and culture particular economic and other social outcomes can be influenced or even determined by particular individual happenstances at particular junctures in history The decision of the fifteenth century emperor of China to isolate his country from the outside world was just one of those fateful political decisions with unforeseen repercussions that changed the course of history for a whole civilization Such happenstances cut across such general influences as geography or culture preventing either geographic determinism or cultural determinism  128    The decision of the Spanish government to finance Columbus voyage across the Atlantic in search of an alternate route to India obviously changed the course of history for the entire Western Hemisphere and to a considerable extent for Europe as well Had the Japanese government not made the fateful decision to bomb Pearl Harbor Japan today might be a very different country without the fundamental and enduring social and institutional changes that took place during the years of American occupation after Japans defeat in the Second World War  Sometimes the happenstance that changes the course of history is not a conscious decision but the unpredictable outcome of a crucial military battle between closely matched armies on a chaotic battlefield where victory could easily have gone to either side Such was the battle of Waterloo in 1815 which the victor the Duke of Wellington afterwards called a near run thing But his victory over Napoleon determined the fate of generations yet unborn in countries across the continent of Europe   Had Hitler not been a fanatical antiSemite at a time when many of the worlds leading nuclear physicists were Jewish the United States might not have become the first nation with a nuclear bomb as a result of the Manhattan Project which was created in response to the initiative of Jewish physicists who had fled to America to escape mortal dangers in Europe  Whatever the geographic cultural or other influences in a given society they are all ultimately constrained by power whether governmental power or military power The Roman Empire was destroyed by barbarians setting back the economic cultural and technological level of Western Europe for centuries It has been estimated that a thousand years passed before Western Europe regained the standard of living it once had back in the days of the Roman Empire2  Political factors affecting the economic level of nations include both the presence and the effectiveness of government as an institution as well as the particular policies of particular governments  Political Factors 129    We take national governments so much for granted today that it is easy to forget how long it took for ancient village clan or tribal societies to coalesce into successively larger groupings over the millennia until eventually such entities as Greece China or France could emerge on the world stage   Although China emerged in what are from our perspective today ancient times this emergence of nations in general began like most of what we recognize as civilization in a late and small fraction of the existence of the human species Moreover the emergence of nations was not the same everywhere either in timing or completeness We need to consider the process by which nations have emerged and the economic and social consequences of differences in the pace and completeness of that political process among different peoples in different places and times  THE  EMERGENCE  OF  NATIONS  There was a China many centuries before there was a Britain or France and these European nations in turn predated the United States by centuries Moreover the process of forming nations has by no means been irreversible Not only was Carthage obliterated by the Romans Poland was just one of the many nations swallowed up by larger empires and one of the few that was later reconstituted after the breakup of dynastic empires in Europe and the Middle East in the wake of the First World War  The incentives for moving beyond the ancient bands of hunter gatherers and forming successively larger political units over the millennia were both political and economic Larger governing units usually mean more powerful units protecting the society or advancing its interests Larger political units also offer economic benefits Tribes or villages can seldom if ever produce and sell in a large enough volume to reap the full benefits of lower costs per unit which result from specialization and economies of scale that mass production firms  130 Wealth Poverty and Politics    and industries reap if they have a large enough market for a vast outpouring of their products  Cities may be able to reap some of the benefits of specialization when there has been a large enough local market for the resulting product so that specialized workers are able to devote themselves fulltime to producing one particular product or engaging in one particular process such as printing or weaving But cities have usually been way stations on the road to the creation of nations though there are still a few citystates even today such as Singapore or Monaco  The economic and social benefits of larger societies do not ensure that such societies will emerge everywhere In some places and times the spontaneous coalescing of smaller groupings into successively larger groupings has lagged so far behind the pace of the same process in other contemporary societies that people living in small and vulnerable societies have been simply conquered or enslaved by larger and more powerful societies   Among the reasons why some societies coalesce into larger political units at different paces is that some societies are more in communication and interaction with other societies with greater frequency or over wider areas so that their peoples and rulers can come to know and work with other peoples and rulers over long periods of time slowly resolving their differences through trial and error and gradually building up ties that create mutual benefits which all have incentives to preserve and expand  This process however may be much slower or even nonexistent in regions fragmented geographically as in the Balkan mountains or on small islands scattered across a vast sea or in much of subSaharan Africa with its many limitations on communication and transportation Peoples in such isolated places have usually been slow to create nations on a scale like that of ancient China or the Roman Empire or even on a scale like that of modestsized nations like Italy or Thailand  The radius of trust can be a major factor in the pace and extent to which small social groupings coalesce into successively larger political units just as it has been a factor in creating larger economic units  Political Factors 131    Small mountain communities for example have been especially slow to coalesce into larger governmental units As one geographic study put it Political solidarity has a hard slow birth in the mountains because of various forces working against political consolidation3  These forces working against consolidation into larger political units include a multiplicity of languages and dialects among fragmented mountain populations4 impeding even simple communication Clan tribal and religious differences have likewise fragmented mountain populations along with the geographic isolation of mountain communities from one another whether with or without cultural contrasts among the different settlements The limited economic benefits of cooperation between very poor mountain communities can also mean reduced incentives to consolidate There is not the same reward for cooperation or consolidation as in richer places especially those with contrasting skills and very different natural resources such as make trade beneficial to all the parties involved  Family and tribal feuds have long been common among mountain peoples around the world5 whether in the mountains of Taiwan or Afghanistan or in Americas Appalachian Mountains The geographic fragmentation of mountain peoples has been an obstacle to developing a wider radius of trust or even a wider radius of toleration Among the consequences of such social fragmentation of populations have been minute mountain states and dwarf republics in the words of a noted geographer6  Even where there are formally speaking large mountain nations such as Afghanistan these are not necessarily nations whose national governments actually have effective control over all the territory they nominally govern More than a hundred years ago mountainous Afghanistan was described as a region with no sense of unity among its numerous tribes a situation which offers little hope of Afghanistan ever developing national cohesion7 Little that has happened in more than a century since then would contradict that assessment  132 Wealth Poverty and Politics    Political consolidation has sometimes been forced upon fragmented mountain peoples by foreign conquest or by the threat of such conquest which sometimes led to defensive alliances against that outside threat But these temporary alliances seldom led to permanent consolidations into nationhood   Switzerland has been a rare exception perhaps due to the many mountain passes into the Swiss Alps8 that kept the people in these mountains from being as isolated as peoples in many other mountains around the world while the large valleys in the Swiss Alps presented better opportunities for large settlements more in touch with each other and with the outside world9 The dearth of navigable waterways in other mountain regions is not the case in Switzerland which has such waterways as Lake Geneva and Lake Lucerne lakes as enclosed waterways being inherently navigable unlike rivers and streams that pour down steep mountain terrain  The empire of the Incas in the Andes Mountains of South America was another and even more striking exception to the small size of nations in mountainous terrain The Inca Empire covered 906000 square kilometers more than 20 times the size of Switzerland and roughly the size of France and Germany put together10 There were long and large valleys between the mountain ranges those valleys in the lower elevations being suitable for agriculture11 This created a very different geographic setting from those in other mountains where people are more fragmented geographically in small communities kept small by the very limited amount of arable land in many mountain valleys and by formidable geographic obstacles to communication and transportation  Unlike other mountains lacking major navigable waterways the Andes include Lake Titicaca more than 100 miles long more than 900 feet deep and with a surface area of more than 3000 square miles12 The peoples living around the enormous perimeter of this lake had ready communication with each other across a navigable waterway Lake Titicaca has been called the cradle of the Inca Empire13 and its capital Cuzco was situated between two rivers  Political Factors 133    The presence of vast numbers of llamas in some of the mountain valleys of the Andes gave the Incas small but numerous pack animals that were lacking elsewhere in the Western Hemisphere before Europeans arrived with their animals In these settings the Inca Empire began and later spread to other geographic settings in western South America for a distance of 4000 kilometers from north to south14  The imperative to produce specific crops at specific times of the year and to preserve the resulting food which peoples in temperate zone climates felt for millennia were in the Inca Empire challenges supplied by the peculiar climate of the region where that empire originated The unique situation of a vast and high mountain range located in the tropics gave the Incas a unique climate that was quite different from that common in either temperate or tropical zones This climate had a seasonality based on great differences in the amount of rainfall at different times of the year even though average daytime high temperatures ranged only from 68 degrees to 73 degrees in the Inca capital of Cuzco  This rainfall seasonality plus the vulnerability of crops to drought and hard frosts due to overnight temperatures that could fall to freezing levels during the winter as well as changing weather conditions from one year to the next created the same lifethreatening challenge faced for millennia by peoples located in the temperate zones The Incas met this challenge by creating large networks of food storage facilities scattered throughout their far flung empire and by developing ways of making some perishable foods storable15 Thus the geographic environment of the Incas produced the same necessity for developing selfdiscipline and human capital in general that peoples in the temperate zones had to create in order to survive The Inca Empire was not tropical in any meaningful climatic sense   Special local geographic conditions made Switzerland and the Inca Empire exceptions to the handicaps that kept the peoples in many other mountains poor backward and unable to create large well functioning political units However mountains are not the only geographic feature that can fragment a population and isolate the  134 Wealth Poverty and Politics    fragments from one another impeding the formation of nationstates Other geographically isolated and fragmented regions such as the Canary Islands and much of subSaharan Africa have likewise been culturally divided with far more different languages than among similar numbers of people living on a broad mainland in ready communication with each other   The Canary Islanders for example were not only poor and backward ignorant of iron and other metals when the Spaniards discovered them but were also speaking languages in some of these islands that were unintelligible to people on some other islands in the same group16 The peoples of subSaharan Africa produced iron more than a thousand years earlier but were likewise handicapped by a multiplicity of languages In those parts of subSaharan Africa with less severe geographical handicaps larger communities arose than in other parts of tropical Africa As in other regions of the world these larger and more advanced peoples in subSaharan Africa often conquered or enslaved their smaller or less advanced neighbors   In China one of the advantages of the written Chinese language is that it is a nonphonetic language so that peoples who cannot understand each others spoken languages or dialects can nevertheless communicate with each other in written Chinese From a political standpoint this can facilitate the consolidation of linguistically different peoples into a larger nation  Since power is inherently relative the ability of small political units to survive independently depends on the size and power of other political units within striking distance of them As already noted impediments to political consolidation have made small societies vulnerable to both conquest and enslavement Despite widespread misconceptions in the United States today that the institution of slavery was based on race for most of the thousands of years in which slavery existed around the world it was based on whoever was vulnerable to enslavement and within striking distance   Thus Europeans enslaved other Europeans just as Asians enslaved other Asians and Africans enslaved other Africans while Polynesians  Political Factors 135    enslaved other Polynesians and the indigenous peoples of the Western Hemisphere enslaved other indigenous peoples of the Western Hemisphere The very word slave derived from the word for Slavs who were enslaved by fellow Europeans for centuries before Africans began to be brought in chains to the Western Hemisphere17  Africans were not singled out by race for ownership by Europeans they were resorted to after the rise of nationstates with armies and navies in other parts of the world reduced the number of places that could be raided for slaves without great costs and risks Slaveraiding continued in Africa primarily by Africans enslaving other Africans and then in West Africa selling some of their slaves to whites to take to the Western Hemisphere Meanwhile the growing range of ships and the growing wealth of nations eventually made economically feasible the transportation of vast numbers of slaves from one continent to another creating racial differences between the enslaved and their owners as a dominant pattern in the Western Hemisphere  Such a pattern was by no means limited to Europeans owning nonEuropeans however There were many examples of the reverse quite aside from vast regions of the earth where neither the slaves nor their owners were either black or white   Unprotected coastal settlements in Europe and European sailors at sea were long vulnerable to slave raids by pirates from the Barbary Coast of North Africa These pirates enslaved at least a million Europeans between 1500 and 180018 That is more than the number of African slaves transported to the United States and to the American colonies from which it was formed19 The Ottoman Empire set a levy of a certain percentage of young boys from the conquered peoples in Southeastern Europe these boys being taken away as slaves converted to Islam trained and assigned civil and military duties in the empire20 Nor were these the only white slaves in the Ottoman Empire Among others Circassian women from the Caucasus region were highly prized as concubines by wealthy men in the Ottoman Empire and such positions were sufficiently prized by Circassians that mothers groomed their daughters for such roles21  136 Wealth Poverty and Politics    The slow pace of political consolidation in much of subSaharan Africa left many small and vulnerable societies there whose people were raided and enslaved largely by other Africans from more geographically favored settings coastal peoples enslaving less advanced and less consolidated inland peoples for example22 It was from the coastal peoples of West Africa that whites purchased slaves for shipment to the Western Hemisphere23 In East Africa both Africans and Arabs raided the more vulnerable tribes and enslaved them24  Conquest was another fate of smaller or less powerful peoples in countries around the world One of the consequences of imperialism whether ancient or modern has been that an empire can combine peoples into larger governmental units than the conquered peoples ever combined into themselves Thus the Roman Empire for example combined independent tribes in ancient Britain into Roman Britain within a government that covered a great part of the island Then when the Romans withdrew four centuries later to go defend the empire that was under attack on the continent of Europe Britain fragmented into tribal areas again and retrogressed economically   This pattern would be repeated more than a thousand years later when European imperialism in Asia and Africa collapsed after the Second World War In Nigeria for example the HausaFulani tribes of the north had never been combined in the same country with the Ibos Yorubas and various other tribes in other parts of the country before the British began taking over that region of Africa in the late nineteenth century and named it Nigeria   After the British pulled out in 1960 independent Nigeria was repeatedly racked by intertribal mob violence a ghastly civil war and a series of military coups and countercoups all of these reflecting tribal hostilities in a country the indigenous peoples never created but where they were thrown together under outside imperial rule This pattern of postindependence polarization and violence was not unique to Nigeria As the international treatise Ethnic Groups in Conflict by Donald L Horowitz put it In a large number of ex colonial states the independence rally gave way to the ethnic riot25  Political Factors 137    Geographically Nigeria has been one of the more fortunate regions of subSaharan Africa Watered by the great Niger River and its principal tributary the Benue and blessed with natural resources including iron ore and large petroleum deposits the peoples of that region had produced iron centuries before the Christian era and had developed their own cities and countries before the British arrived but nothing on the scale of the Nigeria that the British created with its tribal antagonisms that had never been resolved but only suppressed under British rule According to Professor Horowitzs treatise  What the colonialists did that was truly profound and far more important for ethnicity was to change the scale of the polity by several fold The colonies were artificial not because their borders were indifferent to their ethnic composition but because they were on the average many times larger than the political systems they displaced or encapsulated26  Like Roman Britain more than a thousand years earlier Nigeria was an artificial creation of the conquerors and its prosperity and viability were in jeopardy once the conquerors pulled out Nigeria has managed to remain one country but one of the poorest and most turbulent countries in the world That this is more a product of political factors than of either geographic handicaps or inherent deficiencies of its people is suggested by the fact that Nigerians living in the United States have had an impressive record of success  In 2010 there were some 260000 Nigerians in the US a mere 07 percent of the black American population Yet in 2013 20 to 25 percent of the 120 black students at Harvard Business School were Nigerian As early as 1999 Nigerians were overrepresented among black students at elite American colleges and universities by a factor of about ten27  Nearly onefourth of Nigerian households in the United States have incomes of more than 10000028 With all due allowance for the fact that immigrants may be different from the people left behind the contrast between the way Nigerians progress under American institutions and the way they fail to make comparable progress under the institutions in their homeland is much like the way the overseas  138 Wealth Poverty and Politics    Chinese and the overseas Indians long progressed far better outside their respective homelands This suggests that there may well be similar reasons that the political structures and practices in Nigeria may be a major handicap that nullifies the potential of both its people and its geographic setting  In Asia British India was a similar story on a larger scale The extremely heterogeneous peoples living on the Indian subcontinent were lumped together by their conquerors for their conquerors convenience but without the indigenous peoples having resolved their differences and coalesced voluntarily over time into this political entity After the British pulled out in 1947 the carnage was even greater than in Nigeria The number of people killed in the 1947 mob violence between Hindus and Muslims has been estimated in the vicinity of a million as British India split into a predominantly Hindu India and a predominantly Muslim Pakistan   Nevertheless despite this split aimed at reducing HinduMuslim conflict both India and Pakistan have subsequently been racked sporadically by internal conflicts between various groups with East Pakistan eventually breaking off to form the new nation of Bangladesh Overseas Indians like the overseas Chinese and like the Nigerians living in America have long prospered in many other countries around the world where they were free from the political and other constraints deficiencies and conflicts of their native land Despite the widespread poverty in India Americans of Indian ancestry have the highest incomes of any group tracked by the US Bureau of the Census29 Religious groups like Mormons and Jews are not tracked  Other multiethnic postcolonial nations that emerged after being freed by the breakup of empires have had similar internal turmoils Whether these nations subsequently split internally as happened with India Yugoslavia and Czechoslovakia or remained intact like Nigeria Sri Lanka and the Philippines their internal strife has taken its toll both economically and socially   While such historical patterns demonstrate once more the powerful negative force of isolation on economic and social development these  Political Factors 139    patterns also show why the transportation and communications revolutions of the past two centuries cannot undo the effects of earlier centuries or millennia of isolation Even if the transportation and communications revolutions were to become as complete in formerly isolated parts of the world as in other regions that have long had a wider cultural universe that cannot undo the fact that peoples living in a wider cultural universe have had centuries or millennia to become acquainted with other peoples and to work out cooperative relationships with them while those living in isolation have not   The fact that isolated peoples have usually been poorer and more backward has often meant that transportation and communications advances reached them belatedly and on a smaller scale A life changing advance like railroads for example reached parts of Eastern Europe and the Balkans only after trains had spread rapidly across Western Europe in the first half of the nineteenth century   As late as 1860 there was not a single mile of railroad track south of the Danube and the Sava rivers30 We have already noted that a train was a complete mystery to people in Japan in 1853 when that country was a poor and backward nation It was a quarter of a century later before the first railroad reached Serbia31 Meanwhile in the United States even the less industrialized South had a railroad hub in Atlanta which made it a target for General William T Shermans army in its devastating march through Georgia during the Civil War  The often tragic histories of the emergence of multiethnic nations created by imperial conquerors should call into question the extent to which nationbuilding by outsiders is a promising prospect It should also cause some second thoughts or perhaps first thoughts about the endlessly repeated mantra of ethnic diversity as such a source of societal strength that it is a compelling interest for government in the words of the Supreme Court of the United States32 Few words have been repeated so often or so insistently as diversity without a speck of evidence being offered or asked for to substantiate its claims of economic or social benefits And the evidence to the contrary is huge   140 Wealth Poverty and Politics    Seldom if ever do advocates of demographic diversity compare the actual empirical record of the costs and benefits of such diversity in countries around the world India with its vast array of ethnic linguistic caste and other subdivisions of its population should have great advantages over an extremely homogeneous society like Japan if diversity is such a benefit but there is little empirical evidence that this is so and much empirical evidence to the contrary In India as in a number of subSaharan nations there is no given language spoken by even half the population and mass intergroup violence has by no means been unusual   It is an important and commendable achievement for a nation to overcome problems common to multiethnic societies but that is very different from claiming that multiple ethnicities in a nation are automatically a net benefit A closer look at politically polarized multiethnic societies raises many painful questions This is nowhere more clearly or more distressingly apparent than in countries where one racial or ethnic group is strikingly more prosperous than others and where that fact is politicized  THE  POLITICS  OF  POLARIZATION  Disparities in income and wealth whether within nations or between nations can arise from many causes However the presumed causes that are politically popular have tended to be those which involve the less fortunate being victims of the more fortunate General causes such as geography demography and culture have no such political attraction as explanations despite whatever causal weight they may have in fact  It might seem as if every society whether rich or poor can always use greater productivity wherever it is available But it only seems that way Politically there is a major problem especially in a poor country when some racially or socially distinct group has markedly higher levels of skills or economic experience than that in the rest of the population   Political Factors 141    From an economic perspective this situation presents a valuable opportunity for the more productive portion of the population to supply much needed human capital to enable the economy as a whole to become more productive creating benefits for the population at large Moreover the presence of people with such human capital also presents an opportunity for individuals in the rest of a society to acquire some of this human capital themselves whether by example by working with or observing the more productive group or by studying to acquire such skills in educational institutions Knowledge is one of the few things that can be transferred to others without those from whom it is transferred having any less remaining for themselves  From a political perspective however the situation is entirely different As noted in Chapter 3 when more productive groups freely compete in a market economy this leads to visible disparities in economic outcomes that are resented by the less successful groups Political leaders in many lagging countries have been keenly aware of this prospect   A political leader of the Malays in Malaysia for example said candidly Whatever the Malays could do the Chinese could do better and more cheaply33 This provided a political rationale for imposing preferential policies for the benefit of the Malays which is to say discrimination against the Chinese in Malaysia This same political leader observed  These few Malays for they are still only very few have waxed rich not because of themselves but because of the policy of a Government supported by a huge majority of poor Malays It would seem that the efforts of the poor Malays have gone to enrich a select few of their own people The poor Malays themselves have not gained one iota But if these few Malays are not enriched the poor Malays will not gain either It is the Chinese who will continue to live in huge houses and regard the Malays as only fit to drive their cars With the existence of the few rich Malays at least the poor Malays can say that their fate is not entirely to serve rich nonMalays From the point of view of racial ego and this ego is still strong the unseemly existence of Malay tycoons is essential34  142 Wealth Poverty and Politics    Political Factors 143  What is involved in such reactions is not simply poverty or envy but resentment If the issue was envy then it would be hard to explain the pride that Malays have had in their own wealthy Malay sultans35 Sultans are in a much more enviable position than most Chinese in Malaysia The sultans are likely to be wealthier and their wealth has come by inheritance rather than by personal achievement But personal achievement is much more of a threat to the egos of others than inheritance is not only in Malaysia but elsewhere   In the United States for example three heirs to the Rockefeller fortune have been elected governors of three different states and two Roosevelts with inherited wealth have been elected President of the United States It is the Asian immigrants of a later time many of whom have been refugees who in many cases arrived on American shores with little money and a few words of broken English but who have worked their way up from the bottom to a modest prosperity and whose children excel in school and then head off to prestigious universities who are threats to the egos of lagging groups in America who have made nothing like the same use of their own opportunities  Korean immigrants to the United States for example worked an average of 63 hours per week as storekeepers in Atlanta with one fifth of them working 80 hours or more36 In New York Korean greengrocers have gone out to pick up their fruits and vegetables from wholesalers at 400 AM enabling them to select the best of these fruits and vegetables and to save on delivery charges that other greengrocers had to pay37  The children of such Asian families have shown a similar work ethic in school and have provoked the same resentments by their superior academic achievements as adult high achievers have provoked in members of lagging groups in countries around the world Children of Asian families have for years been beaten up by black classmates in the public schools of New York and Philadelphia38 with little or nothing being done by the authorities to stop it and no editorial indignation about it from people in the media who are quick to cry racism at any    passing remark that can be construed as critical of any of the groups currently in favor among the intelligentsia   Like the Asian immigrants to America today Jewish Lebanese and Japanese immigrants have at various times in the past arrived in various countries around the world with little money but much human capital and prospered as a result provoking resentments among those who were there before them and who made no similar use of their own opportunities There have also been examples of the same social phenomena among groups who migrated within their own country and rose to prosperity and who were likewise resented The Marwaris and Bengalis in various parts of India Armenians in the Ottoman Empire as well as Ibos in Nigeria and Tamils in Sri Lanka are among other examples of the same social phenomenon39  In many countries the political priority of protecting majority group egos has trumped the economic or other benefits of making use of the best skills and talents available in the economy After Nigeria became independent in 1960 a high political priority among the HausaFulani peoples in northern Nigeria was to get rid of the Ibos from southern Nigeria who had dominated professions and skilled occupations in northern Nigeria under British rule Ibos were driven out of northern Nigeria often to the accompaniment of lethal mob violence even when there were not enough qualified northern Nigerians to replace the Ibos and European expatriates had to be hired to take their place instead40  In the same vein when Romania acquired territory from the defeated Central Powers after the First World War this territory included universities that were culturally German or culturally Hungarian The Romanian government made it a political priority to force Germans and Hungarians out of these universities even though most Romanians were still illiterate at that point and so could not replace the Germans or Hungarians41 The expulsion of Asians from Uganda in the 1970s led to the collapse of the Ugandan economy because there were not nearly enough qualified Ugandans to replace them in the business sector that people from the Indian subcontinent had dominated for generations42  144 Wealth Poverty and Politics    These were not isolated examples Distinguished development economist Peter Bauer of the London School of Economics who studied Third World countries for years reported a general pattern in those countries of persecution of the most productive groups especially minorities and sometimes their expulsion43  However much productive minority groups might benefit a national economy in a poor country their marked success threatens the egos of the lagging majority provoking often bitter resentments In Bolivia a terrorist of indigenous descent when asked why he was engaging in terrorist activity replied So that my daughter will not have to be your maid44 When the new nation of Czechoslovakia was created out of the dissolution of the Habsburg Empire after the First World War one of the new Czech leaders first political priorities was preferential treatment of Czechs which meant discrimination against Germans setting in motion a series of major tragedies for both Czechs and Germans over the next three decades45  If poverty or envy were the fundamental problem then a more productive economy and a spreading of productive skills to those without them might seem to be the answer But neither of these things can cure resentments at being in a galling inferior position   For those seething with such resentments it is not sufficient to have a rising standard of living From the standpoint of resenters the priority is that those in a superior position must be brought down Even the killing of the more fortunate is often not considered sufficient They must be made to suffer both physical agonies and personal humiliations to bring them down to the level of those who attack them and below That has been a common pattern whether the targets of violent actions have been the Chinese in the Philippines Armenians in the Ottoman Empire Jews in Nazi Germany or Tutsis in Rwanda among others  The Chinese in the Philippines are among the many productive groups whose economic success has led to violent backlashes As an international study noted  Political Factors 145    146 Wealth Poverty and Politics  In the Philippines millions of Filipinos work for Chinese almost no Chinese work for Filipinos The Chinese dominate industry and commerce at every level of society Global markets intensify this dominance When foreign investors do business in the Philippines they deal almost exclusively with Chinese Apart from a handful of corrupt politicians and a few aristocratic Spanish mestizo families all of the Philippines billionaires are of Chinese descent By contrast all menial jobs in the Philippines are filled by Filipinos All peasants are Filipinos All domestic servants and squatters are Filipinos46  The same study also noted Hundreds of Chinese in the Philippines are kidnapped every year almost invariably by ethnic Filipinos Many victims often children are brutally murdered even after ransom is paid47  A study of the Ottoman Empire described the mass slaughters of Armenians by Turkish mobs in 1894 including bayoneting the men to death raping the women dashing their children against the rocks48 In 1915 there was a death march imposed on Armenians in which thousands perished many of the women were stripped naked and forced to walk into the city that way49  It was much the same pattern in Rwanda in the late twentieth century when the Hutus slaughtered hundreds of thousands of Tutsis Young children were often killed in front of their parents by cutting off one arm then the other A United Nations official reported They would then gash the neck with a machete to bleed the child slowly to death but while they were still alive they would cut off the private parts and throw them at the faces of the terrified parents who would then be murdered with slightly greater dispatch50   Such atrocities reflect vengeful resentments that cannot be assuaged by a higher Gross Domestic Product per capita The feelings behind ghastly acts of revenge are not simply envy but resentments lashing out at those whose success has inflicted a galling position of inferiority and wounded feelings of inferiority on those who resent  Yet it is also a puzzling and disturbing fact that some groups who inflicted horrific atrocities on others had previously coexisted peacefully for years or even generations with those who eventually became targets of their rage The Times of India for example referred to neighbours    Political Factors 147  leading longtime friends to gory deaths during intergroup outbreaks of violence in Mumbai Bombay in 1992199351  Such disturbing patterns not only raise sobering questions about how secure any apparent detente between racial or ethnic groups is in fact These patterns also suggest that some catalyst may be needed to arouse the feelings behind the horrors and of course no one can know in advance when any such catalyst may arise even in the most tranquil settings whether that catalyst appears in the form of a particular episode or a particular skilled and talented demagogue  When Sri Lanka achieved independence in 1948 its main ethnic groups were seen by observers both inside and outside the country as having good even cordial relations with one another52 There had been no riot between the Sinhalese majority and the Tamil minority during the previous halfcentury The educated and Westernized elites of both groups lived peacefully in the same Westernized residential enclaves   Nevertheless within a decade after Sri Lanka emerged from British rule as an independent nation in 1948 an ambitious politician named Solomon Bandaranaike seeking the prime ministership by turning the Sinhalese majority against the more prosperous Tamil minority set in motion group polarizations that escalated into mob violence and then a civil war that lasted a quarter of a century with unspeakable atrocities on both sides Bandaranaike was the catalyst Like many others who played that deadly role in other countries Bandaranaike was by no means one of the embittered poor himself He was from an elite background and was skilled in whipping up other peoples emotions for his own political purposes  Much discussion of policies toward Third World countries proceeds as if the fundamental problem in such countries is poverty    Once his purposes were served that is he became prime minister Bandaranaike was willing to back off the extremism he had aroused But the emotions he had whipped up could not be turned off and acquired a life of their own When Bandaranaike moderated his stance toward the Tamils after getting elected he was assassinated by a Buddhist extremist and the polarization process continued to escalate into a devastating civil war    and a lack of the skills and knowledge required to raise their standard of living Supplying money physical equipment and technocrats with skills might seem to be the answer as policies to help Third World countries advance But many if not most poor countries already have within their own borders people with the human capital to advance the nations economy Yet there are formidable political obstacles to using that human capital and many political incentives to avoid letting minorities with skills lacking in the majority population have free rein to put their skills to work with resulting disparities in performances and rewards  In the most varied conditions in countries around the world whether in Third World countries or in economically more advanced countries and whether in countries where the majority or the minority has the higher skills those seeking either the leadership or the votes of lagging groups tend to offer them four things  1 Assurance that their lags are not their fault 2 Assurance that their lags are the fault of some  advanced group that they already envy and resent 3 Assurance that the lagging group and their culture  are just as good as anybody elses if not better 4 Assurance that what the lagging group needs and  deserves is a demographically defined fair share of the economic and other benefits of society sometimes supplemented with some kind of reparations for past injustices or some special reward for being indigenous sons of the soil  Economic competition in the marketplace can financially punish people whose beliefs differ from reality but competition for votes at election time can politically punish people who assert a reality that differs from popular beliefs In addition racial or ethnic leaders have every incentive to promote the isolation of the groups they lead  148 Wealth Poverty and Politics    despite the fact that isolation has been a major factor in the poverty and backwardness of many different peoples around the world  Where a lagging group is concentrated in a particular region of a country leaders of such groups have incentives to promote secession from the more advanced part of the country as Slovaks seceded from Czechoslovakia and as East Pakistanis seceded from Pakistan to create the new nation of Bangladesh Despite the economic losses that poorer groups may sustain when they are no longer part of a more advanced economy their political leaders gain from acquiring more power as leaders of a nation and have every incentive to promote national pride in independent nationhood whether or not that has made the people they lead better off or worse off economically The people themselves may also benefit psychically by being spared the public embarrassment and private shame of being visibly outperformed repeatedly by others in the same economy and society  Where the political situation makes secession unlikely to happen leaders of lagging groups have every incentive to promote cultural isolation such as laws or policies in parts of the United States requiring the teaching of Hispanic children in the Spanish language even when their parents want them taught in English so as to facilitate their rise in the American economy and society53  Perhaps the most culturally isolated of all American ethnic groups are those descendants of the indigenous American Indian population who still live on reservations with great legal autonomy but with lower per capita incomes than blacks Hispanics or other American Indians who are not living on reservations Since the 1980s American Indians living off reservations who are a substantial majority of all American Indians have had per capita incomes slightly higher than those of Hispanic Americans while American Indians living on reservations have had substantially lower per capita incomes than black or Hispanic Americans and less than half that of the American population as a whole54 Yet leaders of American Indian reservations jealously guard their prerogatives and promote the perpetuation of separate cultures among the populations of these reservations   Political Factors 149    Racial or ethnic leaders also have incentives to blame advanced groups for the lags of lagging groups The behavior of advanced groups toward lagging groups has by no means always been exemplary nor necessarily even decent so the leaders of lagging groups may have many things to complain about without those things necessarily being the reasons for the economic educational or other gaps between the advanced groups and the lagging groups   In particular circumstances some advanced group may in fact be the cause of holding back some lagging group But that cannot be assumed a priori from the fact that one group is demonstrably more successful economically or in other ways Even where the advanced group has behaved badly toward the lagging group as has often happened in many countries around the world that is still not proof that the lagging group would have been better off economically in the absence of the advanced group   The ancient Romans certainly behaved abominably toward the ancient Britons whom they conquered But that is not to say that the Romans were the reason that the Britons lagged It was only the fact that the Britons lagged before the Romans arrived and conquered them that permitted a numerically smaller Roman military force to overwhelm a numerically larger British force both during the conquest and later when there was a mass uprising of the British provoked by the Romans oppression In putting down that uprising the Romans slaughtered Britons by the thousands and the queen who had led the uprising committed suicide to avoid the retribution she knew she could expect from the Romans Yet in modern times even such a British patriot as Winston Churchill could say We owe London to Rome55 because the ancient Britons were not yet capable of creating such a city themselves  No one believes that slaves were always treated well in the many times and places around the world where there were slaves There is too much documented evidence that they were not But the fact that black Americans today have a far higher standard of living than the peoples of subSaharan Africa from which they are descended is not  150 Wealth Poverty and Politics    a happenstance Nor can this outcome retroactively justify slavery any more than the valuable advantages that Western Europeans descendants received as a cultural legacy from Roman conquests can retroactively justify the Romans brutal oppression of their ancestors   Neither can individuals or groups lagging today automatically blame their lags on the injustices inflicted on their ancestors when the cultural benefits available to them in later times were an unintended byproduct of those injustices Moral condemnation is not causal explanation despite how often the two have been combined in a politically attractive package Despite the tendency of political and especially ideological explanations of economic disparities to combine moral and causal factors the reason so many mountain peoples around the world have been poor has not been that others went up into those mountains and took away their wealth but that the mountain peoples seldom produced much wealth in the first place The Spaniards seizing the wealth of the Incas was an exception on a horrific scale but empirically it was not the rule  The one thing that can be said unequivocally about the past is that it is irrevocable When both history and the contemporary world scene show what a challenge it can be to create or maintain decent relations among contemporaries it is staggering that some people imagine that they can take on the far larger task of righting the wrongs of the past committed by people long dead without igniting dangerous new hostilities among the living  THE  WELFARE  STATE   The welfare state is often seen in terms of its effects on the material wellbeing of individuals or groups However it can also have an effect on the productivity of a nation as a whole and therefore on the standard of living of its people in general Moreover the welfare states effects extend beyond economics to social behavior with major impacts on both the recipients of welfare benefits and those who  Political Factors 151    152 Wealth Poverty and Politics  interact with them These effects are not due solely to the welfare state as such but often to the social vision that accompanies the welfare state and changes the way many people see the world  The Welfare State Vision In a democratic country a welfare state can be created only after a  welfare state vision is created and prevails politically Therefore in assessing the effect of a welfare state we must include the effects of that vision as well as the effects of the particular institutions and policies created Among the assumptions behind the welfare state vision two seem crucial 1 many people are mired in a degree of poverty that a prosperous society can and should relieve and 2 many if not most of the people in poverty never had the same chance of a better life as others who ended up more prosperous   Even in a society with rules that are fair in the sense of judging everyone by the same standards and rewarding or punishing them according to the same criteria it would still be true that someone born in the South Bronx would have nothing like the same probability of achieving economic success however defined as someone born in an elegant Park Avenue neighborhood To be fair in the sense of providing equal probabilities of success for people born in unequal social circumstances would be very different In that sense life has been unfair in virtually every society of the past or the present   The case for the welfare state vision has seldom been made more clearly than by Nicholas Kristof of the New York Times  One delusion common among Americas successful people is that they triumphed just because of hard work and intelligence  In fact their big break came when they were conceived in middle class American families who loved them read them stories and nurtured them with Little League sports library cards and music lessons They were programmed for success by the time they were zygotes56  The social conditions into which individuals are born and raised are of course not equal just as the geographic demographic and    Political Factors 153  cultural conditions in which individuals groups and nations find themselves are not equal in their economic prospects This has been true throughout recorded history No doubt many of us wish that things were different and some want to do something about it But everything depends on just what specifically is the something that is done The welfare state is just one option among many  Mr Kristof s response to the unfairness of life is to criticize those who are oblivious of their own advantages and of other peoples disadvantages He accuses them of a meanspiritedness in the political world or at best a lack of empathy toward those struggling partly explaining the hostility to state expansion of Medicaid to long term unemployment benefits or to raising the minimum wage to keep up with inflation57 In short Kristof s response to the unfairness of life is a government transfer of resources from those who are more prosperous to those who are less prosperous with no caveats about the further consequences of such welfare state policies or its accompanying vision and no apparent apprehension about whether those consequences will make either the less prosperous or society at large better off or worse off on net balance  To blithely assume that the only reason to be against minimum wage laws is a lack of empathy with the poor is to ignore a vast literature on the negative repercussions of minimum wage laws These repercussions include increased numbers of unemployed young males idle on the streets which is seldom a benefit to any community   Ten years after passage of the federal minimum wage law in the United States the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938 the wartime inflation in the intervening years had so raised prices and wages that the minimum wage specified in that law was below what inexperienced and unskilled workers were already being paid so that by 1948 the economic situation in most places was the same as if there were no minimum wage law The unemployment rate among black 16 and 17yearolds that year was just under 10 percent But in later years as the minimum wage was repeatedly raised to keep up with inflation unemployment among blacks this age never again fell below    20 percent It was 27 percent a decade later in 1958 and 45 percent in 197558 It is one of the most elementary principles of economics that prices artificially raised above the level set by supply and demand creates unsaleable surpluses whether what is being sold is agricultural produce or labor regardless of the presence or absence of empathy  Despite a common claim advanced by Kristof among many others that Slavery and postslavery oppression left a legacy of broken families among blacks59 the plain fact is that the proportion of black children living with only one parent was never as large during the first hundred years after slavery as it became in the first thirty years after the great expansion of the welfare state beginning in the 1960s Yet the legacy of slavery argument continues to be blithely repeated and the legacy of the welfare state ignored  The proportion of black children being raised by a single mother in 1960 was 22 percent Thirtyfive years later that proportion had risen to 52 percent being raised by a mother alone 4 percent being raised by a father alone and another 11 percent being raised with neither parent present altogether 67 percent of all black children60 By 1995 the proportion of black children in povertylevel families who were being raised without a father present was 85 percent61  The central rationale for the welfare state is poverty But if the word is to have any specific meaning someone must define it in specific terms Once that is done poverty means no more and no less than those specifications however much the word may conjure up images from a past era when poverty meant hunger ragged clothing cramped housing and the like Today poverty in America means whatever government statisticians in Washington say it means and they are unlikely to define it in ways that would jeopardize the welfare state of which they are part  Most people living below the official poverty line in the United States in 2001 had central air conditioning and a microwave oven for example In fact these items were more common among the officially poor in 2001 than they were among the American population as a whole in 1980 Most povertylevel households in 2001 had cable  154 Wealth Poverty and Politics    television and two or more television sets As of 2003 nearly three fourths of officially povertylevel households owned at least one motor vehicle and 14 percent owned two or more62 In contrast to times past when lowincome people lived in overcrowded dwellings Americans living below the official poverty level today have more housing space per person than the average European not poor Europeans but the average European63 As a scholar who spent years studying Latin America put it the poverty line in the United States is the uppermiddle class in Mexico64  This is not to say that Americans living in official poverty have no problems They have serious and often catastrophic social problems but these are seldom the result of material deprivation and are far more often a result of social degeneration much of it representing social retrogressions during the era of the rising welfare state and of the pervasive nonjudgmental welfare state ideology  Progress and Retrogressions Black Americans a group often identified as beneficiaries of the  welfare state in America made considerable economic progress in the twentieth century but much if not most of it was prior to the massive expansion of the American welfare state beginning with the war on poverty programs of the 1960s   Progress for most blacks can be measured from the time of the Emancipation Proclamation of 1863 That progress was slow but steady By 1900 a majority of black Americans were literate something that would not be true of the population of Romania until decades later and of the population of India until more than half a century after that As of 1910 about onefourth of black farmers were owners or buyers of their land rather than renters or sharecroppers65 Herbert Gutmans monumental treatise The Black Family in Slavery and Freedom 17501925 showed that during the era from 1880 to 1925 the typical AfroAmerican family was lowerclass in status and headed by two parents In 1925 just 3 percent of black families in  Political Factors 155    New York were headed by a woman under thirty66 The unwed teenage mother became common in a later generation during the era of the expanded welfare state  The reasons for black poverty often very real poverty in earlier years especially are not hard to find It was 1930 before the average black adult had six years of education67 mostly in inferior Southern schools At that time only 19 percent of black children of high school age in the South actually went to high school68 It was 1924 before the first permanent public high school for black children was built in Atlanta69 after years of campaigns by the local black community  As of 1940 87 percent of black families in the United States lived below the poverty line But this declined to 47 percent by 1960 as black education and urban job experience increased in the wake of the mass migrations of blacks out of the South This 40 percentage point drop in the black poverty rate occurred prior to both the civil rights laws and the war on poverty social welfare programs of the 1960s Over the next 20 years from 1960 to 1980 the black poverty rate dropped an additional 18 points70 significant but the continuation of a pre existing trend at a slower pace rather than being a new result from new civil rights laws and welfare state policies as so often claimed  There were dramatic increases in the number of black elected officials in the South after passage of the Voting Rights Act of 1965 But nothing similarly dramatic occurred in black economic advancement as a result of the civil rights laws of the 1960s In some important social ways actual retrogressions set in  Arguably the most consequential of these social retrogressions was the decline in twoparent families We have also seen in Chapter 4 some declines in black educational achievements during this later era such as a decline in the proportion of black students in New Yorks Stuyvesant High School to onetenth of what they had been in earlier years In addition there was an increase in crime and violence including ghetto riots The first in a series of such riots across the country erupted in Los Angeles just days after the Voting Rights Act of 1965 was passed  156 Wealth Poverty and Politics    This eruption of violence was contrary to the prevailing political and social vision of the times in which problems among blacks were automatically assumed to be due to deficiencies in the way white people treated them But such riots were less common in the South71 where racial discrimination in laws and practices remained more common By contrast the worst of these riots with 43 people killed 33 of whom were black occurred in Detroit where the black unemployment rate was 34 percent and black home ownership was higher than in any other major city72 Yet no such facts made a dent in the prevailing social vision  The proliferation of black politicians and of community activists provided a great increase of leaders promoting the same kind of vision that ethnic leaders have promoted to many other lagging groups in many other countries around the world That vision is one in which the lagging groups problems are due primarily if not solely to the malign actions of other groups The answers offered to blacks in America have been in principle despite local variations very much like the answers offered to Czechs in nineteenth century Bohemia Sinhalese in twentieth century Sri Lanka Maoris in New Zealand and many others elsewhere group solidarity in pursuit of collective political solutions and in the meantime resistance to the cultures of those who are more fortunate   The actual track record of that approach as compared to other approaches used by other groups has received virtually no attention from either black leaders or the black or white intelligentsia in either the media or academia A list of groups that have risen from poverty to prosperity in countries around the world the Chinese Lebanese Jews and Japanese for example would usually also be a list of groups that played very little role in politics during their rise though a few of their members in later times could afford the luxury of political careers But even then those political careers were seldom based on being spokesmen for their respective groups in the political arena   Germans in Australia Brazil and the United States were long noted for their unusually low interest in politics while their interest in  Political Factors 157    education and in otherwise advancing themselves economically was the focus of their attention Even when some Americans of German ancestry became prominent in politics the Muhlenbergs in the eighteenth century Carl Schurz and John Peter Altgeld in the nineteenth century and Herbert Hoover and Dwight D Eisenhower in the twentieth century they did not do so as spokesmen for the German American community but as people addressing issues facing the American population as a whole In the period up through the First World War Germans in Brazil seldom bothered to vote73 Even when Germans were politically attacked as a group in nineteenth century Bohemia their first response was to defend a cosmopolitan outlook and only belatedly did they defend themselves specifically as Germans74  It was very much the same story with the overseas Chinese in Southeast Asia and the Western Hemisphere political apathy and fierce concentration on work education and saving The same unromantic but very effective concentration on work education and saving lifted Jewish Japanese and Lebanese immigrants from poverty to prosperity in various countries around the world It also lifted indigenous minorities like the Ibos in Nigeria Tamils in Sri Lanka and Armenians in the Ottoman Empire among others  Conversely one of the most politically successful groups in America the Irish did not rise from poverty as fast as other groups that were neither as involved politically nor as successful in politics as the Irish were Irish politicians reached influential positions in mid nineteenth century American cities and within a few decades the Irish were dominant in big city political machines in Boston New York and other cities across the country and remained so well into the twentieth century This brought prosperity prominence and power to a few but the great majority of the Irish continued to lag behind other Americans economically and even behind some other immigrant groups   At the beginning of the twentieth century 39 percent of the Irish in New York City were unskilled laborers the highest percentage for any ethnic group in New York at that time An additional 25 percent were classified as semiskilled75 At the same time 71 percent  158 Wealth Poverty and Politics    of firstgeneration Irish women in New York worked as domestic or personal servants as did 25 percent of secondgeneration Irish women76 As of 1930 the proportion of the Irish who paid more than a hundred dollars a month in rent was barely more than half the proportion among Russians most of whom were Jews during this era and less than half the proportion among Germans77 This was despite the fact that the peak of Irish immigration to America came decades before the peak of Jewish immigration so that the Irish had had a longer time to rise in American society   However plausible or even inspiring it might seem that a lagging minority needs to unite in solidarity behind political leaders representing their interests to the larger society in order to get ahead the historical record shows no such pattern of success for politics as compared to education job skills and intact families  Despite the ease with which some use the legacy of slavery argument to explain negative features of black communities today there is seldom any attempt to examine the facts as to whether whatever is complained of whether fatherless families crime rates or other social pathology was in fact worse in the first hundred years after slavery or in the first generation after the triumph of the welfare state vision in the 1960s The homicide fatality rate among nonwhites the vast majority of whom in this era were blacks killed by other blacks rose sharply during the 1960s after having declined substantially during the 1950s In 1950 the homicides per 100000 people were 455 among nonwhite males and this fell to 345 in 1960 followed by a rise to 608 in 197078  Other retrogressions followed in the wake of the disintegration of twoparent families These retrogressions included rising rates of welfare dependency79 unemployment80 crimes81 and organized mob violence against whites and Asians in dozens of cities and towns across the country82 While black civil rights organizations and the black public had long been opposed to racism nevertheless group identity politics eventually led to a situation in which a public opinion poll in 2013 found that more blacks saw their fellow blacks as racist than saw whites as racist83  Political Factors 159    During the first half of the twentieth century black migrants from the South were ridiculed by Northern blacks when they did not speak standard English or when their behavior in other respects betrayed a lower level of education or sophistication Black newspapers and black civic organizations like the Urban League tried to acculturate less educated lowerclass blacks to the norms of the larger society84 much as Irish and Jewish civic organizations during the immigrant era tried to acculturate their respective compatriots to the norms of the larger society85  In the second half of the twentieth century however with the spread of the nonjudgmental multicultural doctrine that all cultures are equally valid and equally deserved to be celebrated to repudiate the ghetto culture was now seen as a racial betrayal by blacks who were acting white Now even more educated and more acculturated blacks especially among the young felt a need to adopt or affect some patterns or norms from the ghetto culture as a sign of racial solidarity or at least to avoid social friction In short the acculturation process now reversed in favor of the lowest common denominator as the influence of the ghetto culture spread up the social scale leading to social retrogressions visible in many ways  Television documentaries about black communities in the first half of the twentieth century may show noticeably poorer neighborhoods than today with fewer cars parked on the streets but usually neighborhoods without graffiti or bars on windows Neither the residents of Harlem nor whites who visited Harlem faced the level of dangers in the first half of the twentieth century that became common and pervasive in Harlem and other black communities in later years  During the 1920s for example many white celebrities frequented Harlems entertainment centers and private parties into the wee hours of the morning before returning to their homes downtown often just before dawn Many had their own cars but music critic Carl Van Vechten a frequent visitor to Harlem simply went out on the streets often intoxicated to hail a cab to take him back to his west 55th Street apartment86 In the early 1930s when Milton Friedman  160 Wealth Poverty and Politics    was a graduate student at Columbia University he and his future wife went dancing at the Savoy Ballroom in Harlem with no fear of being mugged or accosted as he said in later years87 A black actress who lived in Harlem and performed in Manhattans midtown theater district during the 1940s said At one in the morning I would be taking the Eighth Avenue subway up getting off at the top of the Hill I had no fears whatsoever88 It is hard even to imagine such things in Harlem or other ghettos across the country today  Public housing projects were a particularly striking setting in which social retrogressions among blacks took place The filthy crimeridden violenceprone housing projects full of singleparent families on welfare that became common across the country in the second half of the twentieth century were by no means the norm during the first half of the twentieth century There were de facto racially segregated projects in both eras Yet the earlier projects were a striking contrast with the later projects during an era of non judgmental admissions policies toward applicants for apartments in the projects As the New York Times reported looking back on New Yorks earlier projects  These were not the projects of idle stinky elevators of gangcontrolled stairwells where drug deals go down In the 1940s 50s and 60s when most of the citys public housing was built a sense of pride and community permeated wellkept corridors apartments and grounds89  It was not simply the physical setting that was different So was the way of life in those early housing projects  Doors were kept unlocked as kids bounced from one apartment to the next on rainy Saturdays to watch Laurel and Hardy and Hopalong Cassidy on television90  This was an era when not everyone could afford a television set but when many people in the housing projects of that era who did have a television set felt safe enough to leave their apartment doors  Political Factors 161    unlocked on Saturday mornings so that their childrens friends could come visit to watch television with them   There was a similar atmosphere in Philadelphia housing projects of that era as described by black economist Walter Williams who grew up in a housing project there  Back in the 40s the Homes were not what they were to become a location known for drugs killings and nighttime sounds of gunfire One of the most noticeable differences back then compared to today was the makeup of the resident families Most of the children we played with unlike my sister and I lived with both parents More than likely there were other singleparent households but I can recall none Fathers worked and the mothers often did as well The buildings and yards were well kept91  There was no graffiti in this project On hot summer nights it was not uncommon for people to sleep out on the balconies or in the case of firstfloor apartments in their yards In the adjoining local black neighborhood it was not uncommon to see old men sitting around a table out on the street on hot summer nights playing checkers or cards during an era when most people could not afford air conditioning92 The contrast with the housing projects and ghetto neighborhoods of later years could hardly be more stark   When the shooting gets bad children are put to sleep in bathtubs and under beds so they wont be struck by random bullets Residents must pay tribute to guntoting teenagers in order to enter their own buildings get mail and ride the elevator Many have become prisoners in their own apartments afraid to walk hallways strewn with empty crack vials used condoms and excrement where the lights have been put out by muggers and drug dealers The buildings themselves crumble in decay from neglect and vandalism Those who can escape do leaving behind an increasingly poor and demoralized underclass The projects are increasingly seen as some other America isolated and feared havens of addiction violence and problem people93  162 Wealth Poverty and Politics    Contrast that with today when most people living in officially defined poverty have central air conditioning cable television and multiple television sets per household but who would not dare to leave their apartment doors unlooked    Political Factors 163  The demographic makeup of the housing projects residents was also a contrast with that in earlier times  Women headed 90 percent of the families with children and 81 percent of the households received aid to families with dependent children AFDC Unemployment was estimated to be 47 percent in 1980 Although only a little more than 05 percent of Chicagos more than 3 million people live in Robert Taylor Homes 11 percent of the citys murders 9 percent of its rapes and 10 percent of its aggravated assaults were committed in the project94  The retrogressions in educational achievement among blacks in parts of the United States as well as the retrogressions represented by family disintegration rising drug addiction violence and criminal behavior have been strikingly similar among lowerclass whites in England Moreover these and other social retrogressions proliferated during the same time period from the 1960s onward on both sides of the Atlantic A whole way of life among lowerclass whites in England remarkably similar to the way of life in black ghettos in the United States has been detailed in a classic account Life at the Bottom by Theodore Dalrymple a British physician who worked in a hospital near a lowincome housing project and in a prison   As regards the housing projects he observed The public spaces and elevators of all public housing blocks I know are so deeply impregnated with urine that the odor is ineradicable And anything smashable has been smashed95 The physical degeneration of the premises has been matched by social degeneration among the people living in them The unmarried mother with multiple children by multiple fathers none of whom support their children financially or in any other way has become common in lowincome white neighborhoods in England As for the behavior of such children in England Dr Dalrymple recounted the troubles of a 50yearold lady who lived alone in a slum and was a patient of his  The children in her street mock her unceasingly when she leaves her house they push excrement through her mailbox as a joke She has long since given up appealing to their mothers for help since they always side    164 Wealth Poverty and Politics  with their children and consider any adverse comment on their behavior as an insult to them personally Far from correcting their children they threaten her with further violence96  Putting excrement through someones mailbox was not an isolated aberration but a common expression of social disapproval among such people97 In the schools a common expression of social disapproval of those few students who seriously try to learn is beating them up the same treatment meted out in America to some ghetto children who are accused of acting white Some of the lowincome white children in England were beaten so badly by other lowincome white children as to require medical treatment at the hospital where Dr Dalrymple worked98   Crime in England likewise skyrocketed in the second half of the twentieth century In 1954 there was a total of 12 armed robberies in London including 8 where the weapon was not real at a time when anybody could buy a shotgun there England had long been known as one of the worlds most lawabiding nations But the number of armed robberies rose to 1400 in 1981 and 1600 in 199199 in an era of severe restrictions on the purchase of all firearms A scholarly study found In the decade after 1957 the use of guns in serious crime increased a hundredfold100   In England as in the United States crime rates had been going down for years before they suddenly reversed and rose during the second half of the twentieth century101 as the social vision of the intelligentsia triumphed in both countries not only as regards the welfare state but also as regards a more lenient nonjudgmental attitude toward criminals This was all part of a pattern of serious social retrogressions in both countries A nonjudgmental society is a society where common decency is optional and therefore not likely to remain as common  Another parallel with the situation in the United States is that lowincome children of immigrants in England outperformed low income nativeborn children educationally A study in Britain in 2013 compared test results among children of various ethnic and    national backgrounds all of whom were from families with incomes low enough to qualify for free lunches in school   Children of African immigrants in this economic bracket met the test standards nearly 60 percent of the time as did children of immigrants from Bangladesh living at the same economic level Children of black immigrants from the Caribbean at the same economic level met the standards under 50 percent of the time White nativeborn children from families at the same economic level met the standards 30 percent of the time In the borough of Knowsley such white children scored lower than black children in any London borough102  While these educational results in England may seem very different from those in the United States in terms of the race of those doing better and those doing worse they are remarkably similar in terms of children from a different foreign culture doing better in school than nativeborn children from a lowerclass culture whether in England or America The usual explanations of substandard educational performances in black ghetto schools whether genetics racial discrimination or a legacy of slavery obviously do not apply to lowerclass whites in England But the outcomes are strikingly similar  What lowerclass whites in England and ghetto blacks in the United States have in common is a legacy of a generationslong indoctrination in a welfare state ideology of victimhood grievances and a vision of barriers stacked against them that make their prospects hopeless This welfare state ideology is backed up by welfare state programs that subsidize an economically counterproductive and socially destructive lifestyle   Meanwhile the children of lowincome immigrants not burdened by the ideology that generations of the lowincome nativeborn population have been steeped in do far better in both countries In Life at the Bottom Dr Dalrymple said I cannot recall meeting a sixteenyearold white from the public housing estates that are near my hospital who could multiply nine by seven I do not exaggerate Even three by seven often defeats them103 Genetic determinism can hardly explain abysmal educational results in children from a race that  Political Factors 165    produced such mental giants as Shakespeare and Newton but which now turns out many youngsters unable to cope with simple arithmetic Nor is there a legacy of slavery or racial discrimination excuse that would apply   While the white students who do so badly in England are from that countrys lowerincome class poverty is not a sufficient explanation because such children represent a retrogression from previous generations of children from lowincome families104 just as in the United States Dr Dalrymples father was born in a slum But that was in an earlier time when even a school in the slums maintained educational standards and did not pander to the poor by nurturing a sense of grievance and of unfair barriers blocking their rise as schools have in later times105 Instead schools of the earlier era sought to equip youngsters with the human capital needed to rise out of poverty106  Among the consequences of the welfare state in both England and America is making it unnecessary for many people to develop their own productive capacities their human capital when they can live on what was produced by others The economic loss to society at large is not simply the cost of welfare state benefits that are transferred to nonproducing members of society but includes the perhaps larger value of output that the recipients could produce if they had to support themselves   In addition the counterproductive lifestyles developed in subsidized idleness in a nonjudgmental world impose serious psychic costs on other members of society especially those financially unable to escape neighborhoods where the offensive and dangerous behavior of those whom the welfare state and its accompanying social vision have relieved from the norms of civilized behavior on both sides of the Atlantic This is in addition to the increased financial costs of prisons  166 Wealth Poverty and Politics    When he died I found his school textbooks still among his

dedicated to keeping them down is even more valuable to politicians who play the role of defenders of the downtrodden in exchange for their votes   The many welfare state programs to support low

advanced by the existence of a large dependent population have not only created advertising campaigns to promote greater use of their programs they have also dispatched their employees to supermarkets in lowincome neighborhoods to point out to people buying food that there are government programs that will pay for their food  Although promoted as a means of helping people trapped by misfortunes beyond their control welfare state institutions have themselves become traps even for people who have in fact been victims of unforeseen but transient misfortunes such as having a costly illness or losing a job The multiplicity of uncoordinated welfare state benefits available have in many American states added up to a total value far exceeding the official poverty level of income and exceeding what low productivity people could earn in the labor market107 After recovery from an illness or other transient misfortunes after jobs become available again for example for many who have been absorbed into welfare state dependency a return to the labor market could involve a significant reduction in their standard of living  If increasing ones earned income by 10000 would involve a loss of eligibility for 15000 worth of governmentprovided benefits that would be in effect an implicit tax rate of more than 100 percent on earned income Even in less extreme cases welfare state beneficiaries  Political Factors 167    168 Wealth Poverty and Politics  can face an implicit tax rate on earned income that is higher than that facing millionaires if the welfare state beneficiaries were to return to gainful employment at the cost of losing their eligibility for government benefits Such disincentives have long been known and understood but neither politicians who benefit from welfare state dependency nor the people whose jobs are in the welfare state bureaucracies have any incentive to correct what is a problem only for others these others including both the welfare state beneficiaries and the taxpayers  We have seen how ethnic leaders in many countries have promoted notions beneficial to themselves but counterproductive for the groups they lead Perhaps it is significant that groups which have risen from poverty to prosperity in various countries around the world have seldom had as many or as prominent ethnic leaders as groups that remain at the bottom Any reasonably wellinformed American can name at least three or four black leaders of the past or present but would find it hard to name even a single comparable Asian or Jewish ethnic leader to whom these groups dramatic rises from poverty could be attributed   The welfare state is also an often overlooked factor in the income disparities lamented by people who promote income redistribution in general and the welfare state in particular In the United States most households in the lowest 20 percent of income recipients have no one working108 Most of the economic resources transferred to them are transferred in kind subsidized housing medical care and other such benefits rather than in money Therefore disparities expressed in money income statistics greatly exaggerate disparities in standards of living especially for people living in what the welfare state chooses to define as poverty   To the extent that the expanding welfare state allows more people to live without working and therefore without earning income or developing their own human capital supporters of the welfare state are contributing to the very income disparities they so much decry The welfare state ideology so essential to creating and maintaining a welfare state can also have negative effects of its own on attitudes and behavior as apparently that ideology has had in both England and the    United States However this is not to say that all welfare states must have the same effects in all countries or that the welfare state ideology must be identical in all countries After all interactions matter here as in other contexts  The preexisting cultural values of different societies or of different groups within the same society can interact differently with the same opportunities presented by the welfare state After all Asian Americans live in the same welfare state as black Americans and Hispanic Americans but have not succumbed to its temptations It may be no coincidence that the group that has longest been wards of the federal government American Indians living on reservations have by a substantial amount the lowest per capita incomes   The cultural context of the welfare state can differ among nations as well as among groups within a given nation The fact that sons born to families in the bottom 20 percent of income earners in Sweden Norway Finland and Denmark do not end up in the bottom 20 percent as adults as often as happens in the United States109 may reflect a different cultural context for the welfare state in these Scandinavian countries That is ultimately an empirical question But the situation at least serves as an illustration of the larger point that a welfare state like geographic cultural demographic and other factors does not operate in a vacuum but interacts with other factors We need not try to universalize the welfare state as it exists in the United States just as we need not presume it to be unique  A more deadly consequence of a pervasive sense of victimhood grievance and entitlement has been a lashing out at others The international treatise Ethnic Groups in Conflict noted how common such lashing out has been in countries around the world and that backward groups are overwhelmingly initiators and advanced groups are targets of ethnic riot behavior110  Ghetto riots that swept across the United States during the 1960s the triumphant decade of the welfare state vision certainly fit that pattern In later years there have been various repetitions of such riots But a new pattern has also emerged in more recent years organized  Political Factors 169    black physical attacks on whites in such public places as shopping malls parks and beaches usually places not located in ghettos   Unlike ghetto riots that erupt as more or less spontaneous reactions to particular incidents even if later intensified by hoodlums who join in the mayhem and looting or career racial activists who stir up mob emotions the new organized attacks on whites are clearly preplanned and coordinated as large numbers of young black males suddenly converge in locally overwhelming numbers to physically attack whites at random   Often the atmosphere among the attackers is more festive than angry111 even though serious and sometimes fatal injuries have been inflicted One victim of such an attack said afterwards I heard laughing as they were beating everybody up They were eating chips like it was a picnic112 Nevertheless some among the intelligentsia continue to use the pat phrase troubled youths to describe exultant young hoodlums  Such racial attacks have occurred in dozens of cities and smaller communities in every region of the United States from coast to coast113 There has been a pattern not only to these attacks but also to media and political responses The most common response might be summarized in one word denial   Where the attacks have been too large too frequent or too widely known in a given community to be ignored the media response has almost invariably been to omit the racial aspect114 that was central to the attackers themselves who often referred to their victims as crackers or said such things as This is for Trayvon Martin Where such attacks across the country over the years have been reported in the media it has usually been as if each attack was an isolated local incident involving unspecified young people attacking unspecified victims for unspecified reasons  Where surveillance cameras reveal the racial makeup of the attackers and their victims mayors and police officials in community after community across the country have been quick to deny that these were racial attacks115 It is usually unnecessary for the media to  170 Wealth Poverty and Politics    deny that these attacks are occurring nationwide because few in the media have ever connected the dots in the first place Investors Business Daily is one of the very few media outlets to call attention to a nationwide pattern of unprovoked and organized racial attacks Across the US mobs of black youths are organizing on Facebook to loot stores and beat whites116 This same information was available to others in the media but it seldom reached the public  One variant of these blackonwhite attacks caught the medias attention briefly the socalled knockout game in which an individual attacker suddenly lets loose a hard punch to the head of an unsuspecting passerby in an attempt to knock him down and if possible out A series of such knockout punch attacks by blacks against Jews in the New York area seemed to catch everyone by surprise in 2013117 even though a 2012 book about blackonwhite violence already had a chapter titled The Knockout Game St Louis Style118 While it may be a game to the attackers the victims have often ended up in the hospital or dead Someone knocked out in a boxing ring lands on canvas someone knocked out on a city street usually lands on concrete  Many who deny or downplay such racial attacks may believe that such denials or downplaying will avoid a white backlash that could escalate into a truly disastrous race war But such attacks seem unlikely to stop unless they get stopped That is unlikely to happen without wider and more honest recognition of the dangers followed by public pressure on elected officials to do something more substantive and more honest than denying that these attacks are racial   Some people may imagine that one way of showing empathy with less fortunate people whether blacks in the United States or low income whites in England is to take a nonjudgmental attitude toward their transgressions as if exempting any group from the standards of civilized behavior is a net benefit to them or to society at large Barbarism is hardly a gift to any community Nor is an eventual violent backlash against barbarism The history of intergroup backlashes such as the Czech backlash against German civilians in  Political Factors 171    Czechoslovakia after World War II119 or the atrocities and counter atrocities between the Sinhalese and Tamils in Sri Lanka during the second half of the twentieth century120 is a history of horrors that no one should want to see repeated on American soil  Letting organized racial attacks continue across the country and perhaps escalate may only delay a larger and more violent racial backlash and polarization as knowledge of such things spreads despite the mainstream media But in this as in many other things political incentives are to postpone the day of reckoning even if that means that the reckoning will be larger and more catastrophic Moreover too many people have too much of a vested interest ideologically if not materially or politically in the welfare state vision to have to admit even the possibility that the negative behavioral consequences of the welfare state and its accompanying nonjudgmental vision must be weighed against the material benefits extended so widely and often so unthinkingly  Many Americans today may find it hard to imagine mobs of whites attacking blacks But it is not necessary to imagine This was precisely what a race riot meant in the United States a hundred years ago especially in the first two decades of the twentieth century121 The first major race riot initiated by blacks took place in Harlem in 1935 Since the 1960s the blackinitiated riot has become the norm But things were different before and can become different again If so the economic losses will be the least of the problems  172 Wealth Poverty and Politics    Chapter 6  IMPLICATIONS   AND PROSPECTS  Youre entitled to your own opinion but youre not entitled to your own facts  Daniel Patrick Moynihan1  Questions about facts are obviously very different from questionsabout values goals or policies We can put particular competing explanations of economic disparities to factual tests and perhaps equally important define our terms precisely enough so that we can at least know what we disagree about While differences of opinion on issues may be inevitable confusion on issues is not  DIFFERENCES  IN  INCOME  AND  WEALTH  What is the reason for differences in income and wealth among individuals races nations or civilizations  The simplest answer is that there is no such thing as the reason There are all sorts of factors and many combinations and permutations of those factors Nor have we enumerated them all and it is by no means certain that anyone could do so But what is clear  173    from the factors we have considered thus far is that the possibilities are too numerous to reasonably expect equal economic outcomes either between nations or within nations when the things that go into creating those outcomes vary so greatly The all too familiar clich about the paradox of poverty in an affluent society is a paradox only to those who start with 1 a preconception of an egalitarian world in defiance of history and 2 a disregard of the arbitrary nature of the governmentdefined word poverty  Much of the egalitarian thrust of contemporary redistributionists is directed toward the reduction or elimination of income or wealth disparities or gaps between various groups But as distinguished economic development economist Peter Bauer of the London School of Economics pointed out The promotion of economic equality and the alleviation of poverty are distinct and often conflicting2 If everyones income doubles that should certainly reduce poverty but it would also widen income gaps and disparities This applies to gaps and disparities both between nations and within nations The welfare state can reduce or perhaps even eliminate poverty in any material sense but it also reduces the need for many people to earn income especially when earning income reduces eligibility for government provided benefits and therefore widens income gaps and disparities  As regards economic differences among nations all too often the question posed is much like that in a wellknown study Why Nations Fail Why is Egypt so much poorer than the United States What are the constraints that keep Egyptians from becoming more prosperous3 This implicitly treats what happens in the United States as a sort of norm as what happens usually or more or less naturally leaving the question as to why this usual normal or natural development has been thwarted somehow in Egypt But Egypt is much more typical of what has happened around the world and over the centuries than is the United States   Given the many factors that go into the creation of wealth and the wide variety of combinations and permutations of those factors there is no more reason to expect those factors to come together in the same  174 Wealth Poverty and Politics    way in Egypt as in the United States than there is to expect that all the factors which come together to produce tornadoes would come together in Egypt as often as they come together in the United States more so than in any other country or all other countries combined4  To pursue the analogy with tornadoes there is nothing absolutely unique that strikes the eye about either the geography or the climate in the United States that cannot be found as individual features in many other places around the world Wide level plains are among the things that facilitate the development of tornadoes but wide level plains exist across much of Europe and in Argentina and India among other places What is unique about the United States is the combination of things that occur together in the middle of the country rather than on the coasts in particular seasons of the year and in the afternoons more so than in the mornings or at night that cause the vast majority of all the tornadoes in the world to occur in the United States  We would not set out to discover why there are not more tornadoes in Egypt if we were interested in knowing how tornadoes originate and behave Similarly there is not much reason to seek the causes of poverty in Egypt or in any other country Poverty genuine poverty has been the lot of most of the human race for most of the existence of the species However a more reasonable question also appears in Why Nations Fail Was it historically or geographically or culturally or ethnically predetermined that Western Europe the United States and Japan would become so much richer than sub Saharan Africa Latin America and China over the last two hundred years or so5  While nothing predestined particular nations or peoples to be more prosperous than others many things facilitated or impeded the economic development of some nations and peoples more than others It is hard to think of any fundamental development that advanced the human race coming out of isolated mountain communities isolated islands or other places where geography impeded access to other peoples Australia being for millennia the  Implications and Prospects 175    classic example of a continent isolated from other continents with Australian aborigines being regarded as classic lagging peoples   It may suggest something about human beings in general that no given individuals or even small societies have been capable of reaching the heights of human achievements without access to the current and previous achievements of vastly larger numbers of other people The invention of the rangefinder used on naval ships and at one time on many cameras drew upon mathematical principles developed in Greece more than two thousand years ago as the Pythagorean Theorem   Without access to thoughts recorded in ancient times and other information developed at other places and other times since then to develop a rangefinder from scratch would be a far more formidable task For more complex inventions the task would be virtually impossible Would an illiterate Einstein growing up in a primitive tribe on an isolated island in the middle of the Pacific Ocean have produced a theory of relativity Even far less earthshaking advances have built on the work of innumerable predecessors scattered in many countries over many centuries going all the way back to those who invented numbers and letters   To ask why nations fail is to treat our conception of success as a norm rather than the rare exception that it is in the long history of human beings It may be an understandable human tendency for us to regard whatever we happen to be used to immediately around us as usual or natural But that does not make it so In preCivil War America slavery was referred to as a peculiar institution because slavery was so inconsistent with the principles and practices in the rest of American society But the tragic fact is that slavery was a pervasive institution among innumerable peoples around the world for thousands of years It is freedom for ordinary people that has been a peculiar institution of relatively recent vintage as history is measured and still in jeopardy in many countries even today as well as being utterly suppressed in some other countries  The real challenge in discussing wealth poverty and politics is to try to understand what peculiar combination of circumstances has  176 Wealth Poverty and Politics    resulted in the level of prosperity found in such places as Japan and Western Europe and in such offshoot nations of Western Europe as the United States or Australia Nor have these particular combinations and permutations of factors been present from time immemorial even in these particular countries In ancient times entirely different countries were on the frontiers of human economic and other advances   Poverty occurs automatically It is wealth that must be produced and must be explained That is why the approach here has been to examine such factors as geography culture demography and politics as influences on production Income is a byproduct of that production This may all seem obvious but its implications are apparently not obvious to many who wish to treat income distribution as a discrete issue with virtually a life of its own while production fades into the dim background as if the patterns of incomes can be changed to suit our desires without any repercussions on production on which the standard of living of society as a whole depends The attempt to treat poverty as a discrete problem one that can be solved by an expansion of the welfare state as in the American war on poverty launched in the 1960s has had social repercussions that should be very sobering   Because the most fundamental statistics on what is called income distribution are so widely misunderstood we need to begin by clarifying what these data do and do not mean After that we can turn to a closer examination of some of the factors behind the differences in incomes that exist within nations and between nations  Income Statistics There are two fundamentally different kinds of statistics used to  show income trends over time and these different kinds of statistics produce diametrically opposite conclusions   The people who appear in one kind of income statistics are a set of the same identical individuals whose incomes are tabulated  Implications and Prospects 177    throughout the years covered by a given study A very different kind of statistics and the kind most often cited in the media in politics and in academia is based on tabulating the incomes of whatever mix of people happen to be in such categories as the top fifth the bottom fifth and other brackets in between in any given year A series of such tabulations in a series of years then serves as the basis for conclusions about the incomes earned in each of the various brackets   These latter kinds of statistics are often cited to assert that incomes of people in the top bracket the rich are increasing relative to the incomes of people in the bottom bracket the poor or relative to incomes of people in other brackets in between Assertions that the gap between rich and poor has widened in America have appeared in the New York Times6 and in innumerable other media outlets including the Washington Post where columnist EJ Dionne described the wealthy as people who have made almost all the income gains in recent years and added that they are undertaxed7 Books like The Fair Society by Peter Corning of Stanford University repeat the same theme that the income gap between the richest and the poorest members of our society has been growing rapidly8  Although such statements which abound throughout the media and are echoed in politics and in academia are phrased as if they are comparing the incomes of specific sets of people over time the rich and the poor they are in fact comparing the incomes of particular income brackets containing an everchanging mix of people over time as individuals move massively from one bracket to another in the normal course of their careers going from entrylevel jobs to jobs that pay far more to successively more experienced people Those who go into business or the professions likewise tend to acquire a larger clientele with the passing years resulting in rising incomes there as well  Studies which actually follow a given set of individuals over time reach not only different conclusions but opposite conclusions from studies which follow income brackets containing everchanging mixes of people at very different stages of their individual careers A study at the University of Michigan that followed specific individuals working  178 Wealth Poverty and Politics    Americans from 1975 to 1991 found that those particular individuals who were initially in the bottom 20 percent in income had their real incomes rise over the years not only at a higher rate but in a several times larger total amount than the real incomes of those particular individuals whose incomes were initially in the top 20 percent9  As a result of their rising incomes 95 percent of those people who were initially in the bottom quintile in 1975 were no longer there in 1991 Twentynine percent of the people who were initially in the bottom quintile rose all the way to the top quintile while just 5 percent remained behind in the bottom quintile where they began Meanwhile over that same span of time those people who were initially in the top quintile in 1975 had the smallest increase in real income by 1991 smallest in both percentage terms and in absolute amount of people in any of the quintiles The amount by which the average income of people initially in the top quintile rose was less than half that in any of the other quintiles10  However radically different this empirical pattern is from the many loudly proclaimed assertions that the rich have been getting richer and the poor getting poorer over time there is nothing surprising about the mundane fact that people who start out at the bottom in entrylevel jobs usually rise over the years to successively higher levels of work and pay Meanwhile those who have already reached middle age where their productivity and earnings are highest are unlikely to see any comparably large further increases in productivity and pay as time goes on   A later study using data from the Internal Revenue Service found a very similar pattern This study followed those specific individuals who filed income tax returns over the course of a decade from 1996 through 2005 Those whose incomes were initially in the bottom 20 percent of this group saw their incomes rise by 91 percent during that decade that is their incomes nearly doubled Those whose incomes were initially in the muchdiscussed top one percent saw their incomes actually fall by 26 percent during that same decade11 Again the facts are the opposite of the loudly proclaimed assertions based  Implications and Prospects 179    on statistics that measure what is happening over time to abstract categories income brackets with changing mixes of people which are then discussed as if they were statistics about what was happening over time to a given set of fleshandblood human beings  A more recent study that followed specific individuals over time in Canada from 1990 through 2009 found patterns very similar to the patterns found in studies of Americans Those Canadians who were initially in the bottom 20 percent in income had their incomes increase at both a higher rate and in a higher absolute amount than those whose incomes were initially in higher brackets12 Yet again what happened over time to a given set of human beings was the opposite of what happened over that same span of time in abstract categories with changing mixes of people In Canada as in the United States the upper brackets incomes were rising faster than the lower brackets incomes and as in the United States this was spoken of as if it represented what was happening to given sets of people13  Unfortunately statistical surveys that follow specific individuals over the years are more expensive than statistical surveys that simply compile data over the years in abstract categories containing ever changing mixtures of people at highly varying stages of their own individual life cycles So it is not surprising that the US Bureau of the Census and numerous other collectors of statistics turn out far more data on what is happening to abstract categories over time than data on what is happening to specific sets of people over time Nevertheless what happens in those abstract categories income brackets over time is then discussed just as if that is what is happening to specific sets of people over time often called the poor and the rich Transients in the various income brackets are spoken of as if they were continuous residents in those brackets  Understandable and commendable as it may be to be concerned about the fate of fellow human beings that is very different from being obsessed with the fate of numbers in abstract categories To say as Professor Thomas Piketty does in his much acclaimed book Capital in the TwentyFirst Century that the upper decile is truly a world unto  180 Wealth Poverty and Politics    itself 14 is to fly in the face of the fact that most American households 56 percent are in the top decile at some point in their lives15 usually in their older years For most Americans to envy or resent the top ten percent would be to envy or resent themselves This is not even class warfare but confusion between social classes and age cohorts   Statistics on income differences are almost universally and automatically discussed as if these must be differences between social classes rather than differences among people of different ages Indeed there is seldom even a mention of the possibility that these numbers can refer to either social classes or age cohorts much less attempts in the popular media to determine to what extent they refer to people of different ages rather than people in different social classes  The income and wealth statistics that are paraded with such fervor can be perfectly accurate and yet completely misleading  If infants have less income or wealth than their parents who in turn have less income or wealth than their grandparents that is hardly the same as if individuals are in wealth or poverty over the course of their lives Yet the latter is a common insinuation garnished with numbers As statistics infants can be the same as grandparents but only as statistics Even if the data are limited to adults younger adults are the same as older adults only as statistics and economic disparities between people of different ages are not the same as economic disparities between classes  Even the vaunted top one percent so often discussed in the media is a level reached by 12 percent of Americans at some point in their lives16 What Professor Paul Krugman refers to as the charmed circle of the 1 percent17 must have a somewhat fleeting charm because most of the people in that circle in 1996 were no longer there in 200518 In Professor Pikettys vision the top one percent in income  Implications and Prospects 181    Young adults can take years to raise their net wealth to zero since people in these age brackets are often in debt for college loans automobiles home furnishings and these debts often exceed their savings Meanwhile people in their 60s have long since passed that point and have had decades in which to accumulate savings equity in a home andor to have put money in a pension plan These age disparities in wealth can be large without necessarily being class disparities    not only live in their own separate world but stand out in society and exert a significant influence on both the social landscape and the political and economic order19 according to Piketty who says that they are atop the hierarchy and structure of inequality20 he projects  There is however a fundamental difference between a structure and a process Piketty glosses over the process in which peoples incomes change substantially over the course of their lives or even in the course of just one decade More than half of all taxpayers moved to a different income quintile between 1996 and 2005 and the same was true in the preceding decade21 Among people in the middle quintile for example 42 percent moved up to a higher income quintile while 25 percent dropped to a lower quintile and only 33 percent remained in the middle quintile22  Turnover is especially pronounced among those with the highest incomes While less than half the people in the top one percent were still there at the end of a decade only about onequarter of those in the top onehundredth of one percent in 1996 were still there in 200523 More than half saw their incomes cut in half or more during that decade24 The turnover is even faster among those taxpayers with the 400 highest incomes in the country incomes far higher than among the top one percent as a whole Fewer than onefourth of the income tax filers with the top 400 incomes in 1992 were in that same bracket more than once during the years ending in 2000 and only 13 percent were in that extremely high bracket more than twice during those nine years25 At very high income levels whether the top one percent onehundredth of one percent or the top 400 incomes that income is far more likely to come from investments which are far more volatile than salaries  In short even more than most people in other income brackets most of the people among the top 400 income recipients are transients in this case mostly people with a spike in income for just one year out of nine Whether their one year at this level is due to receiving an inheritance or otherwise cashing in assets accumulated over the previous years or is due to some other reason the people who  182 Wealth Poverty and Politics    are fleeting residents in this income bracket are hardly credible candidates for the powerful andor sinister roles assigned to them in much ideological and political rhetoric This is not to say that there are no enduringly wealthy people who in fact have lives and lifestyles far removed from those in the rest of society The question is whether they are the same people as those who happen to be in particular income brackets at particular times Otherwise what is the point of citing those statistics based on everchanging mixes of people and talking about them as if they were data on a given set of human beings over time    Pikettys crucial misstep is verbally converting a fluid process over time into a rigid structure with a more or less permanent top one percent living isolated from the rest of society that is supposedly subjected to their control or influence It is a vision divorced from demonstrable facts however consonant it may be with prevailing preconceptions    Much has been made of Pikettys voluminous statistics from various countries But as JA Schumpeter said long ago You can travel far and wide and yet wear blinkers wherever you go26 Testing the accuracy of Pikettys vast array of statistics would be a monumental task and a task perhaps not worth the time and effort since the real question is not about the accuracy of the numbers themselves but about the accompanying misstatement of what the numbers are measuring However it may be worth noting in passing that Pikettys repeated statements that the top income tax bracket under President Herbert Hoover was taxed at 25 percent are contradicted by an official Internal Revenue Service document showing that the top income tax bracket in 1932 was taxed at 63 percent27  Another source of confusion in discussions of peoples economic differences is a failure to distinguish income from wealth Income and wealth are too fundamentally different from each other to make confident inferences about one from statistics about the other Use of the term the rich to describe people in higher income brackets is just one sign of the confusion between income and wealth since being rich means having an accumulation of wealth rather than simply a  Implications and Prospects 183    high income in a given year This is not just a matter of semantics At a practical level raising income tax rates to make the rich pay their undefined fair share is an exercise in futility since income taxes do not touch wealth It is a tax on people who may be trying to accumulate wealth but people who already have accumulations of wealth either personally earned or from inheritance are exempt   Praise for billionaires who say that they are in favor of higher income tax rates is completely misplaced when those higher tax rates will not touch their billions even if such tax rate increases are a serious burden to other people who are trying to get ahead and accumulate something to leave for their families after they are gone  Implicit in much discussion of income distribution statistics is the notion that certain income brackets receive not only a higher share of total income but do so at the expense of lower income brackets That is the poor are made poorer by the rich who become richer according to this view Some such as Washington Post columnist Eugene Robinson have made this claim explicit as when he said The rich are getting richer at the expense not only of the poor but of the middle class as well These nonrich are referred to as longsuffering victims of the upper crust who have been waging an undeclared but devastating war against them28  Mr Robinson has however inadvertently performed a real service by bringing to the surface a widespread undercurrent of confusion that cannot withstand scrutiny in the light of day We can put aside for the moment his implicit assumption that trends in statistics about income brackets with their everchanging mixes of people are the same as trends about what is happening to given sets of fleshand blood human beings called the rich and the poor We may for the sake of argument leave that particular confusion aside in order to focus attention on the rest of his argument  Even during periods when a higher share of total income goes to the top income bracket that does not prevent the real income received in the bottom bracket from rising absolutely During the period from 1985 through 2001 for example the income share of the bottom 20  184 Wealth Poverty and Politics    percent of American households declined from 4 percent of all incomes to 35 percent of all incomes but the average real income of households in the bottom 20 percent rose by thousands of dollars29 This is not even taking into account the welldocumented fact that most people initially in the bottom income quintile move up and out of that quintile over a span of years as long as that in this example But even if they had all stayed put the rising amount and share of income of the rich would still not have made them poorer as the data show   The rising absolute real income in the bottom quintile happened over the years while the number of billionaires has been growing and according to people like Eugene Robinson prospering at the expense of the poor against whom the rich were waging war However since most households in the bottom 20 percent in income have no one working30 it is not clear what the rich can be taking from those who are producing nothing  The Randomness Assumption With very few of the things that go into creating economic  production being equally available to all either among nations or within nations it is hard to understand how the expectation of equality in economic outcomes has acquired such a hold on contemporary thinking that income inequalities disparities gaps or inequities are taken as being at least strange if not sinister But gross inequalities in outcomes are rampant in all kinds of human endeavors around the world whether economic or otherwise including those that can hardly be explained by discrimination exploitation or the many other sins of human beings Those sins are real but their moral significance does not automatically make them causal factors of the same significance in economic outcomes That is an important empirical question though one seldom addressed by moral crusaders   Because the implicit assumption that even or random outcomes are natural is so widespread and so consequential in its moral political  Implications and Prospects 185    and even legal implications it is an assumption that needs to be examined at some length and confronted with many facts about many different kinds of human endeavors As we have seen in earlier chapters geographic demographic and cultural factors are often grossly unequal Moreover people do not behave randomly but purposefully They do not for example immigrate randomly either in terms of the locations they come from in the country they leave or the locations where they settle in the countries they go to They do not raise their children the same as shown by the large differences in the number of words people at different socioeconomic levels speak to their children   Purposeful human activities are seldom random in themselves or in their consequences Nor are they the same among different groups whether different by race sex religion birth order or innumerable other variables  Differences in achievements are drastic not only in economic endeavors but in all sorts of other endeavors from the most mundane to the most exalted An international study of widely recognized European historic figures in the arts and sciences from the beginning of the fifteenth century through the middle of the twentieth century found their geographic origins highly concentrated in particular places Thus 80 percent of all the European significant figures can be enclosed in an area that does not include Russia Sweden Norway Finland Spain Portugal the Balkans Poland Hungary East and West Prussia Ireland Wales most of Scotland the lower quarter of Italy and about a third of France31  In the United States the same study found that about half of the significant American individuals in the arts and sciences from the time of the founding of the republic to the middle of the twentieth century were concentrated in an arc extending from Portland Maine to the southern tip of New Jersey The New England states plus New York Pennsylvania and New Jersey produced more than seven times the number of significant American figures in the arts and sciences as did the states that had formed the Confederacy during the Civil War  186 Wealth Poverty and Politics    Most of those Southern states had none at all with Virginia being a notable exception32  Similar extreme disparities have been found in individual accomplishments in sports Among professional golfers who had survived to the final two rounds of a Professional Golfers Association PGA tournament there was a rough approximation of a normal bell curve when it came to such individual aspects of golf as the average number of putts per round of play or driving distances off the tee33 But there was a radically skewed distribution of results when it came to the ultimate test of the combinations of the various golf skills namely winning PGA tournaments   Even among the above average group of professional golfers who had survived to the final two rounds of a PGA tournament 53 percent never won a single PGA tournament in their entire careers Among the 47 percent who did win a PGA tournament almost all won just one two or three34 But Arnold Palmer Jack Nicklaus and Tiger Woods each won dozens of PGA tournaments and more than 200 among the three of them35  There have been similarly very skewed distributions among winners of Grand Slam titles in tennis batting championships in baseball and winners of points in world chess championships36 Of the 100 topranked marathon runners in the world in 2012 68 were Kenyans37 When two American boys whose ancestors came from India tied for first place in the US National Spelling Bee in 2014 it was the seventh consecutive year in which the Spelling Bee was won by an Indian American Indian Americans had also won twelve of the previous sixteen38 During the twentieth century there were eight times when a major league baseball player stole 100 bases or more All eight times that player was black39  The same skewed distribution is found among recipients of academic degrees As of the early twentyfirst century every justice of the US Supreme Court had a degree from one of the eight Ivy League institutions in the northeast out of the thousands of American colleges and universities across the country Among people who earned a  Implications and Prospects 187    Bachelors degree in the United States in academic year 20112012 nearly fourfifths of those with degrees in education were women and nearly fourfifths of those with degrees in engineering were men40  Although blacks greatly outnumber Asians in the American population and slightly outnumber them among recipients of Bachelors degrees Asians received more than twice as many Bachelors degrees in engineering as blacks41 The disparity is even greater at the top engineering schools where Asians have outnumbered blacks by threetoone at MIT tentoone at Harvey Mudd College and by fortytoone at Cal Tech42 But even the extreme disparity at Cal Tech was not as great as the disparity between Chinese and Malays earning engineering degrees in Malaysia during the 1960s During that decade students from the Chinese minority earned just over a hundred times as many engineering degrees as students from the Malay majority43 in a country where the Malays control both the universities and the government that sets university policies  Examples of such gross disparities in innumerable human endeavors could be extended almost indefinitely just counting those where the circumstances virtually preclude discrimination such as men being struck by lightning several times as often as women or dominant majorities being outperformed by subordinate minorities44  Despite these and many other examples of outcomes in many different kinds of human endeavors that are remote from an even or random distribution in situations where discrimination can be ruled out the implicit assumption persists that uneven or nonrandom outcomes are strange and suspicious Moreover these are not just casual opinions They are conclusions that have carried great weight in courts of law in cases involving disparate impact statistics which show demographic underrepresentation of particular groups that are very different from what would be expected by random chance Among the intelligentsia in the media or even in academia such statistics are often treated as virtually ironclad proof of discrimination The implicit assumption of randomness thus trumps innumerable contrary facts  188 Wealth Poverty and Politics    showing grossly uneven and nonrandom outcomes from all sorts of purposeful human endeavors Moreover serious laws and policies are based on these assumptions in defiance of facts  Redistributionists seldom if ever offer a principled criterion by which current inequalities might be judged Few today are prepared to say that there should be absolute equality of income or wealth but they seldom offer more than ad hoc pronouncements that current inequalities are too much   Perhaps the closest they come to some principle is that current inequalities are greater than the inequalities in some other time or place But this offers no principle on which to choose a particular time or place to serve as a standard for judging other times and places Moreover the ignored production processes change over time making different mixes of skills and talents more in demand than before and others less in demand than before requiring different patterns of pay as incentives to attract people with the currently more valued qualifications  An obvious example of such changes has been the reduced value of physical labor as machine power has in many cases replaced human muscle thereby making the male workers advantage in physical strength less relevant reducing the pay gap between the sexes even before there were equal pay laws   To say that pay differences between people at the top and people at the bottom have increased over the years means something very different when these are differences between classes than when these are differences between people in different age brackets Only 13 percent of American households headed by someone 25 years old have been in the top 20 percent of household incomes while 73 percent of households headed by someone 60 years old have been45 Since every 60yearold was once a 25yearold increased income differences between age brackets are hardly an injustice to Americans who live out a normal lifespan   Increased income differences between those at the top and those at the bottom may in other situations reflect a greater demand for  Implications and Prospects 189    particular skills relative to unskilled and inexperienced labor or a greater demand for financial expertise relative to personnel department experience for example Increased income disparities may also reflect the fact that an increasing proportion of the population can live without working or with only sporadic or parttime work thanks to the many benefits available from the welfare state These benefits are not counted in income statistics even though the value of these inkind benefits ranging from subsidized housing to medical care greatly exceeds the recorded money income of people in the bottom 20 percent of income recipients46  In short income statistics greatly overstate differences in standards of living between income brackets because income data are reported before taxes and before massive transfers of inkind benefits especially to those in the bottom income brackets   Not all differences in income are due to age or welfare of course but whatever these differences are due to the changing requirements of the production process imply that there is no reason why a particular pattern of income or wealth differences from a particular time or place should remain unchanged or serve as a benchmark for people living in other times and places  Even less is there any reason why intellectuals or politicians should acquire increased control over the lives of millions of fellow human beings as each imperfection of life is discovered or claimed Not since the era of the divine right of kings has there been such an implicit assumption that some people are entitled to take away the right of other people to make their own decisions about their own lives Often such powers are claimed on the basis of what is called social justice  Social Justice Perhaps the bestknown contemporary exposition of moral  principles relevant to differences in income and wealth has been that in John Rawls influential treatise A Theory of Justice Professor Rawls conception of social justice in the economy is that those who are at  190 Wealth Poverty and Politics    the same level of talent and ability and have the same willingness to use them should have the same prospects of success regardless of their initial place in the social system that is irrespective of the income class into which they are born47  Perhaps few Americans would object to this ideal even if they might disagree as to how or whether it can be put into practice However that ideal is almost immediately modified by Rawls with the proviso that the advantages of persons with greater natural endowments are to be limited to those that further the good of the poorer sectors of society48 That is because Justice is prior to efficiency according to Rawls49 and differences in natural ability are as undeserved and therefore as unjust as being born an heir to a fortune  To say as Rawls does that unjust rewards may be tolerated only to the extent necessary to benefit people in the poorer sectors of society raises both factual and moral issues As we have seen the poorer sectors of society as defined by income are a transient group disproportionately of the younger and less experienced and no one remains younger for life Among that small proportion 5 percent of those in the bottom income quintile who remain there over the years as most others move on up it cannot be arbitrarily assumed that this unusual fate can have nothing to do with the way they have chosen to live their lives  To say as Rawls does that morally nothing should be done to benefit the rest of society if it does not also help those at the bottom50 can amount to enshrining a veto on progress on behalf of those with a counterproductive lifestyle Many conclusions that might make sense in a world of predestination do not make sense in a world of individual choices That such choices may be influenced by past social conditions does not mean that they cannot also be influenced by current rewards or penalties for current conduct including non judgmental subsidies of counterproductive behavior  Our survey of peoples and places around the world in earlier chapters in search of reasons for disparities in income and wealth whether between nations or within nations has been implicitly a  Implications and Prospects 191    search for reasons behind differences in productivity Others who are more interested in redistributing incomes and wealth often leave the production of these incomes and this wealth in the dim background By pushing the production process off into the background redistributionists avoid confronting the question whether income inequalities might be matched by corresponding inequalities in economic productivity   What redistributionists seek to suggest or to proclaim is the injustice of existing rewards given that so much of what a given individual receives originated in some windfall gain or windfall loss of which the accident of birth is central In short redistributionists seek to judge merit more so than productivity or even in some cases to the exclusion of productivity given the Rawlsian principle that justice is more important than economic efficiency  We can use the criteria of social justice advocates for the sake of argument Imagine a man who was born to parents who were not merely poor but alcoholic irresponsible and neglectful or abusive toward their children For such an individual born in such a family to somehow have wrenched himself away from the culture of such an environment and become a very decent and hardworking man acquiring a skill such as carpentry to support himself and his family whom he treats far better than he was treated as a child would certainly be a meritorious achievement  Imagine now a different man born in very different circumstances to loving and caring parents raised in an affluent or wealthy home with all the advantages that social position can confer in terms of private education and wider cultural exposure For such a man to go on to become a brain surgeon would certainly be commendable but by no means necessarily more of a meritorious achievement than that of the carpenter  In a world where rewards were based solely on merit there would be no obvious reason to pay the brain surgeon any more than the carpenter was paid But in a world where productivity matters this is no longer a question of the relative merits of individuals What is far  192 Wealth Poverty and Politics    more important than meritbased social justice to particular income recipients is the wellbeing of all the people who stand to benefit from what they produce Introducing production into the discussion makes a big difference It is now a question of the relative urgency of brain surgery and carpentry and of providing incentives for young people of high ability however acquired to choose the long and challenging preparation to become brain surgeons out of the many options they have however unjust it may be that some people have so many more options than others have  Instead of limiting ourselves to weighing the relative economic fates of particular individuals or groups as income recipients a discussion of the goods and services produced by those individuals or groups weighs as well the fate of those other members of society who benefit from the goods and services produced by those who are the sole or primary focus of income redistributionists   To call the fate of consumers of goods and services a matter of efficiency while calling the fate of those who receive incomes for producing those goods and services a matter of social justice and then making social justice categorically more important than efficiency as Rawls does51 is to make a distinction without a difference If income is redistributed in a way that reduces efficiency which is what makes the distinction relevant then the economic losses of some as consumers are simply arbitrarily declared to be less important than the economic gains of others from social justice But what is an injustice if not an undeserved cost of some sort inflicted on people It is hard to see how an undeserved cost inflicted on people in their role of consumers is morally different from an undeserved cost inflicted on people in their role of income recipients   Solutions The question must be raised as to the basis for arming intellectual  coteries with the massive powers of government to forcibly undo economic transactions terms made by millions of people intimately  Implications and Prospects 193    194 Wealth Poverty and Politics  familiar with their own individual circumstances and alternatives in a way that distant intellectuals or government functionaries cannot possibly be familiar Moreover what if those millions of people do not share Rawls notion that justice is more important than efficiency Indeed if any two things each have some value one cannot be categorically more valuable than the other as Rawls claims52 A diamond may be worth much more than a penny but enough pennies will be worth more than any diamond   Comfortable academics on ivycovered campuses may be able to afford a preoccupation with statistical patterns and a preference for income numbers that fit their preconceptions But that is very different from saying that people mired in poverty genuine poverty perhaps in the Third World are wrong to welcome some billionaire investor who wants to set up a factory near them that will provide jobs enabling them to give their families things they have never been able to afford before just because that billionaires investment will also make him richer than before to the discomfort of those reading statistics on distant campuses or in distant editorial offices  Those among the intelligentsia and other social justice advocates may prefer a statistically more equal society to a more prosperous society even one that is better able to subsidize the poor But while that is the right of those who hold such views it is also the right of others including lowincome people to prefer a more prosperous society If the aversion of the intelligentsia to the level of inequality in the United States were shared by the poor in other countries it would be hard to account for the longstanding massive and sometimes desperate efforts of poor immigrants from around the world to reach America  The very idea that millions of fellow human beings must be forced to arrange themselves in a tableau pleasing to a relative handful of intellectuals or politicians is not only grotesque in itself but still more    Multinational corporations typically pay higher wages than local employers in the Third World    amazing as part of a claim of higher morality equality or humanitarianism under the name of social justice Nor does the actual track record of intellectuals in many other aspects of life inspire confidence in either their assumptions or their conclusions   One of the reasons for paying people for their productivity rather than their merits is that productivity is far easier to determine than merit This is especially so in a market economy where the value of what is produced is judged by whoever chooses to buy it and use it Few can have anything approaching a comparable knowledge or understanding of someone elses merit especially when they have not walked in his shoes   This of course does not mean that nothing whatever should be done to widen the options of those born into less fortunate circumstances and who consequently have had fewer options for developing their productivity Indeed there has never been a time in the entire history of the United States when nothing whatever was being done for such people American society is one where major voluntary philanthropy has been going on for centuries The United States has been and is unique in the extent to which private philanthropy has created schools libraries scholarships colleges foundations hospitals and other civic institutions that are elsewhere provided by government or by religious organizations  Nor have all contributions been in money Vast amounts of time have been donated to many civic causes including those aimed at extending the options available to the less fortunate The thousands of whites from the North who went into the South after the Civil War  Implications and Prospects 195    It was after all not the unwashed masses but exquisitely educated intellectuals who urged Western democracies to disarm in the 1930s while Hitler was building a massive war machine in Germany and while imperial Japan was doing the same in Asia And it was the triumph of the intellectuals social vision in America during the 1960s that was followed by sharp reversals of long downward trends in murder rates and rates of venereal diseases and teenage pregnancy in the population at large as well as the disintegration of twoparent black families which was the norm a hundred years after slavery but not after 30 years following the expanded welfare state of the 1960s    to teach the children of newly freed slaves in private institutions established by philanthropists were a classic example  These teachers usually young women braved nearly impossible conditions including the hostility of Southern white society from which they were often ostracized and sometimes threatened and many utterly unprepared black students handicapped both by the experience of slavery and by the general Southern culture in which education was by no means a high priority WEB Du Bois called the work of these white volunteers from the North the finest thing in American history53  Much of such philanthropic activity as this is ignored by those who largely ignore productivity in general whether economically or socially motivated productivity But such voluntary civicminded activities cannot be taken as given natural or something that just happens somehow It differs as greatly as the economic production that is so often also treated as something that just happens somehow in disregard of how very differently it happens in different places and times with correspondingly different effects on peoples standards of living But such civicminded activities do not occur equally in all societies around the world or even to the same extent throughout Western civilization   Nineteenth century French visitor Alexis de Tocqueville was struck by the extent of voluntary civic activities among Americans as he reported in his classic Democracy in America54 But distinguished American scholar Edward C Banfield found no such widespread attitudes or practices in the Italian mountain village where he stayed in the middle of the twentieth century where some find the idea of publicspiritedness unintelligible No one will lift a finger to assist a nun carrying a heavy burden to the orphanage at the top of the mountain and though the local monastery is crumbling none of the many halfemployed stone masons has ever given a days work to its repair55  A twentyfirst century study of Russian society likewise found very little civicmindedness or even organized voluntary social activities in  196 Wealth Poverty and Politics    general as compared to the United States This study of non governmental associations in 60 countries found that Russias best ranking was in sports and recreation where the country rose as far as 9th from the very bottom In that category nearly 4 of the adults surveyed said they were involved in a sports club or some other athletic voluntary association But less than 2 percent were involved in voluntary social welfare activities to help others   Among Americans the study found that participation is roughly ten times higher in sports and social welfare organizations roughly twenty times higher in environmental religious and professional organizations roughly thirty times higher in culturaleducational and womens organizations and roughly fifty times higher in human rights organizations56  The limiting factor in the success of efforts to raise the educational and economic levels of those born into less fortunate circumstances is the degree of receptivity of many of the people born and raised in a culture that does not provide them with the desire habits or discipline required to make the most of expanded opportunities Here the leadership of lagging groups is often a major impediment to those groups advancement since such leaders have every incentive to promote a vision in which the groups problems are caused primarily if not exclusively by the sins of other people What incentive is that to engage in the arduous process of trying to change oneself  This is a leadership pattern that has appeared on every inhabited continent so there is no reason to expect a different pattern in America or in any other country except for highly exceptional leaders here and there The great eighteenth century philosopher David Hume could urge his fellow Scots to learn English precisely because his career was not that of an ethnic leader When you want to help people you tell them the truth When you want to help yourself you tell them what they want to hear People with careers as ethnic leaders usually tell their followers what they want to hear  Those who have promoted the prevailing vision in which lags gaps or disparities to the detriment of black people are the fault of  Implications and Prospects 197    other people are trapped in the corollary that these lags gaps or disparities should disappear once those other people are constrained by civil rights laws and policies But nothing of the sort has happened in the wake of the civil rights revolution of the 1960s However dramatic the increase of black political representation at local and national levels there were no correspondingly dramatic reductions in economic disparities Economic progress continued but the rise out of poverty was not at as fast a pace as in the years preceding the civil rights revolution of the 1960s57  This leaves those who cling to the prevailing vision little alternative but to claim that even an absence of concrete evidence that continuing black lags gaps or disparities can be traced to what others are doing only shows that the continuing gaps must be due to the diabolical cleverness with which covert or institutional racism has been concealed When an absence of tangible evidence is assumed to prove a proposition that tangible evidence would also prove that is essentially an arbitrary headsIwinandtailsyoulose argument But given the initial premises of those who are driven to this desperate expedient genetic determinism might seem to loom in the background Hence the fierce but strained and unconvincing attempts to come up with alternative explanations   A more realistic set of initial assumptions rather than the prevailing civil rights vision could have spared such apologists from having painted themselves into a corner where they have to resort to such questionable claims The economic gap between Eastern Europeans and Western Europeans is greater than the economic gap between blacks and whites in America58 and has persisted for centuries even though Western Europeans have been in no position to thwart the economic rise of Eastern Europeans Yet those who  198 Wealth Poverty and Politics    However dramatic the political changes in the wake of the civil rights laws the economic improvements in the wake of these laws have shown no sustained upward movement over and above the upward trend line of economic improvements among blacks that began in the decades preceding the civil rights revolution of the 1960s    expected blacks to rise to parity with whites in a few decades had obviously left many things out of their calculations   Given the specific historical circumstances of American blacks their record has by no means been something calling for some esoteric apologetics or blameshifting As a white Southern scholar observed in the early twentieth century no race has come further against greater handicaps A race peremptorily shorn of its cultural heritage became in three generations a group substantially comparable to the peasant classes of our western culture The failure to advance further at that time may be due mainly to contacts restricted by inescapable physical stigmata that is social isolation based on color Though limited in cultural opportunities encircled by race prejudice as by a barrier of fire the Negros rise to partial land ownership to industrial position and to a modicum of success in the arts and sciences is frankly a notable achievement for any race59  This was said at a time when most black adults had only an elementary school education and in inferior Southern schools at that Whatever may be said about the pace of black progress in the first hundred years after slavery that progress was not marked by the kinds of stark retrogressions in behavior that set in among lowerclass blacks in the 1960s and then spread to others The unwillingness to acknowledge these retrogressions much less try to deal with them makes the further reduction of economic gaps between blacks and whites needlessly more difficult  International Differences in Wealth For different nations around the world to all have even  approximately similar incomes or wealth despite their great differences in geography culture history political systems religious beliefs and the demographic makeups of their respective populations would require virtually a miracle Nevertheless the status quo is by no means predestination and the histories of particular very poor and very backward nations of the past that have moved to the forefront of human  Implications and Prospects 199    achievement and prosperity show what can be done The dramatic rise of Scotland in the eighteenth century Japan in the nineteenth century and Singapore Hong Kong and South Korea in the twentieth century all show what can be done and to some extent how  None of these heartening examples of dramatic economic rises was due to the international transfers of wealth known as foreign aid Nor were these economic rises due to nationbuilding by outsiders whether foreign governments or various experts supplied by international agencies such as the World Bank or the International Monetary Fund Despite the many attempts to blame the poverty of some nations on exploitation by other nations or by foreign investors it would be hard to find nations that rose from poverty to prosperity by ridding themselves of colonial overlords however desirable that might be on other grounds or by confiscating the property of foreign investors Indeed impressive lists of the failures or even counterproductive consequences of such approaches can be and have been compiled60  Still less often can nations be found that rose from poverty to prosperity by expelling or by driving out through oppression or mob violence various minorities widely described as exploiters or parasites such as the Jews in Eastern Europe the Chettiars in Burma the Asians in East Africa or others in various other parts of the world and in different periods of history   Often the nations that drove out such groups were worse off economically after they were gone and the nations that welcomed them were better off The United States has benefitted from the arrival of millions of Jews from Europe who not only provided disproportionate numbers of people in many professions but also included world class scientists who were disproportionately represented among those who created the first nuclear bomb on which Americas international position as a superpower rested   The descendants of great conquering nations and peoples often have little to show economically from the historic feats of their ancestors whether the hordes of Genghis Khan the Spanish conquistadors the Ottoman Turks or others Some conquests have  200 Wealth Poverty and Politics    left behind prosperous progeny among the descendants of the conquerors but these were usually conquests by nations that were already prosperous such as the British who conquered and settled Australia and most of North America displacing the indigenous populations in both places The even larger conquests of Spain in the Western Hemisphere usually led to nations in Latin America that have seldom been as prosperous as the former British colonies in North America or Australia even when the Latin American countries have had fertile soil and rich natural resources  If there is any common thread in these widely varying outcomes it seems to be human capital This can be seen by comparisons of nations and by comparisons of groups within given nations   Argentina for example has been described as among the worlds most richly endowed countries with extraordinarily fertile land in which the roots of some plants go down 15 feet in soil unencumbered by rocks61 Unlike some other Latin American countries Argentinas population is predominantly of European ancestry Yet Barbados whose population is predominantly of subSaharan African ancestry that is this population originated in a region of the world much poorer than Europe has a 40 percent higher per capita Gross Domestic Product than that of Argentina62  Although the Barbadians arrived in the Western Hemisphere as slaves and the Spaniards arrived as conquerors the Barbadians absorbed the British culture in which they lived longer than the peoples of sub Saharan Africa from which they came and the British culture was very different from the culture of Spain as regards the values attached to work education and entrepreneurship among other cultural factors that the British promoted and the Spaniards disdained Cultural differences among groups within Argentina reinforce the conclusion that the inherited culture from Spain was no more economically productive in the Western Hemisphere than it was in Western Europe where Spain has long been one of the poorer countries  Immigrants to Argentina from other parts of Europe than Spain have been much more economically successful than the native  Implications and Prospects 201    Argentines even when these immigrants were initially very poor on arrival This was especially true of immigrants from Italy who were the largest number of immigrants to Argentina in the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries Italian immigrants were 40 percent of all immigrants to Argentina as early as 1864 and remained nearly 40 percent half a century later in 191463  Two of the most striking ways in which Italians in Argentina differed from the Argentines was in the Italians willingness to take on the hardest work and to save even out of low incomes Seasonal migrants from Italy were in great demand as agricultural laborers and have been credited with contributing to the vast expansion of agriculture in nineteenth century Argentina64 In addition to these agricultural laborers who were called golondrinas or swallows because they came and went with the seasons there were other Italian farm workers who remained as permanent residents These latter Italians often began as peons and then saved over the years until they could become sharecroppers and then eventually landowners65  Despite the unusual fertility of Argentine land the country imported wheat until foreign farmers notably Italians but also including Germans from Russia among others arrived and transformed Argentina into one of the worlds great wheatexporting nations66 But the fact that the land was always capable of growing wheat meant nothing before Argentina acquired people who were prepared to do what was required to be successful wheat farmers Yet again geography is not predestination  In the cities as in the farmlands Argentines were outperformed by immigrants As of 1914 foreigners who were about 30 percent of the Argentine population owned 72 percent of the commercial businesses in Argentina and 82 percent in Buenos Aires67 Italian entrepreneurs in Buenos Aires predominated in the production of alcoholic beverages except beer where the Germans were pre eminent68  Argentines were not noted for saving and were in fact called the spendthrift of the world69 In 1887 the Banco de la Provincia de  202 Wealth Poverty and Politics    Buenos Aires had twice as many depositors who were citizens of Italy as there were who were citizens of Argentina70 During that era most of the Italian immigrants were laborers but at the same time most of Argentinas masons seamen tradespeople architects importers engineers and restaurant and hotel owners were also Italian71  The Argentine government itself recognized differences between immigrants from different countries in Europe and sought to attract people from outside the Spanish culture prevailing in Argentina They deliberately sought at first to attract immigrants from Britain Germany and Scandinavia but without much success so they then welcomed immigrants from Italy and Spain preferably Northern Italians and Basques from Spain people with very different cultures from those in southern Italy or in the rest of Spain Basques for example being noted for being thrifty and hard workers72 The Argentine government also sent agents to Europe to recruit Germans there73 Volga Germans settled in what then became Argentinas wheat belt74  While people from outside the prevailing Spanish culture of Argentina dominated much of that countrys economy Argentines dominated its political institutions In the early twentieth century Argentina was one of the worlds most prosperous nations ranking above France and Germany for example75 But by the middle of the twentieth century disastrous political policies dropped Argentina out of the front ranks of nations economically Despite its rich soil and other natural advantages including a location that spared it from being devastated by two World Wars like nations in Europe Argentinas political culture destroyed the prosperity that the country s economy had once enjoyed Messianic political demagoguery and class warfare rhetoric and policies epitomized by Juan Peron and his wife Evita patroness of the shirtless ones were part of an economically counterproductive pattern that began before them and continued long after their time nullifying both the advantages provided by nature and the human capital supplied largely by foreigners whether immigrants or international investors and entrepreneurs   Implications and Prospects 203    Argentina was by no means the only country in Latin America whose economic advancement was heavily dependent on foreigners especially those from countries other than the founding nations of Spain or Portugal to develop its economy As late as the mid twentiethcentury in Brazils most industrialized states So Paulo Rio Grande do Sul and Santa Catarina most of the industrialists were recent European immigrants or their children In So Paulo 521 enterprises out of 714 were owned by men in these categories In Rio Grande do Sul and in Santa Catarina nearly fourfifths of the industries were developed by people of similar description76 Germans and Italians were especially prominent In the state of Rio Grande do Sul Germans in the early twentieth century were the sole producers of metal furniture trunks stoves paper hats neckties leather soap glass matches beer confections and carriages as well as the sole owners of foundries and carpentry shops77  Not only in industry but also in agriculture immigrants were sought from outside the Iberian peninsula The government of Brazil like the government of Argentina deliberately recruited Germans in Europe78 to be immigrants who would not be reluctant to do the hard physical labor of pioneering in the wilderness nor were disdainful of it like people from the Portuguese culture of Brazil and the Spanish culture of Argentina The state of So Paulo subsidized the immigration of Italian peasants79 The governments of Chile and Paraguay likewise deliberately sought European immigrants from outside the Iberian peninsula for the hard work and severe living conditions that went with pioneering in opening up virgin wildernesses in these countries80  In short these governments recognized cultural differences in the work habits skills and values required to develop their countries whether in agriculture or in industry and commerce despite however much the recognition of such differences may be taboo in many places today In the words of distinguished French historian Fernand Braudel it was immigrants who created modern Brazil modern Argentina modern Chile81  204 Wealth Poverty and Politics    Not all these immigrants were from Europe Japanese immigrants played a significant role in the economies of Brazil and Peru Although the Japanese were only 2 to 3 percent of the population in Brazils state of So Paulo and owned less than 2 percent of its land they produced nearly 30 percent of the states agricultural output in the early 1930s including 46 percent of the cotton 57 percent of the silk and 75 percent of the tea A substantial proportion of the banana plantations were also in Japanese hands82  Peru was another Latin American nation in which a small number of Japanese immigrants played a disproportionate role in the economy Beginning in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries as agricultural laborers working under conditions that led to high death rates83 the Japanese in Peru soon moved into urban communities where they began working in occupations ranging from domestic servants to small business owners84 Eventually the Japanese owned threequarters of all the barbershops and 200 grocery stores in Perus capital city Lima Even as agricultural laborers the Japanese work habits made them more in demand than Peruvian workers and the Japanese laborers were paid more85  The Japanese acquired a reputation not only for hard work but also for reliability and honesty86 They also took more interest than Peruvians in the education of their children The illiteracy rate in Peru was 79 percent in 1876 and though it declined over the generations 58 percent of the population was still illiterate in 194087 Manufacturing firms in Peru during this era were usually controlled either by foreigners or by recent immigrants   Like other minority groups who have been more successful than members of the majority population in other times and places the Japanese were resented in Peru These resentments were expressed in editorial criticisms and in boycotts of Japaneseowned businesses though these boycotts failed because the Japanese usually charged lower prices than others88 However political measures against the Japanese were more effective These included a law requiring at least  Implications and Prospects 205    80 percent of all employees to be Peruvians89 and immigration from Japan was severely restricted in the mid1930s90  In Chile foreigners in general played a disproportionate role in the development of the countrys economy As late as the middle of the twentieth century most of the industrial enterprises in Santiago Chile were controlled by either immigrants or the children of immigrants91 Nor was this an unusual pattern in Latin America where there has often been an overrepresentation sometimes an absolute predominance of nonHispanic nonPortuguese immigrants and their children among the leading commercial and industrial figures of various countries92  Disdain for commerce and industry at the higher social levels of Hispanic and Portuguese societies whether in Europe or among their Western Hemisphere offshoots has been paralleled by an aversion to manual labor and hard work at the lower social levels What has been involved in such attitudes has not been simple laziness but what a scholar writing about seventeenthcentury Spain characterized as pride in indolence reflecting an aversion to the stigma associated with manual work in that culture93  Centuries later Paraguayans were bewildered by the unrelenting work of people in Japanese agricultural colonies in their country94 and Honduran farmers complained that it was unfair for them to have to compete with German farmers in their country since the latter were considered to be working too hard95  Latin America has by no means been unique on the world stage in not simply failing to reach the standards of productivity set by others but in positively rejecting resenting and restricting those who were more productive and explaining away their own lags by blaming exploitation by others at home and abroad Latin American intellectuals led the way in developing dependency theory blaming the lags of South Americans on North Americans and others Eventually the striking success of Asian countries that opened their economies to foreign trade foreign investors and foreign technology eroded the foundations of dependency theory in Latin America But not before whole generations had paid the price of this selfindulgence   206 Wealth Poverty and Politics    When considering cultural or other factors timing must be considered among the reasons for particular outcomes Finally abandoning dependency theory offered the possibility for more economic progress but the negative effects of all the years when that theory was an obstacle to economic growth were not negated Similarly a nation whose population remained illiterate while literacy became widespread among other nations will of course benefit from finally bringing literacy to its own people but that will not put its people on a par with people in countries where literacy has been the norm for generations or for centuries  Timing is important in another sense It has long been observed that a transplanted culture is less subject to change than the culture in its country of origin Thus many words and phrases in the French spoken in Quebec and in the Spanish spoken in Mexico have become archaic in France and Spain Some of the counterproductive attitudes that Latin America inherited from Spain have been said to have begun to change in Spain itself more so than in Latin America96  It is hard to escape the fact that former British colonies proper that is countries founded by a transplanted British population have generally done better economically than former Spanish or Portuguese colonies Nor can this be due to the British Empires having made better initial choices as to places to settle because the Spanish Empire was established first giving Spain the first choices Spaniards conquered lands and peoples in both North America and South America in the 16th century before the first permanent British settlement in America was established tenuously at Jamestown in the 17th century  FACING  THE  FACTS AND  THE  FUTURE  In dealing with the social and economic problems involving wealth poverty and politics specific policy prescriptions are not necessarily the most urgent need Blueprints for Utopia are available  Implications and Prospects 207    in abundance What are not nearly so abundant are prerequisites for rational thinking about current problems and future alternatives The most important of these prerequisites is the truth Whatever destination we are seeking either literally or figuratively we can only get there from where we are This means that we must first know the truth about where we are in order to advance toward our destination   If our physical destination is Hawaii then we must first know whether we are currently east west north or south of Hawaii Otherwise we are likely to head in the wrong direction to get there If the destination we wish to reach is figurative and social rather than geographic the same principle applies If we wish to promote the economic or other advancement of black Americans for example we need to know the truth about where black Americans are now not where we might wish they were or where some blacks might prefer to believe they are or to have others believe they are but where they are in fact in truth Wrong premises seldom lead to correct conclusions  What are the obstacles to knowing the truth Unfortunately these obstacles are all too plain and all too  numerous They include things you cannot say even with a mountain of empirical evidence behind you and other things you can shout from the rooftops without a speck of evidence behind you and in defiance of whatever evidence exists to the contrary This is nowhere more true than on college and university campuses where either a student or a professor publicly speaking unpalatable truths about any minority group currently in favor risks adverse reactions ranging from becoming an instant social pariah to punishment under campus speech codes to physical harassment and threats of violence  Meanwhile there are other things that can be said no matter how demonstrably false with little risk of even criticism much less discrediting   Unfortunately arbitrary premises that are demonstrably false and misleading abound in all too many settings whether in academia the media or in government One of the most pervasive of these false premises is one that we have already noted the assumption that  208 Wealth Poverty and Politics    disparities in economic outcomes among nations or among groups within nations are symptoms of malign actions by others This implicit assumption of equal outcomes in the absence of malice flies in the face of evidence from around the world that geographic demographic cultural and other factors influencing outcomes are not even approximately equal Nor are performances in purely individual endeavors that can be objectively measured such as individual performances in sports chess or spelling bees all of which show highly skewed distributions of success  Given the many things that go into economic productivity and the many differences among people in their likelihood of having those things there is a major difference between equal opportunity and equal chances of achieving a given outcome a difference often ignored or blurred  Even a Nobel Prizewinning economist like Joseph Stiglitz says that one way of looking at equality of opportunity is to ask to what extent the life chances of a child are dependent on the education and income of his parents More specifically he asks Is it just as likely that a child of poor or poorly educated parents gets a good education and rises to the middle class as someone born to middleclass parents with college degrees As evidence of unequal opportunities he says Latinos and AfricanAmericans still get paid less than whites and women still get paid less than men According to Professor Stiglitz Americans are coming to realize that their cherished narrative of social and economic mobility is a myth97  If equal opportunity and equal probability of success are used interchangeably what does that accomplish It finesses aside the question whether some people make better use of their opportunities than other people do When Asian students outnumber white students by more than twotoone in each of New York Citys three elite public high schools Stuyvesant Bronx Science and Brooklyn Tech98 are we to say that whites are being denied equal opportunity   Are we to say that this must mean that Asians have higher incomes and more education than whites even when we know that Chinese  Implications and Prospects 209    immigrants from Fujian province have neither Are we to equate equal opportunity with equal chances even when we know that the children of black doctors and lawyers in affluent Shaker Heights neglect their studies99  Words matter So does the slippery use of words which can insinuate what they cannot substantiate To people who are seeking the truth it is a crucial question whether or to what extent those groups who are less successful are being thwarted by external barriers that is by less opportunity or instead are less successful because of their own internal deficiencies in knowledge discipline values or other things that affect their life chances But to people who are seeking ideological victory that is precisely the question to be kept off the agenda  If Joseph Stiglitz prefers to make life chances his issue that is his prerogative But to claim that he has refuted other peoples belief in social mobility as a myth is to impute his conception of social mobility to those other people And to cite as evidence income differences between blacks and whites or between women and men is to add to the confusion when many if not most Americans would take that to mean that external discrimination must be the reason   Yet innumerable empirical studies have shown that blacks and whites as groups do not have the same job qualifications and that women and men likewise differ in many of the things that go into economic advancement beginning with the simple fact that women average fewer hours of employment per year and fewer years of continuous employment among many other consequential differences100  As far back as 1971 those single women who had worked continuously from high school into their thirties were earning slightly more than men of the same description101 even though women as a group were not earning as much as men as a group were earning As far back as academic year 197273 while black academics as a group earned less than white academics as a group nevertheless those black academics with PhDs from equally highranked universities as  210 Wealth Poverty and Politics    whites and with equal numbers of articles published earned more than white academics of the same description102  The approach of Professor Stiglitz is by no means unique Redefining words is a major part of the ideological arsenal of income redistributionists in general whether discussing the less successful or the more successful members of society When discussing the latter the very concept of achievement is often replaced by the concept of privilege For example another writer has argued that income statistics show unambiguously that persons of IrishCatholic ethnicity were the second most privileged group in US society adjudged on the basis of annual income educational level and occupational prestige with Jews being the most privileged103  What makes this statement grotesque is that Irish and Jewish immigrants were among the most desperately poor of the immigrants who arrived in the United States in the nineteenth century and lived in a poverty and squalor unseen today and virtually inconceivable today   That the Irish and the Jews rose from such painful beginnings to prosperity in the next century is an achievement not a privilege That they did so in the face of once common employers notices that said No Irish Need Apply and in the face of quota limits on how many Jewish students would be admitted to Harvard and other elite universities and even smaller limits usually zero on how many Jewish professors would be appointed during the preWorld War II era makes their achievements more striking even as others now try to make those achievements vanish by the verbal magic of calling them privileges Even middleclass blacks have been described as privileged104 though their ancestors were by no means brought to America as doctors lawyers or teachers  The same word games are played in discussions of group differences in outcomes in foreign countries and not simply by politicians or journalists but in serious academic publications Thus Malays in Malaysia for example have been referred to as deprived105 and nonMalays as having privilege106 despite  Implications and Prospects 211    pervasive governmentmandated preferences for Malays in both public and private institutions Similarly Canadians of Japanese ancestry in Toronto have been described as privileged because they have achieved higher incomes than others in that city107 despite a prior history of severe antiJapanese discrimination in Canada climaxed by internment during the Second World War for longer than Japanese Americans were interned108  In short the achievements of these and other groups after long and hard struggles upward are made to vanish from discussion by a simple substitution of the word privilege for the word achievement even though privilege refers to a condition that exists ex ante and achievement refers to a condition that exists ex post More fundamentally these tactics remove behavior and productivity from discussions of intergroup economic disparities So too does the tactic of arbitrarily dismissing any negative information about particular groups as stereotypes Such verbal virtuosity is an obstacle to truth simply by corrupting the words that might otherwise convey unwelcome truths that redistributionists avoid  Moreover by focusing on the rewards received for achievements such statements ignore the benefits of those achievements for others which is the very reason that those others whether employers patients customers or other recipients of the goods or services that people with these achievements produce are willing to pay their own money to receive those benefits As in many other contexts productivity vanishes into thin air by verbal sleight of hand when discussing the income distribution that results from that productivity It is as if all that matters is the income difference between A and B ignoring the benefits of their respective achievements for C D E and many others  Preoccupation with the differential benefits to those with various achievements too often obscures the benefits of those achievements to society as a whole Back in prehistoric times whoever invented the wheel or whoever first figured out how to start a fire may well have acquired an advantage over others but surely what is most important  212 Wealth Poverty and Politics    is that these things were major additions to the human capital of mankind in its infancy It might well have been even better if everyone all over the world had acquired these advances at the same time But surely what is far more important than this theoretical possibility is that these fundamental advances were in fact made in the real world as the human race began its long advance toward civilization  When some children today are raised in ways that make it easier for them to become doctors scientists or engineers that is not simply a differential advantage over other children who are raised in ways that make it more likely that they will become welfare recipients or criminals These are differences that affect the wellbeing of the whole society Yet there are academics who deplore college admissions decisions based on the academic qualifications of individual applicants because in their view this is simply rewarding those who have already been privileged The consequences for society of different admissions criteria are considerations that simply vanish into thin air just as with the group activist in Nigeria who deplored the tyranny of skills109  In a sense there is indeed a tyranny of skills though it exists independently of a given institution or a given society because of inherent realities beyond our control The presence or absence of medical skills for example can be the difference between life and death for millions of people That is an inherent reality or tyranny we cannot escape All that a given institution or society can do is recognize the value of skills or else subordinate skills to social preconceptions or political expediency Skills confer benefits even on those who do not have skills When a graduate of a selective public high school and a selective city college in New York created a polio vaccine that was a boon to people of every income level and every race color creed and nationality around the world   Frequent expressions of astonishment at how large the differences in rewards are between individuals groups or nations seldom lead to questions as to whether what is produced by those who receive these rewards differs correspondingly It is not so much that  Implications and Prospects 213    redistributionists give different answers to that question than others give More fundamentally that question is seldom asked much less answered Here again production usually remains somewhere in the dim background as something that just happens somehow  Studies of people who became genuinely rich with huge fortunes like that of John D Rockefeller may abound with assertions about their greed But those who use such characterizations seldom pose the most basic question What did Rockefeller supply to others that caused so many of those others to turn their own individually modest sums of money over to him adding up to his vast fortune   Despite the frequency with which greed is invoked in this context it explains absolutely nothing unless you believe that an insatiable desire for money will itself cause others to pay you that money But regardless of how often this causally meaningless explanation greed has passed muster among the intelligentsia a more oldfashioned expression conveys a more fundamental truth If wishes were horses beggars would ride Greed may or may not be an accurate characterization of any given individual but wishes cannot explain why others provide the money to satisfy those wishes   Nor is the amount of wealth received even a barometer of greed A smalltime criminal who robs a little momandpop store and kills the owner to keep from being identified is surely greedy even if the money received from the robbery is trivial compared to what an engineer or a surgeon earns honestly in a month   In the case of John D Rockefeller his fortune began in the nineteenth century with his reducing the price of kerosene to a fraction of what it was before his innovations in production and distribution greatly reduced the cost of producing and delivering this product to consumers110 For example the units in which we measure oil today are barrels even though oil is no longer actually shipped in barrels but in tankers due to Rockefellers costsaving shift to railroad tanker cars  As of the time when this happened light bulbs had not yet been invented so the ancient saying The night cometh when no man can  214 Wealth Poverty and Politics    work still applied to all who could not afford to use candles or oil burning sources of light for hours at a time each night Many working class people had few options besides going to bed when nightfall came Only after Rockefellers innovations in production and distribution cut the cost of kerosene to a fraction of what it had been before were ordinary people able to afford to stay up for hours after dark using kerosene lamps   What such people were purchasing were hundreds of hours of additional light per year It is hardly surprising that millions of people were willing to pay to enlarge their lives in this way   We take so many of the benefits of todays world for granted that it is hard to conceive of how different life was in the world of earlier times much less grasp the full impact of landmark advances that enabled people to transcend the severe limitations of those times   It has been estimated for example that most Americans in the early nineteenth century lived out their entire lives and died within a fiftymile radius of where they were born111 The railroad and the automobile expanded their world to vastly larger dimensions especially in the early twentieth century after Henry Fords mass production methods drastically reduced the cost of producing an automobile This changed cars from being luxuries of the rich to being accessible to the masses   The fortune made by Henry Ford was an incidental byproduct of this historic expansion of productivity that expanded the lives of millions Why third parties should imagine themselves entitled to intervene in such processes to which they contributed nothing and to preempt the decisions of others decisions for which the interventionists pay no price when they are wrong is one of the many mysteries of our time  Many fortunes of historic dimensions came from producing a new product or making an old product either better or cheaper or both In less spectacular ways as well other people who have acquired other skills are paid for what those skills add to the lives of other people whether these are the skills of doctors curing diseases or the skills of  Implications and Prospects 215    pilots transporting hundreds of people thousands of miles Acquiring valuable skills to do these and other things is an achievement that benefits others rather than a privilege that benefits only themselves at the expense of others The difference is fundamental regardless of how much verbal cleverness goes into obscuring that difference  Redistributionists may demand proof that all fortunes or all high incomes are earned that way but this is putting the burden of proof on others instead of putting the burden of proof on those who seek to restrict the freedom of their fellow human beings to live their own lives and make their own economic decisions as they see fit There is no reason why the divine right of kings from earlier centuries should be inherited by todays intelligentsia or politicians  Are there imperfections in a market economy Yes There are imperfections in all things human including alternatives to the market economy As a distinguished scholar put it The study of human institutions is always a search for the most tolerable imperfections112  None of this means that the status quo must be maintained It cannot be and has not been Even leading conservative figures ranging from Edmund Burke in the eighteenth century to Milton Friedman in the twentieth century have advocated major social changes The fact that they opposed some other changes does not mean that they opposed change as such But the word change is not a blank check for selfindulgence least of all selfindulgence in the notion that disparities imply villainy which in turn implies a crusade on the side of the angels against the forces of evil despite how self flattering such a vision of the world might be   216 Wealth Poverty and Politics    In addition to devoting years to the impeachment of the British viceroy of India on grounds that he oppressed the native peoples Burke advocated the abolition of slavery at a time when that was a distinctly minority view in Western civilization and virtually a nonexistent view in nonWestern societies Burke even drew up plans for preparing slaves for freedom and providing them with property with which to begin their lives as free people  Milton Friedman proposed sweeping changes in public schools and in the Federal Reserve System as well as a negative income tax to transfer money to lowincome people Burke said A state without the means of some change is without the means of its conservation and Milton Friedman wrote a book titled The Tyranny of the Status Quo      An even more dangerous illusion is that the undoubted unfairness of life chances is a reason to give politicians ever more control of a nations resources and ever more power over our individual lives The track record of that approach is at the very least sobering when even most socialist and communist governments had been forced by counterproductive consequences to abandon economic central planning by the end of the twentieth century and when the material benefits of an expansive welfare state to some in England and the United States have been accompanied by painful social retrogressions to the detriment of each society as a whole  Most important of all whatever changes are made must begin with the truth about our current situation whether that truth is palatable or unpalatable if change is to mean progress To the extent that this book has offered at least a slice of that truth it has achieved its purpose Drawing up policy blueprints is a task for which there has never been a shortage of eager candidates We can only hope that those policies will be based on hard facts about the real world rather than on rhetoric or preconceptions  Implications and Prospects 217    EPILOGUE  Few subjects provoke such strong emotions as differences inincome and wealth especially when these are differences between groups into which individuals are born and usually remain for life such as races castes tribes or nations in descending order of permanence People can change nationality by immigrating but changing race is an option available to a relatively few people of hybrid ancestry and not without psychic costs to those few including costs which such people have often refused to pay which would have been the consequence of abandoning the race into which they were born  People born into groups defined by religion such as Jews or Mormons all have an option to redesignate themselves but likewise usually do not Therefore concerns and resentments over group differences in income and wealth engage the emotions of many individuals who may be doing quite well economically themselves but who belong to groups that are not Indeed even where both the individual and the group to which that individual belongs are prospering more so than the rest of society there are moral issues raised  218    Among black Americans such historic figures as Homer Plessy of Plessy v Ferguson fame and Walter White the midtwentieth century head of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People were physically indistinguishable from white men but remained socially black by choice The landmark Supreme Court case of Plessy v Ferguson was made possible only because Plessys attorney gave prior notice to the railroad company involved that a man classified as black would challenge racial segregation by traveling in a railroad car legally designated as for whites only Had Plessy simply seated himself in that car without explicitly proclaiming his racial classification there is little reason to believe that he would have been questioned much less prosecuted but the whole point was to have a legal case to pursue in order to challenge racial segregation laws in the courts    about whether the less fortunate are receiving not only enough for a decent life but also social justice however that term might be defined   The strong emotions surrounding issues of income and wealth make careful and honest uses of words especially important if our goal is truth and not simply ideological victory in a contest of fencing with words Among the careful distinctions we need to make is the distinction between causation and blame and between the general unfairness of life and the question of specific unfairness in particular institutions or in particular societies   CAUSATION  Both moral and causal arguments are important but amalgamating the two even implicitly is a formula for confusion perhaps exemplified in the catch phrase blaming the victim Whether particular individuals groups or nations with poorer outcomes are in fact victims of others is precisely the question that is preempted by this phrase There is no question that for an individual to be born blind or crippled is a tragic misfortune but that in itself does not mean that someone has victimized that individual There are after all causes besides humans various geographic features being obvious examples For a group a race or a nation to be located in a geographic setting that affords far less promising prospects of either prosperity or progress can be a major fundamental misfortune but that in itself does not mean that some other people have victimized them   Determining where some disadvantage to particular individuals or groups originated is often no easy matter Because data collected at a given institution may convey a certain negative outcome does not mean that the institution where those data were collected caused that outcome Some hospitals have significantly higher death rates than others precisely because they have the most highly skilled doctors and the most advanced medical technology and therefore treat patients with the most difficult lifethreatening medical problems that some other  Epilogue 219    hospitals are simply not equipped to handle A hospital that treats mostly people with routine medical conditions such as child birth or broken legs may well have a lower death rate than a hospital which performs operations like brain surgery or heart transplants Higher death rates at more advanced hospitals convey a reality that these hospitals did not cause That reality in this case is that its patients have more severe afflictions for which neither they nor the hospital are to blame  Similarly with outcomes in economic and social institutions where negative outcomes at particular institutions are often more or less automatically taken to mean that it was these institutions which caused negative results that the data collected there conveyed When for example statistics on the employment pay and promotion of people from different ethnic backgrounds are collected at a particular business differences in these respects from one group to another do not mean that the cause of such differences must have originated at those businesses where data conveying these differences originated  Often other data or just common observations show children being raised differently in different groups and behaving and performing differently in schools or in society as they grew up years before they reached a particular employer Yet courts of law have accepted disparate impact statistics collected at particular businesses as evidence of discrimination by those particular businesses In the same vein group differences in results on particular tests are often taken to mean that these tests are biased when the scores on these tests convey differences among the participants which these tests are accused of causing by asking questions geared to a white culture for example even when Asian Americans in fact score higher than whites on these tests  Individuals groups races and nations may be handicapped by their cultural settings as they have been handicapped by their geographic settings In either case their misfortunes do not necessarily mean victimhood which requires people who are victimizing others While cultures are manmade they were usually made jointly by people long dead before the present generation was born and these cultures were  220 Wealth Poverty and Politics    certainly not made with malice against future descendants In short misfortunes cannot automatically be transmuted into victimhood by a catch phrase not if one is serious about the truth rather than fencing with words To suggest that there can be cultural patterns inconsistent with progress in the world as it has evolved is not to blame the victim except for those who are satisfied with trying to verbally turn the tables on people who speak unwelcome truths  The Localization of Blame People who seek blame rather than causation often also seek a  localized source of evil to blame Professor Paul Krugman for example refers to slavery as Americas original sin1 when in fact slavery was a virtually universal evil around the world for thousands of years of recorded history Would anyone refer to cancer as Americas horrible disease No doubt cancer has been a dreadful affliction for many Americans but it is not a localized affliction What was different about Americans was not that they suffered the ravages of cancer but that American doctors and medical researchers led the fight against cancer resulting in Americans having the worlds highest rate of survival against various forms of cancer2  In parallel fashion slavery was not peculiar to the United States to white society or to Western civilization What was peculiar to Western civilization was not that it had slavery like nonWestern civilizations around the world but that Western civilization was where the drive to destroy slavery began a drive that lasted more than a century fought on many fronts and succeeded over the opposition of nonWestern societies3 Only the military dominance of the West in the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries allowed the West to impose the abolition of slavery on the countries it conquered or threatened along with many other things good bad or mixed imposed during the era of Western imperialism  Referring to slavery as Americas original sin was not a verbal slip peculiar to Professor Krugman Many intellectuals and others act as if  Epilogue 221    222 Wealth Poverty and Politics  enslavement of fellow human beings was peculiar to the white race or gross economic inequalities peculiar to capitalism or imperialism despite a vast historical record to the contrary and despite other economic and social systems and other races and religions leaving a trail of horrors matching or exceeding anything in the West or under capitalism or imperialism  Evils common to human beings around the world and across thousands of years of recorded history do not provide as promising a target for ideological crusades as evils attributable to an identifiable localized source of evil that can be removed and replaced by whatever one puts ones faith in But universal evils or failings of human beings can mean that even the most sweeping devastating and bloody victory over those currently in power may produce only a change in the cast of characters without changing the tragedy itself The tyranny and carnage that followed the French Revolution was at least as horrible as the horrors of the old regime it replaced In the twentieth century the replacement of oppressive monarchical dynasties by Communist Fascist and Nazi dictatorships was a major change for the worse  The false narrative of Americas original sin has led to other false narratives including the legacy of slavery as a blanket explanation of various forms of social pathology in todays black ghettos With both false narratives sheer repetition has substituted for empirical verification The question is seldom asked much less answered as to whether todays levels of oneparent families or murder rates among blacks have existed since the time of slavery or have escalated to present levels largely since the 1960s As of 1960 most black children were still being raised in twoparent families which have become the exception rather than the rule after the 1960s  Nor was the level of violence in black communities in general or in housing projects in particular at the levels of today While it is true historically that rates of both broken families and violence were higher in black communities than in the American population at large that was not uncommon among other lowincome groups    whether in the United States or in other countries and whether or not the lowincome groups had been enslaved But neither oneparent families nor violent crime was as high among black Americans in the middle of the twentieth century as today Homicide rates among black males were in fact declining substantially during the much lamented 1950s but this trend abruptly reversed during the much celebrated 1960s and rose sharply to significantly higher levels than in either 1950 or 19604 Labor force participation rates were higher among blacks than among whites in every census from 1890 to 1970 but the reverse has been true for every year since 19725 This reversal occurred in the wake of the expansion of the welfare state not in the wake of slavery  The fundamental problem is not that some people were not familiar with these facts The fundamental problem was that they chose to make sweeping assertions without bothering to check the facts and that their sweeping assertions have been widely accepted and repeated in the absence of supporting facts and in defiance of readily available contrary facts  Multiple Causation The fact that the human species achieved nothing that we today  would consider to be civilization until well within the last 10 percent of its existence has weighty implications for our times Even races and nations that are today considered the most backward are more advanced than any race was during most of the existence of the human species Were all the races of the world genetically inferior for all those scores of millennia Or was some other factor or factors holding them back   The most obvious factor was isolation in prehistoric times as in later times Huntergatherers could travel only so far and could interact with only so many other huntergatherers in ancient times How could a huntergatherer in Scandinavia even suspect the existence of other huntergatherers in Asia or even Southern Europe  Epilogue 223    much less interchange goods or thoughts with them across continents and certainly not interchange genes Even today we look in vain for breakthroughs on the frontiers of knowledge from people living on isolated islands or in remote mountain villages or from people living anywhere who are isolated by illiteracy Such people may have all they can do to survive much less try to keep up with what other people in more advanced settings are doing  At a minimum this suggests that the truly isolated human being denied even vicarious contact with the rest of his species through reading about them is incapable of achieving even a small fraction of what his potential might be if immersed in the knowledge created by his contemporaries and heir to the knowledge of the many generations that went before him Indeed even a hundred or a thousand isolated human beings knowing only each other and nothing about other contemporaries or predecessors have seldom if ever produced anything the world has bothered to notice   Yet there is no evidence that human genes changed drastically within the last 5 or 10 percent of human existence Nor is there any hard evidence that the specific races that made the first world changing advances in agriculture in the Middle East on the Indian subcontinent or in ancient China were genetically superior then or now These are certainly not the most prosperous or the most advanced regions today  What seems far more likely in this context as in many others is that a large number of factors had to come together and interact in order to produce a particular outcome such as civilization Most of those factors might well have been present for millennia but impotent without the other factor or factors needed to complete the prerequisites for civilization Yet once agriculture was established on a scale sufficient to permit or promote urbanization there began many advances within the last few millennia of recorded history across a wide sweep of human endeavors by descendants of people who previously did not even know how to plant seeds to grow food Yet this development of civilization led ultimately to people who can  224 Wealth Poverty and Politics    now travel to the moon and send complex scientific instruments throughout the solar system and beyond into outer space This enormous disparity of achievements between different eras of human existence dwarfs disparities between rich and poor contemporaries in the world of today Yet this vast disparity between the achievements of different eras hardly seems explicable by either victimhood or genetics  This scenario of progress has yet to be played out fully in the Amazon jungles or in other isolated places around the world even though people in such places have benefitted as consumers of products created by fellow human beings in more fortunate settings  If a number of factors have to come together in order to produce a given outcome whether tornadoes or economic advances then it is possible that a number of those factors may come together in a number of places while all of the factors come together in very few places or even in only one If there are ten factors required for success in a particular endeavor individuals or groups with nine of those factors will not necessarily do 90 percent as well They may be utter failures The net result can be a very skewed distribution of outcomes whether the particular outcome is most of the worlds tornadoes occurring in just one country or a trio of professional golfers winning more than 200 PGA tournaments while most professional golfers never win even a single PGA tournament in their entire careers   Most notable economic scientific or intellectual achievements involve many factors beginning with a desire to succeed in the particular endeavor without which all the ability and opportunity mean nothing just as the desire and the opportunity mean nothing without the ability What this implies among other things is that an individual a people or a nation may have some many or most of the prerequisites for a given achievement without having any real success in producing that achievement And yet that individual that people or that nation may suddenly burst upon the scene with spectacular success when whatever the missing factor or factors are finally get added to the mix   Epilogue 225    Poor and backward nations that suddenly moved to the forefront of human achievements include Scotland in the nineteenth century and Japan in the twentieth century But there have been other social phenomena pointing in the same direction as examples of multiple causation  We have become so used to seeing numerous worldclass performances by Jewish intellectual figures that it is necessary to reflect that this has been a phenomenon that burst upon the world in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries There were individual Jewish intellectuals of international stature here and there in earlier centuries but the proliferation of Jewish Nobel Prize winners across numerous fields in the twentieth century was a new and unpredictable phenomenon Since Jews existed as a separate people for thousands of years before and had a long tradition of reverence for learning most of the factors required for their breakout in the nineteenth century may already have been present But for centuries Jews were denied the rights of Christians in Europe or the rights of Muslims in the Middle East and these included access to universities  The first Christian nation in which Jews had the same rights as other people was the United States late in the eighteenth century when the American Constitution simply forbad religious distinctions in the law After the French Revolution in 1789 France also granted equal rights to Jews As restrictions against Jews began to erode in Europe Jews began to flow and then to flood into universities The missing ingredient had apparently been added   Conversely when a given individual group institution or nation has already had a highly successful combination of factors for many years either internal changes in just one of those factors or changes in external circumstances can suddenly drop that institution that people or that nation out of the top ranks in the particular endeavor Thus the Eastman Kodak Company s global dominance in photographic equipment and supplies for more than a century came to a sudden end in the early twentyfirst century including a decline into bankruptcy when the worldwide shift to digital cameras made  226 Wealth Poverty and Politics    film film cameras and the chemicals and equipment for developing film obsolete   Chinas historic decline over the centuries from an advanced nation in the forefront of human progress to a Third World country prey to more powerful nations in many ways began with a decision by its fifteenth century rulers to isolate China from the outside world Loss of just one prerequisite rulers rational enough to avoid irreparably selfdestructive policies was enough to negate all the other positive qualities that had for centuries given China historic achievements   Just as a combination of prerequisites for success in a particular endeavor may deny success to individuals groups institutions or nations that may have most of those prerequisites but not all so may variations in the number or kind of prerequisites from one endeavor to another let individuals or groups seriously lagging in some or most other endeavors nevertheless be not merely competent but outstanding or even dominant in particular endeavors that do not require the particular qualities or circumstances that they do not have even if there is fierce competition within the particular endeavor in which they compete   Thus during the era when Irish American immigrants and their offspring were overrepresented among unskilled laborers and domestic servants they were also among the leading performers in such sports as boxing and baseball and among popular entertainers  Sports and entertainment are highly competitive fields with many trying but few succeeding Yet the crucial qualities skills and talents tend to be individual and do not require an elaborate infrastructure of

other contexts having facts is not the same as seeing the implications of those facts    experience have followed in the footsteps of Irish Americans not only in sports and entertainment in general but even in many of the very same kinds of sports and entertainment in which Irish Americans once excelled so strikingly that is boxing and baseball rather than polo or golf popular music rather than symphonic music vaudeville performers rather than ballet dancers or Shakespearean actors   However demanding the skills or talents and however rare the individuals able to reach the peaks when the prerequisites for particular endeavors did not include an elaborate formal infrastructure such as that required to become a scientist a surgeon or an engineer economically and educationally lagging groups have often been overrepresented not only numerically but especially among the star performers  A whole succession of Irish American boxing champions in the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries from the era of John L Sullivan to that of Gene Tunney was followed by a succession of black American boxing champions beginning in the 1930s with the legendary Joe Louis who still holds the record for oneround knockouts in heavyweight championship fights Decades later the era of black boxing champions was succeeded by an era of Hispanic American boxing champions Similarly in baseball where despite a ban on black players in the major leagues until 1947 which is to say more than half a century after major league baseball began there were seven consecutive years when no white man won the National Leagues Most Valuable Player award6 and now 5 of the top 10 players who hit the most home runs in their careers are black7 Here too the era of black dominance among baseball stars was followed by  228 Wealth Poverty and Politics    There was an isolated black heavyweight champion Jack Johnson beginning in 1908 but the succession of black champions began with Joe Louis    an era when a wholly disproportionate number of baseball stars were Hispanic  It was not only among some ethnic groups but also among white Southerners that a lagging group in economic and educational terms produced many stars in sports and entertainment Although white Southerners have long been no more than onethird of the white population of the country in baseball four of the top five highest lifetime batting averages were by white players born in the South Ty Cobb 367 in Georgia Rogers Hornsby 358 in Texas Shoeless Joe Jackson 356 in South Carolina and Tris Speaker 345 in Texas  The lone nonSoutherner among the top five Ed Delahanty had a lifetime batting average of 3468 His career began earlier in the late nineteenth century and continued into the early twentieth century encompassing an era with such other Irish baseball stars as Wee Willie Keeler 343 lifetime batting average Eddie Collins 333 John J McGraw 333 James Edward Tip ONeill 326 Roger Connor 317 Jim ORourke 310 and Michael King Kelly 308 who at his peak led the National League in batting with 354 in 1884 and 388 in 18869 Among the Irish pitching stars of that era was Iron Man McGinnity who led the National League in games pitched in six different seasons was a 35game winner with an earned run average of 161 in 1904 and became renowned for sometimes pitching both games of a doubleheader10  While some might imagine that sports involve only physical skills it is harder to believe that when it comes to entertainers and especially musicians and musical composers Here again there has been a fault line between the kinds of entertainment requiring a formal infrastructure of education and training such as ballet and classical music versus popular music and dance where individual talents and creativity are key Among musical instruments the violin  Epilogue 229    In 1990 17 percent of major league baseball players were black and 13 percent were Hispanic By 2014 however only 82 percent of major

  requires formal training while the piano can be selftaught even though becoming a top popular pianist has been a rare triumph Here black American musicians have not merely held their own but excelled and created musical genres that became popular across America and even internationally Black composers emerged early in the twentieth century with Scot Joplin and WC Handy followed later by a new more sophisticated musical genre created by Duke Ellington and others  Here again with entertainment as with sports what blacks achieved was preceded by similar achievements by the Irish before them Hispanics after them and by white Southerners A whole line of famous Irish American singers in the early twentieth century was climaxed by Bing Crosby as the leading entertainer in the first half of the twentieth century and in 1947 he was named Most Popular Living Person in a radio poll11 It was said that through his recordings radio broadcasts and movies his voice was heard by more people around the world than the voice of any other human being at that time Later there were famous Hispanic entertainers and white Southern entertainers went from being regionally prominent to being nationally famous with Elvis Presley becoming an international icon Billboard magazines 2010 rankings of the Top 100 Artists 19552009 had Elvis Presley first with a large lead over The Beatles in second place12  Even within sports there are areas where the skills required for success are clearly and unmistakably not physical These would include baseball broadcasters whose renown put them in the Baseball Hall of Fame such as Red Barber Mel Allen Russ Hodges and Ernie Harwell all four of whom were from the 1940s and 1950s heyday of radio sportscasters and all of them white Southerners13 What is especially remarkable is that these broadcasters became famous in an era when there was not one major league baseball team in the entire South To become major league broadcasters they had to move to other regions of the country and compete with people living there in order to get a job and then to become renowned in their field  230 Wealth Poverty and Politics    Despite the poverty and backwardness of many mountain peoples on every inhabited continent there have been areas in which they too excelled A sweeping spectrum of elegant handicrafts have for centuries poured out of mountain communities around the world Among the mountain handicraft products in demand internationally have been shawls from Kashmir and watches and clocks from Switzerland France and the Black Forest region of southern Germany14 Because of high transportation costs from mountains to the outside world only articles with a high value concentrated in a small physical size could find a market in the lowlands and be sold successfully in competition with products produced in the lowlands At one time in centuries past villages in the Pindus Mountains of Greece developed high skills in metalworking and wool processing producing fine handiwork in gold and silver and exquisitely embroidered woolens which found markets from Istanbul to Vienna Silk handicrafts flourished for a time in the mountains of Greece Italy and Morocco though these eventually succumbed to competition from Asia where silk originated15  In the Andes weaving techniques were adapted to the hair of the llamas16 From the mountains of Tibet came many high quality handicraft products based on the same social circumstances as in other mountains around the world namely great amounts of free time in the winters spent indoors where special skills could be developed and practiced From the deposits of silver and gold in that region Tibetans made jewelry and from local woods various artistic objects were designed and carved In other parts of the world other mountain and highland peoples also used local resources to produce various local specialties such as dolls rugs lace and violin strings As a distinguished geographer once said Most of these mountain industries merely supplement the scant agricultural resources they represent the efforts of industrious but hard pressed people to eke out their meager subsistence17 In the process many became skilled weavers potters dye makers wood carvers stone carvers and jewelers18  Epilogue 231    No matter how lagging poor or backward particular peoples may be at particular times or even for centuries it is hard to find large groups of human beings so lacking in skills or talents as to be fit only to be the proverbial hewers of wood and drawers of water though some welfare state policies and practices have reduced some people to a level where they cannot or will not come up to even that modest level of productivity  While it may be readily understandable that lagging groups can find some niche in which they can hold their own what is striking is that such groups often do not merely hold their own but are especially successful in reaching the peaks more so than the population at large including other groups who greatly outperform them in many other kinds of endeavors This pattern however seems consistent with lagging groups and advanced groups being innately not very different if different at all but different primarily in whether they have or do not have the full ensemble of factors required for success in various fields even if the lagging group has most of these factors but lacks part of the ensemble that comes from either internal culture or external circumstances  If so then it is not surprising that a backlog as it were of innate potential unable to come to fruition in other fields would be concentrated in the fields where the prerequisites are met and therefore make groups lagging elsewhere be among the top performers in the fields accessible to them What is also consistent with this hypothesis is that when groups rise out of the status of lagging groups Irish Americans being a classic example and become part of the mainstream of American achievements in a variety of fields they tend also to forfeit their predominance among the stars in sports and entertainment   Against this background many current assumptions and beliefs are hard to sustain One of these current notions is that lagging groups require a lowering of existing standards so that more of their members can advance via various forms of affirmative action Yet the fields in which many lagging minorities have had their greatest  232 Wealth Poverty and Politics    success especially sports and entertainment are fields notorious for severe competition in which even star performers whose performances begin to decline are ruthlessly cast aside In short lagging minorities have flourished in endeavors whose conditions are the direct opposite of those of affirmative action They have had real achievements against unsparing competition rather than make believe achievements based on affirmative action quotas  Advocates of affirmative action who imagine that they can simply tack on whatever factors may be needed for individuals from lagging groups to succeed usually see this as something that can be done in the later stages of education at the college or university level when in fact it is seldom possible to make up for many years of substandard education or ingrained habits with negative consequences On the contrary affirmative action has too often taken minority students with all the prerequisites of success and turned them into artificial failures by mismatching them with institutions where most members of the general population would also fail Thus when black students were admitted to MIT with mathematics scores at the 90th percentile this left them in the bottom 10 percent at MIT where the other students were at the 99th percentile More than onefifth of these black students dropped out while most of those who remained performed below the level of their white classmates19  In other words black students with qualifications that would have made them candidates for honors at most colleges and universities were artificially turned into failures at MIT Conversely when affirmative action was banned in the University of California system the proportion of black and Hispanic students who graduated increased substantially as did their grades and their graduation rates in challenging fields like mathematics science and engineering  Another popular notion of our time is an expectation of equal economic outcomes for groups in the absence of malign treatment by others Neither more fortunate nor less fortunate groups are randomly distributed Instead different kinds of groups have very different patterns of distribution in different kinds of endeavors In the bitter  Epilogue 233    battles between those who ascribe different results to external barriers and those who ascribe them to internal deficiencies both often ignore the possibility that what people want to do or do not want to do is a factor not to be overlooked These culturally shaped preferences can make the abilityversusbarriers dichotomy irrelevant in particular cases With all the innate ability in the world and with all the doors of opportunity wide open people who have no desire to do X have very little likelihood of doing X either well or badly  Given multiple factors required for success in many endeavors including some in which people with most or perhaps almost all of these factors may nevertheless be complete failures there is no reason to expect either even or random patterns of success Nor is there any basis for expecting a persistence of a given uneven pattern of success over time especially when the particular prerequisites can change over time Nor can a general presumption of malign actions by others being behind the fate of the less fortunate be sustained with logic much less evidence despite how common that assumption has become in American courts of law under the disparate impact theory of discrimination or how common that same presumption has been in other nations as well  The presumption of equal outcomes in the absence of malign actions can lead to incorrect and disastrous conclusions in other circumstances as well When Dr Marcus Whitman treated both indigenous American Indians and white Americans for measles in the Pacific northwest in 1847 the estimated death rate among the Indians was 50 percent and among the whites was 15 percent at most Other Indians did not regard this pattern which involved the deaths of their loved ones as just a matter of random chance Blaming their deaths on some malign action by Dr Whitman they killed him and his wife among other whites massacred or enslaved20 However the whites and the Indians who were ill differed in one crucial factor the greater exposure of people of European origin to many diseases with which the Indians had historically had no contact and therefore had developed no biological resistance  234 Wealth Poverty and Politics    Something similar sometimes happened in medieval Europe when epidemics struck When the rate of infection and death was noticeably lower among Jews than among Gentiles demagogues were able to convince some people that Jews must somehow be behind the epidemic and were sparing themselves Where enough people believed this story it could lead to mass violence against Jews What no one knew at the time was that unseen microorganisms were the cause of these epidemics Because Jewish religious practices required them to pray before every meal and since they could not go before God with dirty hands they also had to wash their hands before every meal Neither Jews nor Gentiles knew about germs at this point but their cultural differences had serious consequences in their susceptibility to communicable diseases  These were neither the first nor the last times when statistical disparities led people to jump to conclusions about villainy being the cause False assumptions are more than intellectual errors and their consequences go far beyond economic losses  GOALS  While goals are in principle quite different from facts we may all agree on the facts and yet desire to pursue very different goals many goals are based on a particular set of beliefs about what the existing facts are If the less fortunate peoples of the world are less fortunate primarily because they are victims of the more fortunate then the goal to pursue in trying to make things right can be very different from what the goal would be if the less fortunate are seen as people lacking the geographic cultural and other advantages enjoyed by others largely through no fault of theirs or of others Not only may goals differ between people with these very different conceptions of the facts so may the criteria by which progress is measured  Some might regard the spread of prosperity to human beings in general as the prime criterion of economic success Others especially  Epilogue 235    those who believe that the poor are poor because the rich are getting rich at their expense may be more likely to see the prime criterion as being a reduction or elimination of economic gaps and disparities which are equated with inequities Many people may be in favor of both these things and think of them as complementary goals when in fact beyond some point there are inescapable tradeoffs that can make the two goals incompatible in practice however desirable they may seem together in theory If everyones income doubles for example that will almost certainly reduce poverty but it will also increase economic gaps disparities and inequities Some nations have in fact had their real per capita income double over varying periods of time  Obviously some people may value the spread of prosperity more than the reduction of inequality while others prefer the opposite When China after the death of Mao abandoned the original Communist emphasis on economic egalitarianism and adopted more marketoriented reforms under Deng Xiaoping who said Let some people get rich first21 the economic growth rate hit new highs and literally hundreds of millions of people rose out of poverty22 That a country historically plagued by famines including a famine under Mao in which tens of millions died became a country in which about onefourth of the adult population is now overweight is one measure of the change But such marketdriven rises in per capita real income have not been evenly spread in China any more than in other places and times whether within nations or between nations   When prosperity is widespread even if not equalized that may be of more significance to those released from the worst deprivations of grinding poverty than would reductions in the statistical gaps between the poor and the rich A lowincome mother whose sick babys chances of dying in infancy have been cut in half as a result of rising prosperity is unlikely to think of this as inconsequential much less a grievance even if she learns that a rich mothers babys smaller chances of dying in infancy have also been cut in half or by more than half   236 Wealth Poverty and Politics    Preoccupation with disparities gaps and inequities has largely been the hallmark of the intelligentsia the media and politicians Yet the people whose lives have been most changed by rising levels of prosperity around the world have often been those who were most lacking in basic things before Thus even a redistributionist has noted that the population growth in lowincome countries has increased at a higher rate than in more affluent countries23 This has largely been due to growing economic prosperity and advances in medical knowledge originating in more affluent countries  If the desperately poor people in the Italian mountain village described by Edward C Banfield in the midtwentieth century were later enabled to add some meat to their diet even if only hamburgers or frankfurters that might be a more meaningful benefit to them than if people in a more affluent society could afford more steak or lobster Being able to afford motor scooters might add more to the range of the mountain villagers mobility than if a rich family bought a second Rolls Royce In their book Free to Choose Rose and Milton Friedman pointed out such patterns more generally  Industrial progress mechanical improvement all of the great wonders of the modern era have meant relatively little to the wealthy The rich in Ancient Greece would have benefited hardly at all from modern plumbing running servants replaced running water Television and radio the patricians of Rome could enjoy the leading musicians and actors in their home could have the leading artists as domestic retainers Readytowear clothing supermarkets all these and many other modern developments would have added little to their life They would have welcomed the improvements in transportation and in medicine but for the rest the great achievements of Western capitalism have redounded primarily to the benefit of the ordinary person24  Epilogue 237    On a personal note at a dire time in my life as a young man I pawned my one suit in order to get money to be able to eat After emerging from a pawn shop on the Lower East Side of New York which was a predominantly Jewish neighborhood at that time I went into a nearby eating place and ordered a knish and an orange soda Many years later I would eat at the Waldorf Astoria in Parisian restaurants and in the White House  But no meal ever topped that knish and orange soda    Back in 1836 Nathan Rothschild one of the richest men in the world and perhaps the richest died from an infection that defied the efforts of leading doctors summoned to his side25 Today the poorest child of a welfare mother in America is unlikely to die from that same infection because economic and medical advances present routine cures for such things This happened not because governments intervened to prevent people from becoming as rich as Nathan Rothschild but because people in some countries remained free to work out their own lives and make their own mutual accommodations on such terms as they could with their fellow human beings and it was largely from such countries that the technological and medical advances came  Emphasis on income distribution and especially redistribution to the neglect of production downplays the benefits to society at large and to the poor especially from what is produced in the course of earning higher incomes As new better and often cheaper products spread throughout societies around the world much of this output benefits people of all sorts which is the very reason why millions of people are willing to pay for it and thus create fortunes such as that of Bill Gates and others  Since the reduction of poverty and the closing of economic gaps are competing goals on what basis can we choose between them One basis might be what is actually achievable and at what cost There is a serious question as to whether economic equality even approximate equality can be achieved at all since economic achievements depend on things largely beyond any governments control such as geography or totally beyond anyones control such as the past That does not mean that we can do nothing but it does suggest that we cannot do everything that strikes us as desirable  Even leaving aside all practical issues arising from conflicts between the goal of increasing prosperity and the goal of reducing gaps the  238 Wealth Poverty and Politics    It is not that money income trickles down to the poor a proposition advocated by no one but used as a straw man by many See my monograph TrickleDown Theory and Tax Cuts for the Rich    achievement of equal incomes can be literally impossible when equality in one sense is inherently incompatible with equality in another sense  To take the most extreme case even if every American man woman and child had equal individual incomes that would still leave substantial inequalities in household incomes because households that are in the top 20 percent of income recipients today contain millions more people than households in the bottom 20 percent Such households would remain in higher income brackets if incomes were made equal among all individuals If we restrict income equality to adults there would be even more inequality between households since households consisting of a single mother with multiple children would not have as much income per person as households consisting of two parents and their children even if welfare paid the single mother as much as other adults received for working   Putting aside the case of literal equality between every individual or every individual adult if by some miracle it were possible to have all individuals in all groups attain both the same quantitative levels of education as measured by number of years in school and also the same qualitative levels as measured by mastery of subjects of the same difficulty and economic rewards that would still leave intractable differences in age which would mean inescapable differences in experience since when the age of adulthood is eighteen a fortyyear old worker has more than ten times as much work experience as a twentyyearold worker  In these circumstances even if every twentyyearold Puerto Rican in the United States had identical incomes with every twentyyear old Japanese American and similar equality at every other age that would still leave a major income inequality between these two groups since the average Japanese American is more than twenty years older than the average Puerto Rican In short even extraordinary and unprecedented equalizations among individuals could still leave major statistical inequalities among groups This raises a crucial question What are the consequences of choosing and fervently proclaiming an unreachable goal   Epilogue 239    Theoretically everyone could get together and agree on which particular definition of equality they would use so that it would then at least be possible to have equality But what incentive would there be to do that in an atmosphere where every disparity or gap is seen as an intolerable grievance redeemable by various benefits to be supplied by others Whatever the merits of any particular definition of equality of outcomes what must be faced are the consequences of perpetually promoting a fervent crusade perpetually frustrated by its own internal contradictions but whose frustration is instead blamed on some human enemies of a sacred cause   Those who are in the business of protesting grievances are not going to stop protesting or taking disruptive or violent action because equality has been achieved by one definition when equality by one definition precludes equality by some other definitions In this context such phrases as No justice no peace are a declaration of unending internal strife since justice by one definition is injustice by another But no society has inexhaustible patience with unending turmoil If history is any guide it is only a matter of time before patience is exhausted and severe repressive measures are imposed to the ultimate detriment of the whole society   Again if history is any guide no amount of progress toward an unreachable goal can satisfy fiercely promoted aspirations seen as sacred so that all remaining unfulfilled hopes are seen as intolerable impositions of injustice Some have argued from history that major social upheavals have often occurred when social problems were in fact lessening but not at a pace comparable to rising expectations If so it may be more than coincidence that the wave of ghetto riots that swept across the United States in the 1960s began just days after passage of the Voting Rights Act of 1965 the capstone of historic civil rights legislation that had preceded   Preoccupation with income differences and with political crusades against them have not seized the minds and emotions of the general public to anything like the degree to which such preoccupations have dominated the thinking of the intelligentsia The obsession of the  240 Wealth Poverty and Politics    intelligentsia with economic gaps and disparities has not usually been shared by the public at large   This has been true even in many countries with the most poisonous form of this obsession resentment and hatred of ethnic minorities who are more productive and therefore more prosperous than the population at large A scholarly study of Romania between the two World Wars for example found that the antiJewish mood proved most rampant among the middle and upper classes and among the intellectuals26 It was much the same story of hostile reactions to other minority businessmen and professionals in other countries around the world   An international treatise on ethnic conflicts found that the supposed economic resentments of businessmen by their customers often do not exist27 Malays often preferred dealing with Chinese shopkeepers for example28 Maharashtrians preferred shopping at businesses run by nonMaharashtrians in Bombay now Mumbai in the late twentieth century29 In Indonesia and Burma indigenous farmers often preferred dealing with Arab moneylenders in Indonesia and Indian moneylenders in Burma to dealing with government moneylenders of their own ethnicity even though the latter offered lower interest rates30 Boycotts of Indian businesses in Uganda in 19591960 and of Japanese businesses in Peru in 1930 lacked public support31 But such boycotts and other actions against minority businesses have been supported by indigenous business rivals in these and other countries as an obvious matter of selfinterests and by the respective intelligentsia on ideological grounds   African university students have been hostile toward Indian businessmen in Uganda Lebanese businessmen in Nigeria Ghana and Senegal Armenian businessmen in Ethiopia32 The Third World intelligentsia have seldom had any business experience and greatly prefer government jobs to working in the private sector33 Similar hostility to business has long been common among intellectuals in more prosperous industrial societies as well It is not surprising that the goal of reducing economic inequalities has often permeated their  Epilogue 241    advocacies and actions With sufficient time persistence and fervor the obsessions of the intelligentsia can of course spread to the public at large but that is seldom where such zeal originates  More generally the crucial question in economic and social issues is whether the success of whatever goal is being pursued is measured by its tangible effects on human happiness or unhappiness or is instead measured by abstract numbers or other indicators of approaching a preconceived tableau Despite all the horrors under totalitarian Communist governments in the twentieth century it should not be forgotten that the Communist movements which led to such governments included people dedicated to equality to ending exploitation and to other humane goals Many in such movements were willing to risk or sacrifice their livelihoods or if necessary their lives in pursuit of these goals The willingness of many to also sacrifice their own integrity and the truth in order to forward the cause was a key factor in the political success of ruthless Communist leaders in imposing horrors with impunity   This was not unique to Communist movements Similar phenomena have existed in smaller messianic movements such as that which led to the Jonestown massacre in 1978 But the Communist movement was the largest and most thoroughly documented example of a movements implacable pursuit of an unachievable ideal and the demonizing of all who got in the way while lionizing ruthless leaders with unbridled powers including the power to make a mockery of the ideals of the movement itself and exterminate any of its members he chose   Communists are of course an extreme example But under any movement or set of collective beliefs being on the side of the angels can be a dangerous selfindulgence in a heedless willfulness sometimes called idealism This kind of idealism can seduce thinking into feeling replace realities with preconceptions and make the over riding goal the victory of some abstract vision in defiance of reality or in disregard of the truth and the fate of fellow human beings   242 Wealth Poverty and Politics    ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS  One of the most general acknowledgements that needs to be made more often than it is is that we all stand on the shoulders of giants I am especially awed and indebted to those who have obviously invested great amounts of time and wisdom writing monumental treatises from The Chinese in Southeast Asia by Victor Purcell to Human Accomplishment by Charles Murray America in Black and White by Stephan Thernstrom and Abigail Thernstrom Influences of Geographic Environment by Ellen Churchill Semple Ethnic Groups in Conflict by Donald L Horowitz and a whole series of insightful and enlightening scholarly books on Europes history and geography by NJG Pounds  Other books more notable for their very high quality than for their physical size would include Life at the Bottom by Theodore Dalrymple Charles A Prices Southern Europeans in Australia and David S Landes The Wealth and Poverty of Nations No doubt the infirmities of memory mean that this brief list leaves out some equally worthy works among the hundreds of other publications consulted andor cited in this book But the list is offered as suggestive rather than definitive  There would of course be no point standing on the shoulders of these and other giants if we saw only what they saw and simply repeated what they had already said often quite well But we can at least look in different directions from the vantage point they give us   Then there are the many wrongheaded publications including specious Supreme Court decisions which have spurred my examination of issues that I might not have noticed otherwise  But the authors of these wrongheaded notions might not fully appreciate my expressions of gratitude to them by name in this context  243    Closer to home it would be hard to exaggerate how much I owe to my research assistants of many years Na Liu and Elizabeth Costa They have not simply gotten research material that I asked for but have participated more actively by seeking out and evaluating other material on their own initiative In addition Ms Costa has done the painstaking copyediting and factchecking while Ms Liu has created the Quark computer files from which the finished manuscript can be printed directly into books   All of this takes place with the support and under the auspices of the Hoover Institution utilizing the vast library resources of Stanford University My wife Mary and my friend of many years Joseph Charney both gave critiques of the original version of Chapter 1 that caused it to be drastically revised and improved  All

Washington US Bureau of the Census 2001 p 2  16 The phrase income distribution leads some people to reason as if there is some preexisting block of income or wealth created somehow that is then divided up among individuals or groups In reality it is the process of creating wealth that leads to individual incomes being received in exchange for individual productivity in that process These individual incomes may later be added up by others into a verbally collectivized national income which is then spoken of as being distributed to individuals or groups Sometimes the same way of thinking is applied internationally leading to laments about such things as how Americans for example consume a disproportionate share of the worlds output But there is no one named World who produces all output or indeed any output at all Americans essentially consume what Americans produce using a portion of what they produce to exchange for an equivalent amount of imported goods from others In a purely figurative statistical sense income can be said to be distributed in the same sense in which there is a statistical distribution of heights in a population without anyone imagining that these heights exist collectively and are then sent out to individuals Those who believe that income or wealth should be collectivized in reality and then be shared out are of course free to advocate such an economic system explicitly but that is very different from insinuating such a process with words that have more than one meaning  17 Henry Hazlitt The Wisdom of Henry Hazlitt IrvingtononHudson New

cry about I guess its always best to laugh in these   situations because crying makes you look like a sissy boy and   frankly I find that kind of thing disgusting  In this video Im gonna recount my rise from grace or how this   became hotter than this   These are their stories  I mentioned in my last video that in college I studied neuroscience   Well I actually worked as a research assistant in couple labs and   thats when I realized that on a daytoday basis neuroscience is   less about unlocking the secrets of consciousness than it is about   collecting volumes of fMRI images of brains of people looking at   pictures of faces while tasting something good versus tasting human   shit and then using soontobediscredited statistical methods to   analyze those images  I dont know maybe that is how you unlock the secrets of   consciousness but I got pretty bored with it at the time  So I added a second major in philosophy thinking that was   guaranteed to be more exciting I mean it was advertised as a quest   for truth beauty and justice Oh the folly of youth  I guess what I liked about philosophy as an undergrad was that you   get go on this multimillennial drivethru of ideas reading Plato one   week then Kant then Foucault It was like a guided tour of   European historys most boring homosexuals  So I graduated and put my philosophy degree to use at a job as a   Segway tour guide before realizing that I was unequipped to deal   with the private sector they expect results  So I applied to philosophy PhD programs and got accepted at a   pretty good one And for the next two years I lived like a goddamn   httpsaardvarklilyk2lzsquarespacecom   7192020 Archived Transcript of Why I Quite Academia  ContraPoints

since you get exposed to a lot of new   information very quickly But whether youre in the sciences or   humanities when you advance to the graduate level youre   expected to focus In philosophy that means choosing a specialty   and eventually a research topic which youll spend several years   writing a dissertation about  Because there are hundreds of other people writing dissertations in   the field and youre expected to contribute something original you   end up having to narrow in on a research topic thats really   specialized So specialized in fact that it strains the human ability   to

MerleauPontys seminaturalistic   approach how are we ever going to develop an adequate critique   of Husserlian phenomenology This is a serious problem Good   thing someone spent the final years of his young life writing about it  httpsaardvarklilyk2lzsquarespacecom   7192020 Archived Transcript of Why I Quite Academia  ContraPoints

of writing   despite having inaccessible jargonladen titles  But you see the point Im trying to make The philosopher Daniel   Dennett said that much of academic philosophy amounts to   discovering higherorder truths about chmess chmess being a   variant on chess that nobody actually plays  I think theres a certain personality type that enjoys difficult   intellectual problems for their own sake and if thats you academia   might be a perfectly good place for you But its not for me  The worst for me were conferences where youd have to listen to   twelve straight hours of mindnumbing inconsequential scholastic   jabbering and then go to dinner to talk about it all over again I   used to just skip dinner and drink a pint of bourbon alone in my   hotel room and spy on people in the courtyard pool because   goddamn I needed to feel something Im honestly surprised my   health survived these years of my life Fortunately I have this   naturally gracile body thats easy to maintain  borderline bulimia jokes  P a r t  I I   p o l i t i c a l  r e a s o n s  Rightwing dingdongs like to paint academia as some sort of leftist   madrasa where Marxist feminism is the only permissible worldview   This is an exaggeration but its not that much of an exaggeration  I was once in an advanced political philosophy seminar with a   bunch of other grad students and the reading we were to discuss   that week was the libertarian philosopher Robert Nozicks book   Anarchy State and Utopia None of us in this seminar were able to   mount any plausible arguments against Nozick not because hes   correct but because we had so little experience arguing against   anything that far right Everyone in this room was a reasonably   httpsaardvarklilyk2lzsquarespacecom   7192020 Archived

dissecting the little squabbles between Rawls and   Habermas and we had no experience arguing against anything as   far right as the political views that most Americans actually hold  Now maybe its okay to focus on these little quibbles and not get   bogged down with defending the basics of your worldview but I   personally find that boring I dont give a damn about the petty   infighting between French neoMarxists and Italian neoMarxists I   want to see the critical theory people debate the libertarians Now   thats a conference Id fucking pay to go to But that kind of thing   doesnt happen very much in academia You have to go to YouTube   for the real entertainment and also frankly for the real debate  Theres also a certain amount of genuine leftist bullshit passing itself   off as scholarship I was once in a comparative literature seminar   that I foolishly took in the hopes of getting to read something written   with a decent prose style or at least something by an emotionally   competent human being Boy was I disappointed when on the first   day the professor made two allusions to my good friend Derrida   Those are quotation marks around my good friend because he   mentioned that Derrida was his friend every time it came up Pass   the cyanide honey  Anyway the low point of this guys endless beginningless   argumentfree impromptu lectures came when he baldly asserted   that the poetry of Milton had a direct influence on the workings of   ISIS Yes this would be John Milton the 17th century English poet   and ISIS the contemporary Syrian terrorist organization And what   evidence did the professor adduce in support of this outrageous   claim None whatsofuckingever And the other grad students in the   room just sat there nodding knowingly taking notes like a bunch of   sycophants No one raised their hand no one said Excuse me   professor but what in Jesus name are you fucking talking about I   didnt even say anything I had no spine  httpsaardvarklilyk2lzsquarespacecom   7192020 Archived Transcript of Why I Quite Academia  ContraPoints  httpsaardvarklilyk2lzsquarespacecomtranscriptsarchivesquitacademia 68  The only explanation I can think of for this was that the professor   had this reflexive hatred of himself of English literature of basically   all of Western culture and so he had to hallucinate that Islamic   terrorism is in some way the outcome of overzealously reading   Paradise Lost  I guess this is what being good friends with Derrida does to you  And can someone remind me again how studying this shit is helpful   to the working class Oh thats right it isnt its just a bunch of   uppermiddleclass white people discovering higher order truths   about chmess  Now I mightve been able to put up with all this if Id been sure that   there was a stable career ahead of me But there was no such thing   Universities take on more grad students than there are academic   jobs and tenuretrack positions are rapidly disappearing with   temporary adjunct positions taking their place Now if you have a   PhD in physics or economics you can always go into the private   sector But in philosophy there is no private sector No one is   expecting results There are no results  Pure love is the only justification for doing it and I didnt love it  So I realized that I couldnt live with myself if I continued on I   finished my masters coursework and I quit There was an   unexpected coda to my academic career last spring when an old   professor of mine got sick and I was hired to teach his class for him   So I did get to taste absolute power once but now that thats over   Im out  Over the last year Ive been employed as a legal assistant an Uber   driver and a copywriter  Add comfort and style to your
